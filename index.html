You may try to manage one problem after another&#x2013; diuretics to treat blood pressure, statins to lower cholesterol, metformin and insulin to treat diabetes--without fully realizing that the root of these issues is insulin resistance which revs up inflammation, damages the immune system, and disrupts the whole hormonal/chemical system in the body.</p><p>It's time to feel better and get healthy by following a simple step-by-step plan to a healthy lifestyle.

D. Robb.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>The shots came quickly, silently, and with deadly accuracy. Within seconds, three people were dead at Central Park&#x2019;s ice-skating rink. The victims: a talented young skater, a doctor, and a teacher. As random as random can be.<br><br>Eve Dallas has seen a lot of killers during her time with the NYPSD but never one like this. A review of the security videos reveals that the victims were killed with a tactical laser rifle fired by a sniper, who could have been miles away when the trigger was pulled. And though the list of locations where the shooter could have set up seems endless, the number of people with that particular skill set is finite: police, military, professional killer.<br><br>Eve&#x2019;s husband, Roarke, has unlimited resources&#x2014;and genius&#x2014;at his disposal. And when his computer program leads Eve to the location of the sniper, she learns a shocking fact: There were two&#x2014;one older, one younger. Someone is being trained by an expert in the science of killing, and they have an agenda. Central Park was just a warm-up. And as another sniper attack shakes the city to its core, Eve realizes that though we&#x2019;re all shaped by the people around us, there are those who are just born evil...</p><p><b>J. D. Robb</b> is the pseudonym for a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than 200 novels, including the bestselling In Death series. There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.1 <br><br>When Lieutenant Eve Dallas strode into the bullpen of Homicide after an annoying appearance in court, she wanted coffee. But Detective Jenkinson had obviously been lying in wait. He popped up from his desk, started toward her, leading with his obnoxious tie of the day.<br><br>&#x201c;Are those frogs?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;Why would you wear a tie with piss-yellow frogs jumping around on&#x2014;Christ&#x2014;puke-green lily pads?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Frogs are good luck. It&#x2019;s feng shui or some shit. Anyways, the fresh meat you brought in took a pop in the eye from some chemi-head down on Avenue B. She and Uniform Carmichael hauled him and the dealer in. They&#x2019;re in the tank. New girl&#x2019;s in the break room with an ice patch. Figured you&#x2019;d want to know.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Fresh meat</i> equaled the newly transferred Officer Shelby. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d she handle it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like a cop. She&#x2019;s all right, LT.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good to know.&#x201d;<br><br>She really wanted coffee&#x2014;and not crap break-room coffee, but the <i>real</i> coffee in her office AutoChef. But she&#x2019;d brought Officer Shelby on board, and on her first full day she&#x2019;d taken a fist in the eye.<br><br>So Eve, tall and lanky in her black leather coat, walked to the break room.<br><br>Inside, Shelby sat drinking crap coffee, squinting at her PPC while wearing a cold patch over her right eye. She started to get to her feet, but Eve gestured her down.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the eye, Officer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My kid sister hits harder, Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br><br>At Eve&#x2019;s finger motion, Shelby lifted the patch.<br><br>The bloodshot white, the black and purple raying out from it had Eve nodding. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice one. Stick with the patch awhile.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>On the way to her office, she stopped by Uniform Carmichael&#x2019;s cube. &#x201c;Run it through for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Detectives Carmichael and Santiago caught one down on Avenue B. We&#x2019;re support, just crowd control. We spot the illegals deal going down, five feet away. Can&#x2019;t just ignore it, but since we&#x2019;ve got a body coming out, we&#x2019;re just going to move them along. Dealer? He&#x2019;s hands up, no problem. Chemi-head&#x2019;s jonesing some, and he just punched her. Sucker punch, sir. She took him down, and fast, I&#x2019;ll give her that. A little bit on the reckless side, maybe, but it&#x2019;s her eye his fist punched. We hauled them both in, with assaulting an officer added to the doper.<br><br>&#x201c;She can take a punch,&#x201d; Uniform Carmichael added. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give her that, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keep her tight for a few days, and let&#x2019;s see how she rolls.&#x201d;<br><br>Before somebody else wanted her for anything else, Eve cut straight through to her office. She programmed coffee, black, without bothering to take off her coat.<br><br>She stood by her skinny window drinking the coffee, her whiskey-�colored cop&#x2019;s eyes scanning the street traffic below, the sky traffic above.<br><br>She had paperwork&#x2014;there was always paperwork&#x2014;and she&#x2019;d get to it. But she had just closed an ugly case, and had spent the morning testifying over another ugly case. She supposed they were all ugly, but some twisted harder than others.<br><br>So she wanted a minute with her coffee and the city she&#x2019;d sworn to protect and serve.<br><br>Maybe, if she was lucky, a quiet night would follow. Just her and Roarke, she thought. Some wine, some dinner, maybe a vid, some sex. When a murder cop ended up with a busy, billionaire businessman, quiet nights at home were like the biggest, shiniest prize in the box.<br><br>Thank God he wanted those quiet nights, too.<br><br>Maybe sometimes they did the fancy bits&#x2014;it was part of the deal, part of the Marriage Rules in her book. And more than sometimes he worked with her over pizza in her home office. The reformed criminal with the mind of a cop? A hell of a tool.<br><br>So maybe a quiet night for both of them.<br><br>She set the coffee on her desk, took off her coat and tossed it over her deliberately uncomfortable visitor&#x2019;s chair. Paperwork, she reminded herself, and started to rake her hand through her hair. Hit the snowflake hat she tried not to let embarrass her. After tossing that on top of the coat, she finger-combed her short, choppy cap of brown hair, sat.<br><br>&#x201c;Computer,&#x201d; she began, and her desk &#x2019;link sounded.<br><br>&#x201c;Dallas.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Dispatch, Dallas, Lieutenant Eve.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Even before the rest, she knew the shiny prize would have to stay in the box for a while.<br><br>With her partner, Eve walked from Sixth Avenue where she&#x2019;d double-parked her DLE.<br><br>With a scarf of purple-and-green zigzags wrapped around her neck, Peabody clomped along the path, shooting unhappy looks at the snow blanketing everything else.<br><br>&#x201c;I figured, hey, we&#x2019;ll be in court, and we got temps in the forties, I can wear my cowgirl boots no problem. If we&#x2019;ve got to go tramping through the snow&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s January. And what cop wears pink to a murder trial?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Reo had on red shoes,&#x201d; Peabody pointed out, referring to the APA. &#x201c;Red&#x2019;s just dark pink when you think about it.&#x201d;<br><br>When Eve thought about it, she wondered why the hell they were talking about footwear when they had three DBs on tap. &#x201c;Suck it up.&#x201d;<br><br>She flashed her badge when they came to the first police line, kept walking&#x2014;ignored reporters who pushed against that line and shouted questions.<br><br>Somebody had their head on right, she decided, holding the media hounds back out of sight of the rink. That wouldn&#x2019;t last, but it kept what was bound to be complicated a little simpler for the time being.<br><br>She spotted more than a dozen uniforms coming or going and at least fifty civilians. Raised voices, a few edged with hysteria, carried clearly.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought we&#x2019;d have more civilians, more witnesses.&#x201d;<br><br>Eve kept scanning. &#x201c;Bodies drop, people run. We probably lost half of them before the first-on-scene got here.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Media doesn&#x2019;t need to get within camera range. They&#x2019;re going to have dozens of people sending them vids.&#x201d;<br><br>Since nothing could be done about that, Eve set it aside, flashed through the next barricade.<br><br>As she did, a uniform peeled off, lumbered toward her. She recognized the thirty-plus-years vet, and knew the relative order established was due to his experience and no-bullshit style.<br><br>&#x201c;Fericke.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave her a nod. He had a dark bulldog face on a broad-chested bulldog body. And eyes of bitter chocolate-brown that had seen it all, and expected to see worse at any moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Hell of a mess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Run it through for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Got the first dispatch at &#x2019;round fifteen-twenty. I&#x2019;m baby-walking a rook, and had him doing some foot patrol on Sixth, so we hotfooted it. Had him start a line back aways, keep people out. But Christ on a crutch, you can&#x2019;t block the whole freaking park.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re first-on-scene.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Nine-one-ones started pumping in and so did cops, but people were already running from the scene when I got here. Had to work with park security to hold what we could. Had some injuries. We got MTs in to treat the minors, but we had a kid, about six, broken leg. The way the wit reports shake out&#x2014;once you cut through the crap&#x2014;is the first vic collided with him and the kid&#x2019;s parents, and the kid&#x2019;s leg got broke in the fall. Got their contact info, and the hospital for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Peabody.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that information, Officer.&#x201d;<br><br>He reeled it off without pulling out his notebook.<br><br>&#x201c;Sweepers aren&#x2019;t going to be happy about the state of the crime scene. People all the fuck over it, and the bodies&#x2019;ve been moved around. Had a medical on the ice, and a vet&#x2014;an animal doc&#x2014;and they worked on the vics, and the injured.<br><br>&#x201c;First vic took it in the back. That&#x2019;s the female out there, in red.&#x201d; He turned, gestured with a lift of that bulldog chin. &#x201c;Wit statements aren&#x2019;t clear about which got hit second, but you got two males, one gut shot, one between the fucking eyes. Looks like a laser strike to me, LT, but I don&#x2019;t wanna tell you your job. And you&#x2019;re going to hear from some of these wits about knives and suspicious individuals, and the usual crap.&#x201d;<br><br>You didn&#x2019;t make lieutenant without wading through, and learning to cut through, the usual crap.<br><br>&#x201c;All right. You got the doctors on tap?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Got them inside the locker room, got another couple in there, too, who claim they were the first to reach one of the male vics. And the wife of one of the male vics. She&#x2019;s firm he was the last hit, and I lean toward that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Peabody, take them, and I&#x2019;ll start on the bodies. I want the security discs, and I want them now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They got them ready for you,&#x201d; Fericke told her. &#x201c;Ask for Spicher. He&#x2019;s rink security, and not altogether a dickhead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on it.&#x201d; Peabody headed off, careful to avoid the snow.<br><br>&#x201c;Gonna want some grippers for your boots,&#x201d; Fericke told Eve. &#x201c;Pile of them up there. Hotshot murder cop face-planting on the ice wouldn&#x2019;t inspire confidence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold the line, Fericke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what we do.&#x201d;<br><br>She walked around to the rink&#x2019;s entrance, strapping on a pair of the toothy grips before opening her field kit and sealing her hands and boots.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey! Hey! Are you in charge? Who&#x2019;s in fucking charge?&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced over, locking eyes with a red-faced man of about forty who was wearing a thick white sweater and black skin pants.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in charge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have no right to hold me! I have an appointment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Granger. Wayne Granger, and I know my rights!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Granger, do you see the three people lying on the rink?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I see them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Their rights trump yours.&#x201d;<br><br>He shouted after her as she worked her way across the ice to the �female victim, something about police states and lawsuits. Looking down at the girl in red&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t have been more than twenty years old&#x2014;Eve didn&#x2019;t give him another thought.<br><br>Blood pooled under her, spreading more red on the ice. She lay on her side, and Eve could clearly see bloody marks where other skaters, and the medicals, had gone through.<br><br>Her eyes, a bright, summer blue already glazed with death, stared, and one hand lay, palm up, in her own blood.<br><br>No, Eve didn&#x2019;t give Granger and his appointment another thought.<br><br>She crouched down, opening her field kit, and did her job.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t rise or turn when Peabody came out.<br><br>&#x201c;Vic is Ellissa Wyman, age nineteen. Still lives with her parents and younger sister, Upper West. TOD, fifteen-fifteen. ME will determine COD, but I agree with Fericke. It looks like a laser strike.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The doctors&#x2014;both of them&#x2014;agree. And the vet? He was an Army corpsman, so he&#x2019;s seen laser strikes. They didn&#x2019;t do more than look at her&#x2014;she was obviously gone. One tried working on the gut shot, and the other examined the head shot&#x2014;but they were all gone. So they �focused on the injured.&#x201d;<br><br>Eve rose with a nod. &#x201c;Security discs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right here.&#x201d;<br><br>Eve plugged one of the discs into her own PPC, cued it to fifteen-�fourteen, and focused first on the girl in red.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Peabody commented. &#x201c;Her form, I mean. She&#x2019;s building up some speed there, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She broke off when the girl shot through the air, form gone, and collided with the young family.<br><br>Eve rewound it, backed up another minute, and now scanned the other skaters, the onlookers.<br><br>&#x201c;People are giving her room,&#x201d; Eve murmured, &#x201c;some are watching her. I don&#x2019;t see any weapons.&#x201d;<br><br>She let it play through, watched the second victim jerk back, eyes widening, knees buckling.<br><br>Ran it back, noted the time. Ran it forward.<br><br>&#x201c;Less than six seconds between strikes.&#x201d;<br><br>People skated to the first vic and the family. Security came rushing out. And the couple skating&#x2014;poorly&#x2014;along the rail&#x2014;slowed. The man glanced back. And the strike.<br><br>&#x201c;Just over six seconds for the third. Three shots in roughly twelve seconds, three dead&#x2014;center back, gut, forehead. That&#x2019;s not luck. And none of those strikes came from the rink or around it. Tell Fericke, when he&#x2019;s got all names and contacts, that anyone who has given a statement can go. Except for the medicals and the third vic&#x2019;s wife.<br><br>&#x201c;Get a full statement from all three of them, and contact whoever the vic&#x2019;s wife wants. The female&#x2019;s cleared for bagging, tagging, and transpo to the morgue. And we need park security feeds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which sector?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Leaving Peabody gaping, Eve crossed the ice to the second victim.<br><br>When she finished with the bodies, she went inside.<br><br>The two medicals sat together on a bench in a locker area, drinking coffee out of go-cups.<br><br>Eve nodded to the uniform, dismissing her, then sat on the bench across from them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Dallas. You&#x2019;ve given statements to my partner, Detective Peabody.&#x201d;<br><br>They both nodded, the one on the left&#x2014;trim, close-shaven, mid-�thirties&#x2014;nodded. &#x201c;Nothing we could do for the three who were killed. By the time we got to them, they were gone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry. Dr. Lansing. I thought, I honestly thought the girl&#x2014;the girl in the red suit&#x2014;had just taken a bad spill. And the little boy, he was screaming. I was right there, that is, right behind them when it happened. So I tried to get to him, first. I started to move the girl, to get to the little boy, and realized she wasn&#x2019;t hurt or unconscious. I heard Matt shouting for everyone to get off the ice, to get clear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Matt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me. Matt Brolin. I saw the collision&#x2014;saw that girl go into her turn for a jump, saw her propelled forward into the family. I was going to go help, then I saw the guy go down, saw him drop. Even then I didn&#x2019;t put it together. But I saw the third one, I saw the strike, and I knew. I was a corpsman. Twenty-six years ago, but it doesn&#x2019;t leave you. We were under attack, and I wanted people to get to cover.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You two know each other.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We do now,&#x201d; Brolin said. &#x201c;I knew the third guy was gone&#x2014;hell of a sniper strike&#x2014;but I tried to do what I could for the second one. He was still alive, Lieutenant. He looked at me. I remembered that look&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s a hard one to remember. He wasn&#x2019;t going to make it, but you&#x2019;ve got to do what you can do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He shielded the guy with his own body,&#x201d; Lansing put in. &#x201c;People panicked, and I swear some would&#x2019;ve skated right over that man, but Matt shielded him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jack had his hands full with the little boy, and the parents got banged around some, too. Right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t have time to break their own fall,&#x201d; Lansing explained. &#x201c;The father&#x2019;s got a mild concussion, the mother&#x2019;s a sprained wrist. They&#x2019;ll be all right. The boy, too, but he got the worst of it. Security had a first aid kit. I gave him a little something for the pain. The MTs were here inside of two minutes. You have to give them credit. I went to help Matt. And we had to try on the last one. But like Matt said, he was gone. Gone before he hit the ice.&#x201d;</p><h2>Ramona&#39;s World (Ramona Series) (Ramona, 8)</h2><p><p><strong>Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning author Beverly Cleary's final book in the Ramona series has all of the warmth, realism, and humor of its predecessors.</strong> </p><p>Ramona Quimby can't wait to start fourth grade.

When Ramona's spelling is atrocious, her teacher, Mrs. Meacham, is firm about her needing to improve. Then a scary incident at a friend's house leaves Ramona feeling at fault. Who knew growing up could be filled with such complicated situations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Ramona Quimby is back! Beverly Cleary's best-loved and most exuberant character has been winning friends since the 1950s when she made her first appearance as Beezus's pesky little sister. Now, in Cleary's first Ramona book in 15 years, our beloved spitfire is 9 years old, and she fully intends to make fourth grade the best year of her life. Even with her spelling struggles, a new baby sister, and a fall through her best friend's ceiling, her wish seems to be coming true. Old friends Yard Ape and Howie are still around--and with her new best friend Daisy, Ramona is on top of her world! The ever-popular Cleary has been awarded many honors, including the prestigious Newbery Medal for <i>Dear Mr. Henshaw</i> in 1984. Two books in the Ramona series, <i>Ramona and Her Father</i> and <i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i>, were named Newbery Honor Books. Cleary's masterful expression of children's emotions endears her to the hearts of her young readers, time after time. Who else could know just what it feels like to accidentally make a funny face during the school pictures, or the dread of being forced to play with the annoyingly perfect Susan? Happily, Cleary is still teamed up with illustrator Alan Tiegreen, whose simple line drawings capture the most complex of childhood predicaments. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Read by Stockard Channing<br>2 hours 59 minutes, 2 cassettes<br><br>Ramona's back and more fun than ever as she enters the fourth grade in this newest addition to the Ramona series. And things are off to a rousing start for the perky ten year old when whe has a great first day of school, writing a gem of an essay about her new baby sister Roberta, and making a new best friend.

Bad Apple?<br><br>Twenty years ago, all the evil villains were banished from the kingdom of Auradon to the Isle of the Lost--a dark and dreary place protected by a force field that makes it impossible for them to leave. Stripped of their magical powers, the villains now live in total isolation, forgotten by the world.<br><br>Mal learns from her mother, Maleficent, that the key to true darkness, the Dragon's Eye, is located inside her scepter in the forbidden fortress on the far side of the island. The eye is cursed, and whoever retrieves it will be knocked into a deep sleep for a thousand years. But Mal has a plan to capture it. She'll just need a little help from her "friends." In their quest for the Dragon's Eye, these four kids begin to realize that just because you come from an evil family tree, being good ain't so bad.</p><p><strong>Melissa de la Cruz</strong> (www.melissa-delacruz.com) is the author of many best-selling novels, including all the books in the Blue Bloods series: <em>Blue Bloods</em>, <em>Masquerade</em>, <em>Revelations</em>, <em>The Van Alen Legacy, Keys to the Repository, Misguided Angel,</em> <em>Bloody Valentine, Lost in Time,</em> and <em>Gates of Paradise.</em> She lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband and daughter.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;All the evil villains of Disney movie fame have been exiled to the Isle of the Lost. A huge dome covers the island, keeping them from using any magic. They are relegated to eating scraps and wearing castoffs of the good citizens of Auradon, ruled by King Beast and Queen Belle. The children of Maleficient, Jabar, Evil Queen, and Cruella De Vil (respectively Mal, Jay, Evie, and Carlos) don't know any other life away from the island. Every aspect of their existence is focused on becoming more evil, and finding nefarious ways to entertain themselves. When Carlos invents a device that is meant to provide them with more cable channels, he inadvertently opens a hole in the dome, allowing a tiny bit of magic to reactivate Maleficient's scepter, the Dragon's Eye. The four go off on a quest to find the staff, each for their own selfish reasons. All the while, though, the descendants of the most evil villains to ever walk the earth are starting to (gasp!) show signs of caring for each other. And over on Auradon, Prince Ben, son of Beast and Belle, is having visions of a beautiful blue-haired girl he's never met, even though he's betrothed to Princess Audrey, daughter of Aurora. Clich�d characters and a predictable plot probably won't deter young readers from finishing this fun little romp through practically every Disney movie ever made. VERDICT Billed as a prequel to a Disney Channel movie, there's a built-in fan base for this story. Disney lovers and fairy-tale fans alike will need to get their hands on this book.&#x2014;Mandy Laferriere, Fowler Middle School, Frisco, TX</p><h2>Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View (Perennial Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>THE INSPIRATION FOR THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE <em>THE EXPERIMENTER</em></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;The classic account of the human tendency to follow orders, no matter who they hurt or what their consequences.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;Michael Dirda, <em>Washington Post Book World</em></strong></p><p>In the 1960s Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram famously carried out a series of experiments that forever changed our perceptions of morality and free will.

But he was much more than that!&nbsp;<br><br>Born in the West Indies, Hamilton arrived in New York as an immigrant, an outsider. He fought in the American Revolution and became George Washington's most valuable aide-de-camp. As one of America's Founding Fathers, he was there for the writing of the Constitution and became the first Secretary of the Treasury. Jean Fritz's award-winning talent for bringing history to life shines as she shares the true story of Alexander Hamilton, a man of action who was honorable, ambitious, and fiercely loyal to his adopted country.</p><p>Acclaimed biographer, Jean Fritz, was born in China to American missionaries on November 16, 1915. Living there until she was almost thirteen sparked a lifelong interest in American history. &nbsp;She wrote about her childhood in China in <i>Homesick, My Own Story, </i>a Newbery Honor Book and winner of the National Book Award.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Fritz was the author of forty-five books for children and young people. Many center on historical American figures, gaining her a reputation as the premier author of biographies for children and young people.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the other prestigious awards Ms. Fritz has garnered are: the National Humanities Medal, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture Award. the Christopher Award, the <i>Boston Globe-Horn Book </i>Non-Fiction Award, a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book of the Year, and many ALA Notable Books of the Year, <i>School Library Journal </i>Best Books of the Year, and ALA <i>Booklist</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice Awards.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She passed away on May 14, 2017.<i> </i>*Starred Review* Fritz, a notable biographer of the Revolutionary War period for young people, provides a brisk, well-written account introducing Founding Father Alexander Hamilton as an outsider to America. Raised in the West Indies, Hamilton traveled to New York for his education in 1773 and became immersed in the political turmoil that led to the Revolutionary War. Joining the army as an artillery captain, he became an aide-de-camp to General Washington and led an attack at Yorktown. After the war, he served in Congress, at the Constitutional Convention, and as the first secretary of the treasury before sustaining a mortal wound in a duel with his longtime rival, Aaron Burr. Fast moving and engaging, this straightforward biography acknowledges Hamilton&#x2019;s flaws while portraying him as an intelligent, energetic man who rose to the challenge of his times. In addition to the black-and-white reproductions of period paintings and prints that illustrate the text, Schoenherr&#x2019;s striking, engraving-like images of Hamilton as scholar, soldier, aide-de-camp, statesman, and duelist introduce each section. The appended section of notes deals with historical background information, rather than sources for facts or quotes, but a source bibliography is included. This lively biography sheds light on Hamilton&#x2019;s character and his place at the nation&#x2019;s beginnings.

Revised and Updated</h2><p>Fully revised with forty thousand new words that take the reader up to present-day India, John Keay&#x2019;s <i>India: A History</i> spans five millennia in a sweeping narrative that tells the story of the peoples of the subcontinent, from their ancient beginnings in the valley of the Indus to the events in the region today. In charting the evolution of the rich tapestry of cultures, religions, and peoples that comprise the modern nations of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, Keay weaves together insights from a variety of scholarly fields to create a rich historical narrative. Wide-ranging and authoritative, <i>India: A History</i> is a compelling epic portrait of one of the world&#x2019;s oldest and most richly diverse civilizations.</p><p>The history of what is now India stretches back thousands of years, further than that of nearly any other region on earth. Yet, observes historian John Keay, most historical work on India concentrates on the period after the arrival of Europeans, with predictable biases, distortions, and misapprehensions. One, for example, is the tendency to locate the source of social conflict in India's many religions--to which Keay retorts, "Historically, it was Europe, not India, which consistently made religion grounds for war."<p> Taking the longest possible view, Keay surveys what is both provable and invented in the historical record. His narrative begins in 3000 B.C., with the complex, and little-understood, Harappan period, a time of state formation and the development of agriculture and trade networks. This period coincides with the arrival of Indo-European invaders, the so-called Aryans, whose name, of course, has been put to bad use at many points since. Keay traces the growth of subsequent states and kingdoms throughout antiquity and the medieval period, suggesting that the lack of unified government made the job of the European conquerors somewhat easier--but by no means inevitable. He continues to the modern day, his narrative ending with Indian-Pakistani conflicts in 1998.</p><p> Fluently told and well documented, Keay's narrative history is of much value to students and general readers with an interest in India's past and present. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>John Keay is a writer, broadcaster and historian whose books include `Into India&#39;, `India Discovered&#39;, `When Men and Mountains Meet&#39;, `Highland Drove&#39;, `The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company&#39;, `The Great Arc&#39;, `China: A History&#39; and (with his wife, Julia Keay) the `Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland&#39;. He has travelled extensively in India and the Far East, and specialised in Asian history and current affairs.</p><h2>Devoted to God</h2><p>Christians are transformed by the renewing of their minds. They understand that in large measure how they think about the gospel will determine how they will live for God's glory. They learn to allow the word of God to do its own work, informing and influencing the way they think in order to shape the way they live.<br><br>In a series of Scripture-enriched chapters Sinclair B. Ferguson's <i>Devoted to God</i> works out this principle in detail. It provides what he describes as <strong>'blueprints for sanctification'</strong> an orderly exposition of central New Testament passages on holiness. <i>Devoted to God</i> thus builds a strong and reliable structural framework for practical Christian living. It stresses the foundational importance of fundamental issues such as union with Christ, the rhythms of spiritual growth, the reality of spiritual conflict, and the role of God's law. Here is a fresh approach to an always relevant subject, and a working manual to which the Christian can turn again and again for biblical instruction and spiritual direction.</p><p>Sinclair Buchanan Ferguson retired in 2013 as Senior Minister of First Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina, and returned to his native Scotland. Prior to this he held the Charles Krahe chair for Systematic Theology at Westminster Theological Seminary and served Church of Scotland congregations in Unst (Shetland) and Glasgow (St George s Tron). He received his Ph.D. from the University of Aberdeen (1971).<br><br>Dr Ferguson has authored several books published by the Trust, of which he is a trustee, and a former editor. He retains his position as Professor of Systematic Theology at Redeemer Seminary, Dallas, Texas, and serves as a Teaching Fellow with Ligonier Ministries.

In this groundbreaking book, he presents a new approach to understanding and changing couples: a fundamental social skill called &#x201c;emotional attunement,&#x201d; which describes a couple&#x2019;s ability to fully process and move on from negative emotional events, ultimately creating a stronger relationship.<br><br> Gottman draws from this longitudinal research and theory to show how emotional attunement can downregulate negative affect, help couples focus on positive traits and memories, and even help prevent domestic violence. He offers a detailed intervention devised to cultivate attunement, thereby helping couples connect, respect, and show affection. Emotional attunement is extended to tackle the subjects of flooding, the story we tell ourselves about our relationship, conflict, personality, changing relationships, and gender. Gottman also explains how to create emotional attunement when it is missing, to lay a foundation that will carry the relationship through difficult times.<br><br> Gottman encourages couples to cultivate attunement through awareness, tolerance, understanding, non-defensive listening, and empathy. These qualities, he argues, inspire confidence in couples, and the sense that despite the inevitable struggles, the relationship is enduring and resilient.<br><br> This book, an essential follow-up to his 1999 <em>The Marriage Clinic</em>, offers therapists, students, and researchers detailed intervention for working with couples, and offers couples a roadmap to a stronger future together.</p><p>John M.

He explains how the mafia began, how it responds to threats and challenges, and introduces us to the real-life characters that inspired the American imagination for generations, making the mafia an international, larger than life cultural phenomenon. Dickie's dazzling cast of characters includes Antonio Giammona, the first "boss of bosses''; New York cop Joe Petrosino, who underestimated the Sicilian mafia and paid for it with his life; and Bernard "the Tractor" Provenzano, the current boss of bosses who has been hiding in Sicily since 1963.</p></p><p>The Italian-American mafia has its roots in a mysterious and powerful criminal network in Sicily. While the mythology of the mafia has been widely celebrated in American culture, the true origins of its rituals, laws, and methods have never actually been revealed. John Dickie uses startling new research to expose the secrets of the Sicilian mafia, providing a fascinating account that is more violent, frightening, and darkly comic than anything conceived in popular movies and novels. How did the Sicilian mafia begin? How did it achieve its powerful grip in Italy and America? How does it operate today? From the mafia's origins in the 1860s to its current tense relationship with the Berlusconi government, <i>Cosa Nostra</i> takes us to the inner sanctum where few have dared to go before. This is an important work of history and a revelation for anyone who ever wondered what it means to be "made" in the mob.<br><p><b>John Dickie</b> is a historian and journalist. He lectures in Italian Studies at University College London and has written on many aspects of Italian life.</p></p><h2>The Farming of Bones</h2><p><p>It is 1937 and Amabelle D�sir, a young Haitian woman living in the Dominican Republic, has built herself a life as the servant and companion of the wife of a wealthy colonel. She and Sebastien, a cane worker, are deeply in love and plan to marry. But Amabelle's &nbsp;world collapses when a wave of genocidal violence, driven by Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, leads to the slaughter of Haitian workers. Amabelle and Sebastien are separated, and she desperately flees the tide of violence for a Haiti she barely remembers.<br><br> Already acknowledged as a classic, this harrowing story of love and survival&#x2014;from one of the most important voices of her generation&#x2014;is an unforgettable memorial to the victims of the Parsley Massacre and a testimony to the power of human memory.</p></p><p>In a 1930s Dominican Republic village, the scream of a woman in labor rings out like the shot heard around Hispaniola. Every detail of the birth scene--the balance of power between the middle-aged Se�ora and her Haitian maid, the babies' skin color, not to mention which child is to survive--reverberates throughout Edwidge Danticat's <i>Farming of Bones</i>. In fact, rather than a celebration of fecundity, the unexpected double delivery gels into a metaphor for the military-sponsored mass murder of Haitian emigrants. As the Se�ora's doctor explains: "Many of us start out as twins in the belly and do away with the other." <p> But Danticat's powerful second novel is far from a currently modish victimization saga, and can hold its own with such modern classics as <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> and <i>The Color Purple</i>. Its watchful narrator, the Se�ora's shy Haitian housemaid, describes herself as "one of those sea stones that sucks its colors inside and loses its translucence once it's taken out into the sun." An astute observer of human character, Amabelle D�sir is also a conduit for the author's tart, poetic prose. Her lover, Sebastian, has "arms as wide as one of my bare thighs," while the Se�ora's complicit officer husband is "still shorter than the average man, even in his military boots."</p><p> The orphaned Amabelle comes to assume almost messianic proportions, but she is entirely fictional, as is the town of Alegr�a where the tale begins. The genocide and exodus, however, are factual. Indeed, the atrocities committed by Dominican president Rafael Trujillo's army back in 1937 rival those of Duvalier's Touton Macoutes. History has rendered Trujillo's carnage much less visible than Duvalier's, but no less painful. As Amabelle's father once told her, "Misery won't touch you gentle. It always leaves its thumbprints on you; sometimes it leaves them for others to see, sometimes for nobody but you to know of." Thanks to Danticat's stellar novel, the world will now know. <i>--Jean Lenihan</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Willpower Doesn&#39;t Work: Discover the Hidden Keys to Success</h2><p>We rely on willpower to create change in our lives...but what if we're thinking about it all wrong?

But everything changed when the United States went to war with Japan in 1941 and the government forced all people of Japanese ancestry to leave their homes on the West Coast and move to distant prison camps. This included Fred, whose parents had immigrated to the United States from Japan many years before. But Fred refused to go. He knew that what the government was doing was unfair. And when he got put in jail for resisting, he knew he couldn't give up.<p>Inspired by the award-winning book for adults <i>Wherever There's a Fight</i>, the Fighting for Justice series introduces young readers to real-life heroes and heroines of social progress. The story of Fred Korematsu's fight against discrimination explores the life of one courageous person who made the United States a fairer place for all Americans, and it encourages all of us to speak up for justice.</p></p><p>Laura Atkins is an author, teacher, and independent children&#x2019;s book editor with over twenty years of editorial experience.

They divide their time between Georgia and South Africa.The Secret of Adoration<br><br>Why are so many Christians reluctant to spend time in prayer? If, on the human level, spending time in the company of a parent is normally something quite natural and enjoyable for a child, what is it that hinders God&#x2019;s children from doing the same with their heavenly Father?<br><br>One answer could be that we are too focused on our human limitations, on our own meekness and sinfulness, and not<br>enough on God&#x2019;s greatness, holiness, love, and omnipotence. The thoughts and feelings that fill our hearts and minds influence our prayers.<br><br>If we dwell upon our own needs and desires, our own efforts, and our own faith, we shall soon find that there is no real power in our prayers. It is essential that we see prayer in the light of God: the deep interest He takes in us, the great love with which He desires to answer prayer, the omnipotence of His power, and the magnitude of His strengthening grace. As with all else, in prayer God must be first. Prayer, to be effective, needs to first be approached in the light of heaven and the infinite glory of the living God. It is when, by this marvelous grace, we have been lifted up into His fellowship and love that He bestows upon us the blessings we need. The first thing, then, must be to bow in lowly reverence before God, offering Him our adoration and worship.<br><br>We need to take time to adore God and to secure some sense of His presence. Give God time to reveal Himself to you. Then adore Him. God is in the temple: Let all who appear before Him do so in awe. Prostrate yourself before Him with deepest reverence. Own Him alone as your God and Savior, and praise His name forever.<br><br>True Worship<br><br>Worship God!<br>Revelations 22:9<br><br>What might be the reason that prayer is not for us a greater joy and delight? How can we bring down the power and the blessing on those for whom we pray?<br><br>The primary answer is undoubtedly that our experience of the presence of God is too limited. When we pray, we do not seek after His presence with all our hearts. We think mostly of our need, our weakness, our desire, our prayer. We forget that in every prayer God must be first and foremost. To seek Him, to find Him, to linger in His presence, is the approach that gives prayer its inspiration. How then can you acquire an intimate experience of the presence of God in your communion with Him? The answer is quite simple:<br><br>Believe with your whole heart that He offers Himself as the listener. Give God the opportunity to make Himself known to you when you approach Him in prayer. You will never discover this, however, if you do not take time to have<br>genuine fellowship with God. The power of prayer does not lie in the number or earnestness of the words you use, but in a living faith that God Himself accepts both you and your prayer into His loving heart.<br><br>It is the goal of this month&#x2019;s readings to help you to meet with God every time you pray. Each day you will be given one or more texts, with which you can bow before God in adoration, waiting for Him to lead you into a real experience of their truth and power. Therefore, begin the day with the desire, &#x201c;My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?&#x201d; (Psalm 42:2).</p><h2>Baltimore Catechism Two</h2><p>The 37 lessons contained in Baltimore Catechism No. 2 present the fundamentals of the Catholic Faith in a manner suitable for sixth through ninth graders and those preparing for Confirmation. <br><br> Since its 1885 debut, the Catechism commissioned by the Third Council of Bishops in Baltimore has instructed generations of Catholic faithful. <br><br> With an easy to read question and answer format, the Catechism combines solid Catholic doctrinal teaching with meaningful exposure to Scripture and practical application. <br><br> The revival of interest in the Baltimore Catechism reflects Catholics growing realization that a clear, concise presentation of the truths of the Faith is just what people young and old need to appreciate, practice and defend Church teaching. Catechists and parents will find this Catechism an invaluable teaching tool as they prepare children and catechumens to receive the Sacraments and lead authentic Catholic lives. Students will find this an uncomplicated and friendly guide to authentic Catholicism. <br><br> This is the original TAN edition of the Baltimore Catechism, with updated typesetting, fresh new cover, larger format, quality binding and the same trusted content.</p><p>The Third Plenary Council of Baltimore was an American assembly held in the nineteenth century. Presiding were Archbishop Gibbons, the Apostolic Delegate, in addition to thirteen other archbishops, sixty-one bishops or their representatives, six abbots, and a religious general. Its sessions were held from the ninth of November to the seventh of December, 1884, and were comprised of twelve decrees. The Third Council is most noteworthy for the vigorous Catholic school building campaign which it spawned, commanding all parishes to provide Catholic education. It also produced the popular <i>Baltimore Catechism</i> for schoolchildren.<br></p><h2>The Qur&#39;an: English translation and Parallel Arabic text</h2><p>One of the most influential books in the history of literature, recognized as the greatest literary masterpiece in Arabic, the Qur'an is the supreme authority and living source of all Islamic teaching, the sacred text that sets out the creed, rituals, ethics, and laws of Islam. First published in 2004, M. A. S. Abdel Haleem's superb English translation has been acclaimed for both its faithfulness to the original and its supreme clarity. Now Haleem's translation is published side-by-side with the original Arabic text, to give readers a greater appreciation and understanding of the holy book.<br><br>Revised for the new edition, this translation is written in contemporary language that remains true to the meaning and spirit of the original, making the text crystal clear while retaining all of this great work's eloquence. It is now set page-for-page against the most widespread traditional calligraphic Arabic text, for the benefit of Muslims who wish to make the connection between the translation and the Arabic text, as well as Arabic readers and non-Arabs learning to read the Qur'an in Arabic. As in the original volume, the translation is completely free from the archaisms, incoherence, and alien structures that mar other translations. Furthermore, Haleem includes notes that explain geographical, historical, and personal allusions as well as an index in which Qur'anic material is arranged into topics for easy reference. His introduction traces the history of the Qur'an, examines its structure and stylistic features, and considers issues related to militancy, intolerance, and the subjection of women. <br><br>This brilliant bilingual edition of the Qur'an is the best available English-language translation. It has been approved by Al-Azhar University, the oldest Muslim university and the world's leading institution for the study of Arabic and Islam.<br></p><p><br><strong>M. A. S.

Unexplainable messes. Food all over the kitchen floor. Who could the culprits be? Dinosaurs! Boasting bright and hilarious photographs, along with a story written from the point of view of an older, wiser sibling, Refe and Susan Tuma's picture book documents a very messy adventure that shows just what the dinosaurs did last night.<br><br><br></p><p><b>Refe </b>and <b>Susan Tuma</b> live in Kansas City with their four children and a herd of plastic dinosaurs. The Tumas began cataloguing their dinosaurs' antics in 2012, igniting the imaginations of hundreds of thousands of children--young and old--across the world.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Filled with whimsy and imagination, this book will delight children of all ages as a group of rogue dinosaurs seek misadventure, since they "aren't very good at following the rules." Reminiscent of the humor and themes (toys come alive when children go to sleep) from the movie Toy Story, this picture book comes alive with bold action. In an authors' note, the Tumas detail the origins of the work and how they decided to document their children's dinosaur toys as they came to life each night. This book is a collection of photographs inspired from their Dinovember collections on social media. Scenes range from mud-filled messes, art inspired graffiti as "sometimes they go too far" and spray paint each other to images of the dinos playing in the laundry room, where the authors' warn that "dinosaurs are dry clean only." Detailed photographs will keep kids turning the pages and parents enjoying the rockling dino antics.

She wasn&#x2019;t just a friendly mutt who needed a home. Soon she was trying to use the strange ideas of quantum mechanics for the really important things in her life: chasing critters, getting treats, and going for walks. She peppered Chad with questions: Could she use quantum tunneling to get through the neighbor&#x2019;s fence and chase bunnies? What about quantum teleportation to catch squirrels before they climb out of reach? Where are all the universes in which Chad drops steak on the floor? <br><br>With great humor and clarity, Chad Orzel explains to Emmy, and to human readers, just what quantum mechanics is and how it works&#x2014;and why, although you can&#x2019;t use it to catch squirrels or eat steak, it&#x2019;s still bizarre, amazing, and important to every dog and human.</p><p>Chad Orzel was born and raised in central New York, and received a degree in physics from Williams College, and his Ph.D. in chemical physics from the University of Maryland. He is now a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Union College in Schenectady, New York. He lives near campus with his wife Kate, their daughter, and, of course, Emmy, the Queen of Niskayuna.<b><b>INTRODUCTION<br>Why Talk to Your Dog about Physics?<br>An Introduction to Quantum Physics</b></b> <p>The Mohawk-Hudson Humane Society has set up a little path through the woods near their facility outside Troy, so you can take a walk with a dog you&#x2019;re thinking of adopting. There&#x2019;s a bench on the side of the path in a small clearing, and I sit down to look at the dog I&#x2019;ve taken out. </p><p>She sits down next to the bench, and pokes my hand with her nose, so I scratch behind her ears. My wife and I have looked at a bunch of dogs together, but Kate had to work, so I&#x2019;ve been dispatched to pick out a dog by myself. This one seems like a good fit. </p><p>She&#x2019;s a year-old mixed-breed dog, German shepherd and something else. She&#x2019;s got the classic shepherd black and tan coloring, but she&#x2019;s small for a shepherd, and has floppy ears. The tag on her kennel door gave her name as &#x201c;Princess,&#x201d; but that doesn&#x2019;t seem appropriate. </p><p>&#x201c;What do you think, girl?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;What should we call you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Call me Emmy!&#x201d; she says. </p><p>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s my name, silly.&#x201d; </p><p>Being called &#x201c;silly&#x201d; by a dog is a little surprising, but I guess she has a point. &#x201c;Okay, I can&#x2019;t argue with that. So, do you want to come live with us?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, that depends,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the critter situation like?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Beg pardon?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I like to chase things. Will there be critters for me to chase?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, yeah. We&#x2019;ve got a good-sized yard, and there are lots of birds and squirrels, and the occasional rabbit.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Ooooh! I like bunnies!&#x201d; She wags her tail happily. &#x201c;How about walks? Will I get walks?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And treats? I like treats.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get treats if you&#x2019;re a good dog.&#x201d; </p><p>She looks faintly offended. &#x201c;I am a <i>very</i> good dog. You <i>will</i> give me treats. What do you do for a living?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What? Who&#x2019;s evaluating who, here?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I need to know if you deserve a dog as good as me.&#x201d; The name &#x201c;Princess&#x201d; may have been more apt than I thought. &#x201c;What do you do for a living?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, my wife, Kate, is a lawyer, and I&#x2019;m a professor of physics at Union College, over in Schenectady. I teach and do research in atomic physics and quantum optics.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quantum what?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quantum optics. Broadly defined, it&#x2019;s the study of the interaction between light and atoms in situations where you have to describe one or both of them using quantum physics.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That sounds complicated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It is, but it&#x2019;s fascinating stuff. Quantum physics has all sorts of weird and wonderful properties. Particles behave like waves, and waves behave like particles. Particle properties are indeterminate until you measure them. Empty space is full of &#x2018;virtual particles&#x2019; popping in and out of existence. It&#x2019;s really cool.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hmmm.&#x201d; She looks thoughtful, then says, &#x201c;One last test.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rub my belly.&#x201d; She flops over on her back, and I reach down to rub her belly. After a minute of that, she stands up, shakes herself off, and says &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;re pretty good. Let&#x2019;s go home.&#x201d; </p><p>We head back to the kennel to fill out the adoption paperwork. As we&#x2019;re walking, she says, &#x201c;Quantum physics, huh? I&#x2019;ll have to learn something about that.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d be happy to explain it to you sometime.&#x201d; </p><p>Like most dog owners, I spend a lot of time talking to my dog. Most of our conversations are fairly typical&#x2014;don&#x2019;t eat that, don&#x2019;t climb on the furniture, let&#x2019;s go for a walk. Some of our conversations, though, are about quantum physics. </p><p>Why do I talk to my dog about quantum physics? Well, it&#x2019;s what I do for a living: I&#x2019;m a college physics professor. As a result, I spend a lot of time thinking about quantum physics. </p><p>What is quantum physics? Quantum physics is one part of &#x201c;modern physics,&#x201d; meaning physics based on laws discovered after about 1900. Laws and principles of physics that were developed before about 1900 are considered &#x201c;classical&#x201d; physics. </p><p>Classical physics is the physics of everyday objects&#x2014;tennis balls and squeaky toys, stoves and ice cubes, magnets and electrical wiring. Classical laws of motion govern the motion of anything large enough to see with the naked eye. Classical thermodynamics explains the physics of heating and cooling objects, and the operation of engines and refrigerators. Classical electromagnetism explains the behavior of lightbulbs, radios, and magnets. </p><p>Modern physics describes the stranger world that we see when we go beyond the everyday. This world was first revealed in experiments done in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which cannot be explained with classical laws of physics. New fields with different rules needed to be developed. </p><p>Modern physics is divided into two parts, each representing a radical departure from classical rules. One part, relativity, deals with objects that move very fast, or are in the presence of strong gravitational forces. Albert Einstein introduced relativity in 1905, and it&#x2019;s a fascinating subject in its own right, but beyond the scope of this book. </p><p>The other part of modern physics is what I talk to my dog about. Quantum physics or quantum mechanics* is the name given to the part of modern physics dealing with light and things that are very small&#x2014;molecules, single atoms, subatomic particles. Max Planck coined the word &#x201c;quantum&#x201d; in 1900, and Einstein won the Nobel Prize for presenting the first quantum theory of light.&#x2020; The full theory of quantum mechanics was developed over the next thirty years or so. </p><p>The people who made the theory, from early pioneers like Planck and Niels Bohr, who made the first quantum model of the hydrogen atom, to later visionaries like Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger, who each independently worked out what we now call &#x201c;quantum electrodynamics&#x201d; (QED), are rightly regarded as titans of physics. Some elements of quantum theory have even escaped the realm of physics and captured the popular imagination, like Werner Heisenberg&#x2019;s uncertainty principle, Erwin Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat paradox, and the parallel universes of Hugh Everett&#x2019;s many-worlds interpretation. </p><p>Modern life would be impossible without quantum mechanics. Without an understanding of the quantum nature of the electron, it would be impossible to make the semiconductor chips that run our computers. Without an understanding of the quantum nature of light and atoms, it would be impossible to make the lasers we use to send messages over fiber-optic communication lines. </p><p>Quantum theory&#x2019;s effect on science goes beyond the merely practical&#x2014;it forces physicists to grapple with issues of philosophy. Quantum physics places limits on what we can know about the universe and the properties of objects in it. Quantum mechanics even changes our understanding of what it means to make a measurement. It requires a complete rethinking of the nature of reality at the most fundamental level. </p><p>Quantum mechanics describes an utterly bizarre world, where nothing is certain and objects don&#x2019;t have definite properties until you measure them. It&#x2019;s a world where distant objects are connected in strange ways, where there are entire universes with different histories right next to our own, and where &#x201c;virtual particles&#x201d; pop in and out of existence in otherwise empty space. </p><p>Quantum physics may sound like the stuff of fantasy fiction, but it&#x2019;s science. The world described in quantum theory is our world, at a microscopic scale.* The strange effects predicted by quantum physics are real, with real consequences and applications. Quantum theory has been tested to an incredible level of precision, making it the most accurately tested theory in the history of scientific theories. Even its strangest predictions have been verified experimentally (as we&#x2019;ll see in chapters 7, 8, and 9). </p><p>So, quantum physics is neat stuff. But what does it have to do with dogs? </p><p>Dogs come to quantum physics in a better position than most humans. They approach the world with fewer preconceptions than humans, and always expect the unexpected. A dog can walk down the same street every day for a year, and it will be a new experience every day. Every rock, every bush, every tree will be sniffed as if it had never been sniffed before. </p><p>If dog treats appeared out of empty space in the middle of a kitchen, a human would freak out, but a dog would take it in stride. Indeed, for most dogs, the spontaneous generation of treats would be vindication&#x2014;they always expect treats to appear at any moment, for no obvious reason. </p><p>Quantum mechanics seems baffling and troubling to humans because it confounds our commonsense expectations about how the world works. Dogs are a much more receptive audience. The everyday world is a strange and marvelous place to a dog, and the predictions of quantum theory are no stranger or more marvelous than, say, the operation of a doorknob.* </p><p>Discussing quantum physics with my dog is useful because it helps me see how to discuss quantum mechanics with humans. Part of learning quantum mechanics is learning to think like a dog. If you can look at the world the way a dog does, as an endless source of surprise and wonder, then quantum mechanics will seem a lot more approachable. </p><p>This book reproduces a series of conversations with my dog about quantum physics. Each conversation is followed by a detailed discussion of the physics involved, aimed at interested human readers. The topics range from ideas many people have heard of, like particle-wave duality (chapter 1) and the uncertainty pr...</p></p><h2>The Accident: A chilling psychological thriller</h2><p><b><i>If only she'd said no...</i></b> <br><br><b>Katherine</b> knew she&#x2019;d had too many drinks, but they were only going a short distance.

There, in shimmering glory, was a beautiful woman draped in gold jewelry, looking satisfied and happy. Across the pages in bold lettering were the words: &#x201c;The Gold Shivers.&#x201d; I felt both amused and appalled as I read the pitch:<br><br>From the First Small Shiver<br><br>when a Shimmering Necklace of Gold Beads Catches a Woman&#x2019;s Eye.<br><br>To the Great Shivers of Delight<br><br>when the Coveted Object Actually Becomes Hers . . .<br><br>Among Life&#x2019;s Pleasures, Count this Deeply Held Euphoria as Unique.<br><br>The Only Way to Get the Gold Shivers is by Getting the Gold.<br><br>Because we&#x2019;re bombarded with thousands of marketing messages like this every day, it&#x2019;s easy to think that gratifying our desires is the way to find happiness. We might even know, as one bumper sticker says, &#x201c;The best things in life are not things,&#x201d; but we can still believe that something else out there will make us happy. When I find my soul mate, or when I write the great American novel, or when I retir . . .<br><br>There&#x2019;s no denying the hit of pleasure we feel when we fulfill a desire for a particular experience or object or goal. But how long does the satisfaction last once we receive the &#x201c;coveted object&#x201d;? Perhaps until we notice there&#x2019;s something else we want. When we equate true happiness with getting something (or someone), we can end up like hamsters in an exercise wheel&#x2014;running but never arriving.<br><br>If genuine happiness is not based on objects or experience, where can it be found? And how? Like following a road map, once you know where you&#x2019;re going, it&#x2019;s easier to figure out how to get there.<br><br>TAKING THE FIRST STEP<br><br>The journey of awakening joy begins with setting a clear intention. Although we all want to be happy, most of us don&#x2019;t place an explicit wish for that at the center of our lives. We think if we are successful, rich, or liked by others, happiness will come. We tend to hope that achieving certain goals in the future will make us happy. But these are roundabout ways to get to happiness, and they don&#x2019;t necessarily work. What does get you there is starting where you are and discovering what you are looking for in the midst of your current life.<br><br>You might think that the circumstances of your life will have to change a lot before you can find happiness in the midst of them. While it&#x2019;s true that our well-being is affected by how we live, we also know that even in the best of circumstances we can be unhappy. And sometimes in very challenging situations, we can feel surprisingly at ease. While this book will encourage you to bring experiences and circumstances into your life that contribute to your well-being, the key factor is deciding to change your mind. As my colleague Sylvia Boorstein puts it, &#x201c;Happiness is an inside job.&#x201d; When we consciously intend to be happy, actually saying that intention aloud or to ourselves, we set in motion a radical transformation. Profound changes begin to take place inside us, in our body and our mind. The momentum of positive change grows as we learn to choose actions and situations that align us with our intention.<br><br>THE GOLD OF TRUE HAPPINESS<br><br>I was a gloomy existentialist in college until one day it struck me that I actually wanted to be happy. I believed the only way to achieve that was to get and to do what I wanted. My personal strategy to ensure happiness was trying to string together enough moments of pleasure and gratification that the underlying unease couldn&#x2019;t get through. Getting the latest album of cool music felt good&#x2014;for a little while. Having fun at a wild party was exhilarating&#x2014;at the time. But no matter how many happy moments I had, I still didn&#x2019;t feel any closer to being a &#x201c;happy person.&#x201d; I felt like I was on a roller coaster, and the ride down seemed to last a lot longer than the occasional trip up. There had to be another way.<br><br>That was what led me in 1974 to Naropa Institute, a kind of spiritual summer camp, in Boulder, Colorado. I&#x2019;d read some books on Eastern philosophy that made me question a lot of my assumptions, and I wanted to check things out for myself. When I walked into meditation class that first day, I was excited about the promise of an exotic new teaching. There in the front of the room a man was sitting cross- legged&#x2014;but he didn&#x2019;t at all fit my image of the great spiritual guru I was expecting to see. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t seem very different from me. He was Jewish and sounded like he was from New York, and I wondered if this guy could really tell me something new. But after spending the first ten minutes of the lecture judging the package, I decided to start listening to what he was saying.<br><br>Within moments it was clear that Joseph Goldstein understood something about genuine freedom and happiness and how to get there. I saw for the first time the possibility of not being a slave to my neurotic thoughts and fears. By the end of the class, I knew I had found a sure road to happiness, and I was determined to follow it.<br><br>Joseph talked a lot about one of the basic teachings of the Buddha&#x2014; the recognition that everything we experience in life is impermanent. No matter how good things are, they will change. Well, that&#x2019;s for sure, I thought. That&#x2019;s the story of my life. We don&#x2019;t get what we want and feel frustrated. We get what we don&#x2019;t want and feel upset. Or we get what we want and then find out it doesn&#x2019;t quite satisfy us in the way we thought it would. We find that the pleasure of the gold shivers lasts for a few moments, then fades away. As those famous &#x201c;philosophers,&#x201d; the Rolling Stones, so profoundly put it: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get no satisfaction.&#x201d;<br><br>Because everything changes, no circumstance, experience, or object can give us lasting happiness. Our bodies change, our minds change, the seasons change. Yet we try to hold on to pleasure, youth, summertime, happiness. As Joseph puts it, trying to hold on to anything in an ever-changing reality is like holding tight to a rope you&#x2019;re sliding down. All you get is rope burn. And the more you hold on, the more you suffer.<br><br>What is the way out of this predicament? Awakening joy isn&#x2019;t about fulfilling goals or changing particular circumstances. It&#x2019;s about training the mind and heart to live in a way that allows us to be truly happy with our life as it is right now. Not that we stop aspiring to grow and change in positive ways, or that we remain in harmful situations, but we begin to find the joy inside us right where we are. As you work with the practices offered here, you will discover that happiness is not a place you arrive at but rather the result of training your mind to ride with ease and flexibility the roller coaster of life.<br><br>DECIDING TO BE HAPPY<br><br>Vickie was hoping for a miracle. For five years she had been living with chronic pain, unrelieved by anything doctors and healers had been able to offer. By the time we spoke, her disappointment had spiraled down into severe bouts of depression. &#x201c;Often I break down and cry just from trying to get through the day,&#x201d; she told me. Vickie had come to talk about whether or not she should enroll in an Awakening Joy course. &#x201c;But I just can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s possible for me to be happy,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Recently her situation had gotten even harder. Friends who had been trying to help for years had begun to drift away, afraid of being pulled into the black hole of Vickie&#x2019;s despair. &#x201c;And my boyfriend has real doubts about our future,&#x201d; she said through tears. &#x201c;I know he loves me and feels a lot of compassion for me, but he says he wonders if I haven&#x2019;t given up on life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going through so much, Vickie,&#x201d; I said softly. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve seen other people going through really hard times make major changes when they decide to. I think you can do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Despite her doubts, Vickie decided to enroll in the course. The very first meeting of the group proved to be a critical turning point for her. As usual I opened the course by asking participants to get in touch with their intention to bring more happiness into their lives. The evening was spent exploring this uplifting prospect, and by the time the class ended, the room was filled with enthusiasm and promise. Some participants lingered to talk with friends, and others came up to ask questions or make comments. I noticed Vickie sitting quietly at the side of the room, and when the others had left, I went over to see if she was okay.<br><br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see how this will work for me, given my physical condition,&#x201d; she began. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even conceive of what it would be like to be joyful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand how you can feel that way,&#x201d; I said, taking a seat next to her. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t try to be any different from how you are at this moment. But I think the most important ingredient in changing your situation is letting yourself open to the possibility of finding joy in your life. That needs to happen before you can get clear on your intention.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew there had to be a way to help her realize she had the capacity to enjoy her life. I had seen so many people, including myself, turn their lives around once they had embraced that possibility.<br><br>&#x201c;Vickie, are there ever any moments in your life when you&#x2019;re enjoying something?&#x201d; I asked her.<br><br>She replied, a little hesitantly, &#x201c;Yes . . .when I play with my three-year-old niece.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you right now bring to mind an image of playing with your niece?&#x201d;<br><br>Vickie settled into her chair and closed her eyes. Almost immediately a tiny smile appeared.<br><br>&#x201c;Now just stay with that image and those feelings for a few moments,&#x201d; I suggested. I could see a subtle change pass over her face as she sat there in silence. When I asked her to describe what she was feeling, it took her a while to find the words.<br><br>&#x201c;I feel a kind of tingling throughout my body . . .a lightness in my mind . . .my heart feels warm . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, good. Now let yourself breathe in that feeling, allowing it to deepen with each breath,&#x201d; I suggested, knowing that letting the experience fully register in her body and mind was a key to making the shift she wanted.<br><br>&#x201c;Now project your mind forward in time and imagine that you&#x2019;ve practiced accessing this feeling of well-being regularly during the next ten months of the course. Can you tell me what your life would look like then?&#x201d;<br><br>I could see Vickie&#x2019;s body relax as she reflected.<br><br>&#x201c;I have less stress . . .I enjoy being with my friends again . . .I see myself taking more walks in nature, and letting myself have more fun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. If this feels worth going for,&#x201d; I said softly, &#x201c;take your time to get in touch with your intention to make it happen. See if you can decide that you&#x2019;ll do your part to bring it about.&#x201d;<br><br>As she silently contemplated that suggestion, it looked to me as if Vickie&#x2019;s body actually grew lighter. When she finally opened her eyes, the smile she gave me was genuine and bright. &#x201c;That was amazing,&#x201d; she offered. &#x201c;Something in me said not only can I do this but I&#x2019;m going to do this.&#x201d; That decision began a process within her that would eventually look like the miracle she had longed for. As the saying goes, &#x201c;God helps those who help themselves,&#x201d; and Vickie&#x2019;s &#x201c;miracle&#x201d; was actually set in motion when she was willing to open to the possibility of joy.<br><br>FINDING THE &#x201c;MAGIC&#x201d; WORDS<br><br>FOR YOUR INTENTION<br><br>As Vickie found, setting the intention to awaken joy works best once you&#x2019;ve recalled your capacity to be happy. Trusting that knowledge, you can make the heartfelt decision to do your part to make that happen. This is the heart of setting your intention to be happy&#x2014;your determination to do what you can to fulfill your vision.<br><br>Finding a phrase that encapsulates your intention is a useful way to remind yourself of your direction. You might say something like &#x201c;I intend to allow more joy into my life,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I want to experience more happiness each day,&#x201d; or &#x201c;May I live with a greater sense of well- being.&#x201d; The exact way you phrase your intention doesn&#x2019;t matter, and the wording may change over time. What&#x2019;s most important is to begin.<br><br>Joan wrote from Canada about the struggle she got into when she tried to find the perfect way to state her intention. She had joined the Awakening Joy course in order to find more joy in her relationships with her husband and two children. &#x201c;I keep falling into knee-jerk reactions such as irritation and negativity with them,&#x201d; she wrote. Because the change she was looking for felt so important, Joan wanted the phrase she used to state her intention to be exactly right.<br><br>After several frustrating days of trying out various possibilities, she decided to just sit quietly and see what came. The words that arose were &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give joy a shot.&#x201d; Not at all the profound phrase she was looking for! &#x201c;I felt almost repulsed by the words and dismissed them,&#x201d; she wrote. But the phrase kept coming back. At some point Joan realized, &#x201c;I can just be silly with the intention and stop worrying about the &#x2018;right&#x2019; words. Instead I can try to stay connected with the raw energy behind these &#x2018;silly&#x2019; words and go for it!&#x201d;<br><br>A GAME OF REMINDERS<br><br>The more you do something, the easier it gets. The more often you remind yourself that you are actually intending to bring more feelings of joy and well-being into your life, the more you will be open to them when they arise. And when you remain aware of your intention to grow in happiness, you&#x2019;re more likely to make choices to support it.</p><h2>Trees of North America: A Guide to Field Identification, Revised and Updated (Golden Field Guide from St. Martin&#39;s Press)</h2><p><p>Smell the bark of the aromatic Sassafras.

Please visit JamieMcGuire.com.Beautiful Oblivion <br> <br>CHAPTER ONE<br> <br>His words hung there, in the darkness between our voices. I sometimes found comfort in that space, but in three months, I&#x2019;d only found unrest. That space became more like a convenient place to hide. Not for me, for him. My fingers ached, so I allowed them to relax, not realizing how hard I&#x2019;d been gripping my cell phone.<br> <br>My roommate, Raegan, was sitting next to my open suitcase on the bed, her legs crisscrossed. Whatever look was on my face prompted her to take my hand. T.J.? she mouthed.<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you please say something?&#x201d; T.J. asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want me to say? I&#x2019;m packed. I took vacation time. Hank has already given Jorie my shifts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel like a huge asshole. I wish I didn&#x2019;t have to go, but I warned you. When I have an ongoing project, I can be called out at any time. If you need help with rent or anything . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want your money,&#x201d; I said, rubbing my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought this would be a good weekend. I swear to God I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d be getting on a plane tomorrow morning, and instead you&#x2019;re calling me to say I can&#x2019;t come. Again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know this seems like a dick move. I swear to you I told them I had important plans. But when things come up, Cami . . . I have to do my job.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wiped a tear from my cheek, but I refused to let him hear me cry. I kept the trembling from my voice. &#x201c;Are you coming home for Thanksgiving, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighed. &#x201c;I want to. But I don&#x2019;t know if I can. It depends on if this is wrapped up. I do miss you. A lot. I don&#x2019;t like this, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will your schedule ever get better?&#x201d; I asked. It took him longer than it should to answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if I said probably not?&#x201d;<br> <br>I lifted my eyebrows. I expected that answer but didn&#x2019;t expect him to be so . . . truthful.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. I imagined him cringing. &#x201c;I just pulled into the airport. I have to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, okay. Talk to you later.&#x201d; I forced my voice to stay level. I didn&#x2019;t want to sound upset. I didn&#x2019;t want him to think I was weak or emotional. He was strong, and self-reliant, and did what had to be done without complaint. I tried to be that for him. Whining about something out of his control wouldn&#x2019;t help anything.<br> <br>He sighed again. &#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t believe me, but I do love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; I said, and I meant it.<br> <br>I pressed the red button on the screen and let my phone fall to the bed.<br> <br>Raegan was already in damage control mode. &#x201c;He was called into work?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, well, maybe you guys will just have to be more spontaneous. Maybe you can just show up, and if he&#x2019;s called out while you&#x2019;re there, you wait on him. When he gets back, you pick up where you left off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> <br>She squeezed my hand. &#x201c;Or maybe he&#x2019;s a tool who should stop choosing his job over you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s worked really hard for this position.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know what position it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you. He&#x2019;s utilizing his degree. He specializes in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, whatever that means.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shot me a dubious look. &#x201c;Yeah, you also told me to keep it all a secret. Which makes me think he&#x2019;s not being completely honest with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood up and dumped out my suitcase, letting all the contents spill onto my comforter. Usually I only made my bed when I was packing, so I could now see the comforter&#x2019;s light-blue fabric with a few navy-blue octopus tentacles reaching across it. T.J. hated it, but it made me feel like I was being hugged while I slept. My room was made up of strange, random things, but then, so was I.<br> <br>Raegan rummaged through the pile of clothes, and held up a black top with the shoulders and front strategically ripped. &#x201c;We both have the night off. We should go out. Get drinks served to us for once.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grabbed the shirt from her hands and inspected it while I mulled over Raegan&#x2019;s suggestion. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. We should. Are we taking your car, or the Smurf?&#x201d;<br> <br>Raegan shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost on empty and we don&#x2019;t get paid until tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like it&#x2019;s the Smurf, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a crash session in the bathroom, Raegan and I jumped up into my light-blue, modified CJ Jeep. It wasn&#x2019;t in the best of shape, but at one time someone had had enough vision and love to mold it into a Jeep/truck hybrid. The spoiled college dropout who owned the Smurf between that owner and me didn&#x2019;t love it as much. The seat cushions were exposed in some places where the black leather seats were torn, the carpet had cigarette holes and stains, and the hard top needed to be replaced, but that neglect meant that I could pay for it in full, and a payment-free vehicle was the best kind to own.<br> <br>I buckled my seat belt, and stabbed the key into the ignition.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should I pray?&#x201d; Raegan asked.<br> <br>I turned the key, and the Smurf made a sickly whirring noise. The engine sputtered, and then purred, and we both clapped. My parents raised four children on a factory worker&#x2019;s salary. I never asked them to help me buy a car, instead I got a job at the local ice cream shop when I was fifteen, and saved $557.11. The Smurf wasn&#x2019;t the vehicle I dreamed about when I was little, but 550 bucks bought me an independence, and that was priceless.<br> <br>Twenty minutes later, Raegan and I were on the opposite side of town, strutting across the gravel lot of the Red Door, slowly and in unison, as if we were being filmed while walking to a bad�ass soundtrack.<br> <br>Kody was standing at the entrance, his huge arms probably the same size as my head. He eyed us as we approached. &#x201c;IDs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fuck off!&#x201d; Raegan snarled. &#x201c;We work here. You know how old we are.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Still have to see IDs.&#x201d;<br> <br>I frowned at Raegan, and she rolled her eyes, digging into her back pocket. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t know how old I am at this point, we have issues.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Raegan. Quit busting my balls and let me see the damn thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The last time I let you see something you didn&#x2019;t call me for three days.&#x201d;<br> <br>He cringed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never going to get over that, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She tossed her ID at Kody and he slapped it against his chest. He glanced at it, and then handed it back, looking at me expectantly. I handed him my driver&#x2019;s license.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thought you were leaving town?&#x201d; he asked, glancing down before returning the thin plastic card to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Long story,&#x201d; I said, stuffing my license into my back pocket. My jeans were so tight I was amazed I could fit anything besides my ass back there.<br> <br>Kody opened the oversize red door, and Raegan smiled sweetly. &#x201c;Thanks, baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Love you. Be good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m always good,&#x201d; she said, winking.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you when I get off work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; She pulled me through the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are the weirdest couple,&#x201d; I said over the bass. It was buzzing in my chest, and I was fairly certain every beat made my bones shake.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Raegan said again.<br> <br>The dance floor was already packed with sweaty, drunk college kids. The fall semester was in full swing. Raegan walked over to the bar and stood at the end. Jorie winked at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want me to clear you out some seats?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>Raegan shook her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just offering because you want my tips from last night!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jorie laughed. Her long, platinum blond hair fell in loose waves past her shoulders, with a few black peekaboo strands. She wore a black minidress and combat boots, and was pushing buttons on the cash register to ring someone up while she talked to us. We had all learned to multitask and move like every tip was a hundred-dollar bill. If you could bartend fast enough, you stood a chance of working the east bar, and the tips made there could pay a month&#x2019;s worth of bills in a weekend.<br> <br>That was where I&#x2019;d been tending bar for a year, placed just three months after I was hired at the Red Door. Raegan worked right beside me, and together we kept that machine greased like a stripper in a plastic pool full of baby oil. Jorie and the other bartender, Blia, worked the south bar at the entrance. It was basically a kiosk, and they loved it when Raegan or I were out of town.<br> <br>&#x201c;So? What are you drinking?&#x201d; Jorie asked.<br> <br>Raegan looked at me, and then back at Jorie. &#x201c;Whiskey sours.&#x201d;<br> <br>I made a face. &#x201c;Minus the sour, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Once Jorie passed us our drinks, Raegan and I found an empty table and sat, shocked at our luck. Weekends were always packed, and an open table at ten thirty wasn&#x2019;t common.<br> <br>I held a brand-new pack of cigarettes in my hand and hit the end of it against my palm to pack them, then tore off the plastic, flipping the top. Even though the Red was so smoky that just sitting there made me feel like I was smoking an entire pack of cigarettes, it was nice to sit at a table and relax. When I was working, I usually had time for one drag and the rest burned away, unsmoked.<br> <br>Raegan watched me light it. &#x201c;I want one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I do!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t smoked in two months, Raegan. You&#x2019;ll blame me tomorrow for ruining your streak.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gestured at the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m smoking! Right now!&#x201d;<br> <br>I narrowed my eyes at her. Raegan was exotically beautiful, with long, chestnut-brown hair, bronze skin, and honey-brown eyes. Her nose was perfectly small, not too round or too pointy, and her skin made her look like she came fresh off of a Neutrogena commercial. We met in elementary school, and I was instantly drawn to her brutal honesty. Raegan could be incredibly intimidating, even for Kody, who, at six foot four, was over a foot taller than she was. Her personality was charming to those she loved, and repellent to those she didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>I was the opposite of exotic. My tousled brown bob and heavy bangs were easy to maintain, but not a lot of men found it sexy. Not a lot of men found me sexy in general. I was the girl next door, your brother&#x2019;s best friend. Growing up with three brothers and our cousin Colin, I could have been a tomboy if my subtle but still present curves hadn&#x2019;t ousted me from the boys-only clubhouse at fourteen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be that girl,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you want one, go buy your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>She crossed her arms, pouting. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I quit. They&#x2019;re fucking expensive.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stared at the burning paper and tobacco nestled between my fingers. &#x201c;That is a fact my broke ass continues to make note of.&#x201d;<br> <br>The song switched from something everyone wanted to dance to, to a song no one wanted to dance to, and dozens of people began making their way off the dance floor. Two girls walked up to our table and traded glances.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our table,&#x201d; the blonde said.<br> <br>Raegan barely acknowledged them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, bitch, she&#x2019;s talking to you,&#x201d; the brunette said, setting her beer on the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Raegan,&#x201d; I warned.<br> <br>Raegan looked at me with a blank face, and then up at the girl with the same expression. &#x201c;It was your table. Now it&#x2019;s ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were here first,&#x201d; the blonde hissed.<br> <br>&#x201c;And now you&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; Raegan said. She picked up the unwelcome beer bottle and tossed it across the floor. It spilled out onto the dark, tightly stitched carpet. &#x201c;Fetch.&#x201d;<br> <br>The brunette watched her beer slide across the floor, and then took a step toward Raegan, but her friend grabbed both of her arms. Raegan offered an unimpressed laugh, and then turned her gaze toward the dance floor. The brunette finally followed her friend to the bar.<br> <br>I took a drag from my cigarette. &#x201c;I thought we were going to have a good time tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That was fun, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head, stifling a smile. Raegan was a great friend, but I wouldn&#x2019;t cross her. Growing up with so many boys in the house, I&#x2019;d had enough fighting to last a lifetime. They didn&#x2019;t baby me. If I didn&#x2019;t fight back, they&#x2019;d just fight dirtier until I did. And I always did.<br> <br>Raegan didn&#x2019;t have an excuse. She was just a scrappy bitch. &#x201c;Oh, look. Megan&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; she said, pointing to the blue-eyed, crow-headed beauty on the dance floor. I shook my head. She was out there with Travis Maddox, basically getting screwed in front of everyone on the dance floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, those Maddox boys,&#x201d; Raegan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, downing my whiskey. &#x201c;This was a bad idea. I&#x2019;m not feeling clubby tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, stop.&#x201d; Raegan gulped her whiskey sour and then stood. &#x201c;The whine bags are still eyeing this table. I&#x2019;m going to get us another round. You know the beginning of the night starts off slow.&#x201d;<br> <br>She took my glass and hers and left me for the bar.<br> <br>I turned, seeing the girls staring at me, clearly hoping I would step away from the table. I wasn&#x2019;t about to stand up. Raegan would get the table back if they tried to take it, and that would only cause trouble.<br> <br>When I turned around, a boy was sitting in Raegan&#x2019;s chair. At first I thought Travis had somehow made his way over, but when I realized my mistake, I smiled. Trenton Maddox was leaning toward me, his tattooed arms crossed, his elbows resting on the table across from me. He rubbed the five o&#x2019;clock shadow that peppered his square jaw with his fingers, his shoulder muscles bulging through his T-shirt. He had as much stubble on his face as he did on the top of his head, except for the absence of hair from one small scar near his left temple.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look familiar.&#x201d;<br> <br>I raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Really? You walk all the way over here and sit down, and that&#x2019;s the best you&#x2019;ve got?&#x201d;<br> <br>He made a show of running his eyes over every part of me. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have any tattoos, that I can see. I&#x2019;m guessing we haven&#x2019;t met at the shop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The shop?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The ink shop I work at.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re tattooing now?&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled, a deep dimple appearing in the center of his left cheek. &#x201c;I knew we&#x2019;ve met before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I turned to watch the women on the dance floor, laughing and smiling and watching Travis and Megan vertically dry fucking. But the second the song was over, he left and walked straight over to the blonde who claimed ownership over my table. Even though she&#x2019;d seen Travis running his hands all over Megan&#x2019;s sweaty skin two seconds earlier, she was grinning like an idiot, hoping she was next.<br> <br>Trenton laughed once. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my baby brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t admit it,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did we go to school together?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember if you went to Eakins at any time between kindergarten through twelfth grade?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton&#x2019;s left dimple sunk in when he grinned. &#x201c;Then we know each other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not necessarily.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton laughed again. &#x201c;You want a drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have one coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You wanna dance?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> <br>A group of girls passed by, and Trenton&#x2019;s eyes focused on one. &#x201c;Is that Shannon from home ec? Damn,&#x201d; he said, turning a one-eighty in his seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Indeed it is. You should go reminisce.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton shook his head. &#x201c;We reminisced in high school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember. Pretty sure she still hates you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton shook his head, smiled, and then, before taking another swig, said, &#x201c;They always do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a small town. You shouldn&#x2019;t have burned all of your bridges.&#x201d;<br> <br>He lowered his chin, his famous charm turning up a notch. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a few I haven&#x2019;t lit a fire under.

Phillip is suspicious of "the large Negro," but soon grows to trust--and ultimately love--the patient and generous Timothy.

In the Gospels Jesus asks many more questions than he answers. To be precise, Jesus asks 307 questions. He is asked 183 of which he only answers 3. Asking questions was central to Jesus&#x2019; life and teachings. In fact, for every question he answers directly he asks&#x2014;literally&#x2014;a hundred. Jesus is the Question considers the questions Jesus asks&#x2014;what they tell us about Jesus and, more important, what our responses might say about what it means to follow Him. Through Jesus&#x2019; questions, he modeled the struggle, the wondering, the thinking it through that helps us draw closer to God and better understand, not just the answer, but ourselves, our process and ultimately why questions are among Jesus&#x2019; most profound gifts for a life of faith.

The Cultural Revolution's goal was to purge the country of bourgeois, capitalistic elements he claimed were threatening genuine communist ideology. Young students formed the Red Guards, vowing to defend the Chairman to the death, but soon rival factions started fighting each other in the streets with semiautomatic weapons in the name of revolutionary purity. As the country descended into chaos, the military intervened, turning China into a garrison state marked by bloody purges that crushed as many as one in fifty people.</p><p> <i>The Cultural Revolution: A People's History, 1962&#x2013;1976 </i>draws for the first time on hundreds of previously classified party documents, from secret police reports to unexpurgated versions of leadership speeches. After the army itself fell victim to the Cultural Revolution, ordinary people used the political chaos to resurrect the market and hollow out the party's ideology. By showing how economic reform from below was an unintended consequence of a decade of violent purges and entrenched fear, <i>The Cultural Revolution</i> casts China's most tumultuous era in a wholly new light.</p></p><p><b>Frank Dik�tter </b>is chair professor of humanities at the University of Hong Kong.

Families and communities are increasingly fragmented, loneliness is skyrocketing, and physical and mental health are on the decline. Our unprecedented wealth doesn&#x2019;t seem to be doing us much good.&nbsp; </p> <p> Yet, when we try to help poor people at home or abroad, our implicit assumption is that the goal is to help them to become like us. "If they would just do things our way, they&#x2019;d be fine!" </p> <p> But even when they seem to pursue our path, they too find that the American Dream doesn&#x2019;t work for them. What if we have the wrong idea altogether? What if the molds we are using to help poor people don&#x2019;t actually fit any of us? What if the goal isn&#x2019;t to turn other countries into the United States or to turn America&#x2019;s impoverished communities into its affluent suburbs? </p> <p> In <em>Becoming Whole</em> (building on the best-selling <em>When Helping Hurts</em>), Brian Fikkert and Kelly M. Kapic look at the true sources of brokenness and poverty and uncover the surprising pathways to human flourishing, for poor and non-poor alike. Exposing the misconceptions of both Western Civilization and the Western church about the nature of God, human beings, and the world, they redefine success and offer new ways of achieving that success. Through biblical insights, scientific research, and practical experience, they show you how the good news of the kingdom of God reshapes our lives and our poverty alleviation ministries, moving everybody involved towards wholeness.&nbsp; </p></p><p><p><b>What if we&#x2019;re spreading our own brokenness to the very people we want to help?</b></p><p>Before we try to make Uganda into the U.S. or inner cities into affluent suburbs, we have to consider what might be wrong with our own lives. Sure, our pursuit of the American Dream has made us wealthier than ever before, but at what cost?

This mystical aspect of the black church is deeply implicated in the well-being of African American people but is not the focus of their intentional reflection. Moreover, its traditions are deeply ensconced within the historical memory of the wider society and can be found in Coltrane's riffs, Malcolm's exhortations, the social activism of the Black Lives Matter Movement and the presidency of Barack Hussein Obama. The research in this book-through oral histories, church records, and written accounts--details not only ways in which contemplative experience is built into African American collective worship but also the legacy of African monasticism, a history of spiritual exemplars, and unique meditative worship practices. A groundbreaking work in its original edition, <i>Joy Unspeakable</i> now appears in a new, revised edition to address the effects of this contemplative tradition on activism and politics and to speak to a new generation of readers and scholars.</p><p><b>Barbara A.

Even more amazing, after it's unearthed the artifact releases a powerful signal aimed at Saturn. What sort of alarm has been triggered? To find out, a manned spacecraft, the <i>Discovery</i>, is sent to investigate. Its crew is highly trained--the best--and they are assisted by a self-aware computer, the ultra-capable HAL 9000. But HAL's programming has been patterned after the human mind a little too well. He is capable of guilt, neurosis, even murder, and he controls every single one of <i>Discovery</i>'s components. The crew must overthrow this digital psychotic if they hope to make their rendezvous with the entities that are responsible not just for the monolith, but maybe even for human civilization.<p> Clarke wrote this novel while Stanley Kubrick created the film, the two collaborating on both projects. The novel is much more detailed and intimate, and definitely easier to comprehend. Even though history has disproved its "predictions," it's still loaded with exciting and awe-inspiring science fiction. <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p><b>Arthur C.

In this ground-breaking book, two pioneers of the science of Darwinian medicine argue that illness as well as the factors that predispose us toward it are subject to the same laws of natural selection that otherwise make our bodies such miracles of design. &nbsp;Among the concerns they raise:<br><br>When may a fever be beneficial?<br>Why do pregnant women get morning sickness?<br>How do certain viruses "manipulate" their hosts into infecting others?<br>What evolutionary factors may be responsible for depression and panic disorder?<br><br>Deftly summarizing research on disorders ranging from allergies to Alzheimer's, and form cancer to Huntington's chorea, <i>Why We Get Sick,</i>&nbsp;answers these questions and more. &nbsp;The result is a book that will revolutionize our attitudes toward illness and will intrigue and instruct lay person and medical practitioners alike.</p><p>Is our tendency to &#34;fix&#34; our bodies with medicine keeping them from working exactly as they&#39;re supposed to? Two pioneers of the emerging science of Darwinian medicine argue that illness is part and parcel of the evolutionary system and as such, may be helping us to evolve towards better adaptation to our environment."By bringing the evolutionary vision systematically into one of the last unconquered provinces, Nesse and Williams have devised not only means for the improvement of medicine but fundamental new insights into the human condition."--Edward O. Wilson, Harvard University<br><br> "In moving the focus from 'how' to 'why' questions, Nesse and Williams introduce readers to a new way of thinking about illness, one that promises to be of increasing interest as...our culture turns toward evolutionary explanations for human predicaments."--Peter D.

He rolled it a few inches on the floor by pulling its string, and thought about the real horses in the stable, about how they smelled and blew their noses. But most of his mind was on something far away and outside, and most often he was gazing at the sky outside the west window, seeming to listen for those songs or sounds that only a child can hear.<br> &nbsp;<br> He saw the sunlit blur of his blond eyelashes, and heard, in the shadowy part of the room beyond his island of sunshine, the pleasant voices of his oldest sister, Annie, and his Mama, who had baby sister Frances Eleanor at her breast. The baby made wet sounds and said, &#x201c;Ng, ng,&#x201d; in her throat, and the women&#x2019;s rocking chairs creaked.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were talking again about that thing called Annie&#x2019;s wedding, which was to be soon. Annie talked about it all the time now, with joy and fear in her voice. The boy didn&#x2019;t understand much about it and was not very interested in it. But he liked the music of their voices in the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was always enveloped in the voices of his family. Their voices were always around him like a comforter of many colors. Even when his Papa and his older brothers were out in the barns and fields and woods, and his sisters were elsewhere in the house, he could hear their voices, and the sounds of what they were doing, and know where they were. Right now he could hear his Papa&#x2019;s deep voice outside below the window, with the murmuring voice of Cupid the skinny slave man, and the thunk, thunk of a mallet striking wood. And ...<br> &nbsp;<br> He frowned, and listened hard again for that faraway something, trying to hear through the spinning shrill of the locusts. His Mama would always say he was like a dog listening for summer thunder. Something not quite a sound, something in the sunny distance beyond the meadow gate, had at last softly troubled his inner ear, and his heartbeat sped up a little and he looked at the blue sky over the yellow-green treetops.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he could not tell yet. He turned back to his little wooden horse. He picked it up in his right hand and with his left he reached for a large ball, a ball made of a dried, inflated pig bladder painted blue and green. He put the wheels of the wooden horse on the surface of the ball and made it roll, as if the horse were walking around the world. Then he put them down and listened hard again, now with his eyes shut so he could hear even better. His Mama and sister were still talking, and the baby was still groaning and sucking, and his Papa and the Negro were still talking and hammering down in the driveway, and the locusts were still shrilling, but now Billy knew something was coming, something out beyond the meadow gate, though he could not yet really hear it, and he was growing excited, and behind the bright orange of his sunny eyelids he began to see a remembered face, a pair of dark blue eyes like his own.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mama!&#x201d; he said. His eyes were open wide.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ann Rogers Clark turned to him. &#x201c;Aye, son?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jo jee common!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Say what? Georgie&#x2019;s comin&#x2019;? Nay, Billy, I think not. Georgie&#x2019;s far, far yonder,&#x201d;&#x2014;she nodded toward the west&#x2014;&#x201c;out behind the mountains, where th&#x2019; Indians are. Y&#x2019;know that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He shook his head and frowned. &#x201c;Jo jee common,&#x201d; he insisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mought be he&#x2019;s right?&#x201d; black-haired Annie suggested. &#x201c;He always knows where we all are. Uncanny-like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know. But ... No. George wouldn&#x2019;t come over the mountains now. Not with harvest so close. Not if &#x2019;e grows twenty bushel o&#x2019; corn to the acre out yonder, as he claims. Though that sounds a tall tale to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But,&#x201d; said Annie, &#x201c;he&#x2019;d come home for my wedding!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure and he might, if he knew of&#x2019;t. But he doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy had abandoned his ball and horse and was standing now at the window with his little hands gripping the sill, looking and listening out over the plantation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The only people he could see outside were his Papa and Cupid. They were inserting poles lengthwise through two hogsheads of tobacco. These poles would be axles when the barrels were pulled to market by oxen along the rolling-road.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark and Annie were talking of weddings again, but the woman, bemused, was watching the boy. It was strange how he always just knew where everyone was. Now and then it proved embarrassing, as when he&#x2019;d turn up brother Johnny romancing some wench or other under a haymow or in the barn loft. It was strange, that special sense of Billy&#x2019;s, and it was strange about his dream<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark began rocking her chair again while the baby sucked. She saw how the pressure of the baby&#x2019;s mouth mottled and wrinkled the tired skin of her teat. Twenty-three years she&#x2019;d been bearing and nursing her children, and now one of them, her own namesake, was about to marry and begin the same great, absorbing, demanding, body-and-soul-consuming occupation. For Mrs. Clark, this was a bittersweet time. Now she returned her gaze to Annie&#x2019;s flawless oval face, her wide-set brown eyes, her always-smiling mouth with its full underlip. Her beauty was ripe now. She would begin bearing within this year surely, and with the years those firm teats of hers would darken and wrinkle like these.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ye listen now, Annie, as I&#x2019;m just about to give the very advice my own mother, rest her soul, gave me ere I married your Papa. She said to me, &#x2018;Ann girl, your man will have you with child all the time, if y&#x2019; let him. I&#x2019;ve had nine o&#x2019; you,&#x2019; she told me, &#x2018;and I love y&#x2019;all as I love my life, but if I had it to do over, I&#x2019;d rest a couple o&#x2019; years between. Now, only way to keep your man off you,&#x2019; she told me, &#x2018;is nurse your babies longer, like the Indian women do.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she told me, Annie, and she spoke true. A man thinks that if ye have a babe at your teat, y&#x2019;re still too much in motherin&#x2019; to lay with &#x2019;im yet. A man doesn&#x2019;t know much about such things, and so if he respects you at all, and I know Owen does, why, he&#x2019;ll not press ye. He mought go jump on a slave woman, but he&#x2019;ll leave y&#x2019; be, remember that, Annie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But Mama, y&#x2019;ve bore ten of us,&#x201d; Annie laughed. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t ye remember her advice, or what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark&#x2019;s blue eyes looked at a corner of the ceiling and she nodded and pursed her lips. &#x201c;I remembered it. After I&#x2019;d had Jonathan, and then Georgie right away after him, why, me-thought I&#x2019;d nurse Georgie a long spell and get some respite from that man stuff. I mean, bearing children&#x2019;s a fine thing, most important thing a body can do, I suppose, and what our Dear Lord fit us out to do, but after two, why, the marvel of it&#x2019;d wore off, and I remembered your Grandmama&#x2019;s advice, and I thought t&#x2019; try it. But ... Well, it would ha&#x2019; worked, I reckon, &#x2019;cept I couldn&#x2019;t go through with it. I&#x2019;d see your Papa was a-wantin&#x2019;, lusty man that he is, and I&#x2019;d feel guilty like some sham dodger, not worthy o&#x2019; good John Clark.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And, too&#x2014;Damnation, girl, I&#x2019;ll just out an&#x2019; say it: When John wanted me, I wanted John. And so I weaned little Georgie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Annie clapped her hands and laughed, red-faced. &#x201c;Oh, Mama!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And so &#x2019;twas, by the very next year, &#x2019;54 that was, you came along, my darlin&#x2019;, our first girl, and John honored me by naming you after me. And a blessing y&#x2019;ve been every day o&#x2019; those eighteen years since. So, I guess&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A gunshot echoed out of the woods.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;KSH!&#x201d; Billy imitated it, pointing a finger. &#x201c;Eddie shoot tokey!&#x201d; Then he turned his gaze back toward the road, down beyond the meadow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See?&#x201d; said the girl. &#x201c;He always knows.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aye. And indeed Edmund will have a turkey, by Heaven. He never misses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You were but fourteen when y&#x2019; married Papa, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; said Annie, turning back to marriage talk, her heart&#x2019;s main concern.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Clark put the baby girl on her shoulder and patted her back. &#x201c;Fourteen. Aye, I&#x2019;ve been raisin&#x2019; children far longer than I ever was one myself. Yes, m&#x2019; darlin&#x2019;, I&#x2019;m tired and half broken down by children now. But what better could I ha&#x2019; been doing, I always say, than bringin&#x2019; you ten wonders into this world? If pride&#x2019;s a sin, then I&#x2019;m a sinner. And, then, our Good Lord loads us only with such burdens as he created us fit to carry. I ...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She looked at Billy, who still gripped the windowsill, gripped it hard, his sturdy little body poised like a question mark, his copper-red hair ablaze with sunlight. What on earth has got ahold of him? she wondered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a bit broke down!&#x201d; Annie was protesting. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the most beauteous Mama in Caroline County, nay, in all Virginia, you are.&#x201d; That was an accepted truth, but one that always made Mrs. Clark snort. She snorted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If beauty&#x2019;s what keeps a man jumpin&#x2019; on ye, I&#x2019;d as soon have been homely as ham,&#x201d; she grumbled. But then her face diffused with a golden smile that meant she&#x2019;d been jesting. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;re a kind girl, Annie, and kindness is the best of all your beauty. Thankee for your loving words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Billy now was flexing his knees and glancing frantically toward his mother, then back out the window. He gave a curious little hop of excitement and cried: &#x201c;Jo jee common, Mama!

It is an intense and compelling drama based on the true story of the Carmelite nuns at Compeigne beheaded during the last few days of the Revolution, but also encompassing the Paris mob, the Reign of Terror, women revolutionists, etc., climaxing in the heroic martyrdom of sixteen Carmelites. This story unfolds around Blanche de la Force, who enters the Carmelite convent amid the horror of the French Revolution. Blanche is so timorous that she seems unsuited to the rigors of religious life even at the best of times - and badly misplaced as the Reign of Terror begins to stain France with the blood of martyrs.Sister Marie, one of the leading nuns in the convent, receives with joy the death threats of the revolutionaries: the sisters are going to be awarded the crown of Christian martyrdom! Sister Marie prepares the other nuns for this fearsome sacrifice, all the while harboring doubts about Blanche&#39;s ability and willingness to join them in dying for Christ. Blanche&#39;s life thereafter and the story of the nuns take several unexpected twists, leaving you not only with the inspiring, true witness of their martyrdom, but also with a penetrating insight into the nature of holiness. As our world is engulfed anew in terror and hatred for the Christian faith, The Song at the Scaffold will inspire us with a renewed and fervent love for God.</p><p>Gertrud von le Fort attended the universities of Heidelberg, Berlin and Marburg.

In Painted Rock, Wyoming, Caradec found land for a man to love, miles of rolling grasslands and towering mountains. He also found that one of the most ruthless men in the territory had set his sights on both Rodney&#x2019;s ranch and his daughter.

But Ann thought Rafe was moving in for his own crooked gain, and played right into the deadly hands of the greedy ranchers plotting to destroy her. Then Rafe figured a way to save Ann and the land.

Among the many scary creatures that inhabit the deep sea, Kraken is the most feared. He's the biggest and makes even giant whales flee in terror. However, under that steely and scary exterior, Kraken just wants a friend. He tries to hide his appearance and trick other creatures of the sea into liking him, to no avail. He throws one of the biggest tantrums under the sea but realizes that it might not be so hard after all to make friends after soliciting advice from another feared underwater creature, the great white shark. Kids who are finding it difficult to make friends will enjoy this funny yet heartfelt story. The message of being true to oneself and not changing for the sake of others will ring true and is never presented in a way that is didactic.

Since its publication in Russian in 1963, it has been used as the main theology textbook at Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary in Jordanville, New York; and since the publication of the first English edition in 1983, it has come to be regarded throughout the English-speaking world as one of the best introductory books on Orthodox theology. Written clearly, simply and concisely, this modern-day classic is accessible not only to theology students but to the contemporary layman in general. As one deeply rooted in the tradition of the Orthodox Church, Fr. Michael quotes abundantly from the Holy Scriptures and the writings of the Holy Fathers, being concerned to present, not human opinions, but Divine Revelation, which has been handed down to us as the Church s certain, unchanging teaching. <p> EXPANDED THIRD EDITION: In the first English edition, Fr. Seraphim added many substantive footnotes in order to provide clarification on certain points or to introduce helpful information not included in the main text. In this third English edition, yet more notes have been added, primarily consisting of quotations from the Holy Fathers, in order to further elucidate Orthodox doctrines. This edition also includes a new preface, a new bibliography, and an expanded index.</p></p><p>As briefly as possible I have set forth for you our love of wisdom, which is dogmatical and not dialectical, in the manner of the fisherman and not of Aristotle, spiritually and not clearly woven, according to the rules of the Church and not the marketplace. --St. Gregory the Theologian, 4th CenturyIn the writings of Fr. Michael Pomazansky, one may see a characteristic of genuine Orthodox theology that is so often lost sight of in our cold, rationalistic age. Theology is not primarily a matter of arguments, criticisms, proofs and disproofs; it is first of all men s <i>word about God</i>, in accordance with the Divinely revealed teaching of Orthodoxy. Therefore, its first purpose and intent is always to inspire, to warm the heart, to lift one above the petty preoccupations of earth in order to glimpse the Divine beginning and end of all things and so to give one the energy and encouragement to struggle towards God and our heavenly homeland.... <p> Fr. Michael s theology is in this warm-hearted and inspiring tone. He is not the only one to write Orthodox theology with this intent today, but he is one of the few, in an older generation that is fast vanishing, who can serve as a link between us and the genuine theology of the Holy Fathers....<i>Orthodox Dogmatic Theology</i> is his masterpiece. -- --Hieromonk Seraphim Rose</p></p><h2>Ophelia</h2><p><p><b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE!</b><br><b></b><br><b>If you think you know Ophelia and Hamlet's story, think again... </b><br><b><i>"A spellbinding tale of love, murder, and revenge." -- VOYA </i></b></p><p>As ambitious and witty as she is beautiful, Ophelia is quick to catch the eye of the captivating prince Hamlet. Their love blossoms in secret, but bloody deeds soon turn Denmark into a place of madness, and Ophelia may be forced to choose between her relationship and her own life. In desperation, she devises a plan to escape from Elsinore Castle forever... with one very dangerous secret.</p><p>Ophelia takes center stage in this bold and thrilling reimagining of Shakespeare's famous tragedy, the story of a young woman falling in love, searching for her place in the world, and finding the strength to survive.</p></p><p>Lisa Klein, a former English professor, is the author of five historical novels for teen readers. She lives in Columbus, Ohio.Grade 8 Up&#x2014;Using Hamlet as the basis for her tale, Klein relates the familiar events from the play, with Ophelia as the focal point. Thus, readers see the social-climbing Polonius as a negligent father, the queenly Gertrude as a concerned and observant mentor, the bewildered Hamlet as a fervent lover, and Horatio as a loyal friend who loves Ophelia from afar. But the novel goes beyond the life of the play for, instead of dying, Ophelia secretly weds Hamlet, escapes Elsinore (taking refuge in a convent in France), bears Hamlet's son, and reunites romantically with Horatio to bring the story full circle. Easy to follow and moving at a rapid pace, the story introduces new characters who add depth to the tale. Klein sets the story in the Elizabethan era rather than in the medieval time frame of the original play; her detail-rich text conveys considerable information about courtly life, intrigue, and the societal mores of the times. She includes adapted versions of some of Shakespeare's best-known lines to keep the flavor of the Bard's work; however, the changes in the language may strike a discordant note with purists and with those who prefer the poetic text. Nonetheless, this is a successful and engaging story that is more thought-provoking than Lisa Fiedler's <i>Dating Hamlet</i> (Holt, 2002), as it deals with issues of justice more than revenge, with wholeness of character more than romance. It is sure to be popular with young women struggling with issues of honor, betrayal, and finding one's path.&#x2014;<i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the outset the play was a sensational success, although Shaw, irritated by its popularity at the expense of his artistic intentions, dismissed it as a potboiler. The Pygmalion of legend falls in love with his perfect female statue and persuades Venus to bring her to life so that he can marry her. But Shaw radically reworks Ovid&#x2019;s tale to give it a feminist slant: while Higgins teaches Eliza to speak and act like a duchess, she also asserts her independence, adamantly refusing to be his creation.<br><br> This Penguin Classics edition&nbsp;is the definitive text produced under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence, with an illuminating introduction by Nicholas Grene, discussing the language and politics of the play. Included in this volume is Shaw&#x2019;s preface, as well as his &#x201c;sequel&#x201d; written for the first publication in 1916, to rebut public demand for a more conventionally romantic ending.<p>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system.<br>In Shaw's clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.<br>The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made <i>Pygmalion</i> one of the most popular comedies in the English language.</p><p></p>One of Shaw's most enduring works, Pygmalion is an insightful comedy of class relations and perceptions, as played out between a Cockney flower girl and the irascible speech professor who has taken her on as a pet project. Described by critics as "a play of great vitality and charm," Pygmalion inspired the award-winning stage and film productions of Lerner and Loewe's musical, My Fair Lady. <p> An L.A.

Fundamental to the book&#39;s thesis is a rejection of the frequent identification of &#39;revival&#39; with &#39;revivalism&#39;. The author demonstrates that a common understanding of the New Testament idea of revival was prevalent in most denominations throughout the period 1750-1858. Revivalism, on the other hand, is different both in its origin and in its tendencies. Its ethos is mancentred and its methods too close to the manipulative to require a supernatural explanation. Iain Murray argues that an inability to recognize this distinction has led many to ignore the new and different teaching on evangelism and revival which began to be popularized in the 1820s. While the case against that teaching was argued almost universally by the leaders of the Second Great Awakening their testimony was submerged beneath propaganda which promised a &#39;new era&#39; if only the churches would abandon the older ways. Today, when that propaganda is largely discredited, there is a great need to rediscover the earlier understanding of revival possessed by those who most intimately experienced it. Revival and Revivalism will do much to aid this rediscovery. Powerfully presented, it contains a message of major importance for contemporary Christians.</p><p>&#39;Anyone interested in revivals of religion, whether that interest grows primarily out of the academy or the church, will find Revival and Revivalism a valuable new resource.&#39;</p><h2>Faust: Part Two (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This is a new translation of Faust, Part Two by David Luke, whose translation of Faust, Part I was the winner of the European Poetry Translation Prize.

Being inspired by the nature around you is the first step to becoming a botanical artist.</p><p>Born 1983 in Ankara, Turkey, I&#x15f;ik G�ner originally graduated in Environmental Engineering. However, instead of this she chose an entirely different path and has been working full time as a botanical artist for over 10 years. She is very glad she made this decision, though as the child of a botanist father and growing up surrounded by wild nature, her decision was easy.<br><br>I&#x15f;&#x131;k's painting of Gunnera Tinctoria won an RHS Gold Medal and the RHS Best Painting in Show in Spring 2014. She has worked on various international botanical projects around the world. She is also a visiting tutor for the Diploma in Botanical Illustration at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and delivers tuition through workshops in Europe.Foreward<br>In the world we live in today, many new plant species are regularly being discovered, but even more are facing the threat of extinction. There are many contributing factors, but one of the main reasons is human activity. The dilemma is that although our lives depend on plant materials from the earth, we choose to live in opposition to nature, and this represents a real threat to wildlife. Although a lot of research has been done, and a great deal of information collected over the centuries, I believe that the main cause of this threat is a lack of awareness that every living thing matters, is interconnected and relies on every other living thing to survive. Botanical illustrations are becoming essential at this time, as they play a vital role in making this information easier to understand. They are visually striking and focus attention on a particular plant, and consequently the information that comes along with it. Visual communication, in the form of painting, is an effective way to share this knowledge. <br> &nbsp;<br> Botanical artists hold a unique status: they can record plants and show them to the world, unlocking science for people outside of that world, enabling them to be seduced by the most beautiful images, drawn and painted by very skilled hands. Botanical artists have an amazing opportunity to form a bridge between the scientific world and the general public. Depicting and simplifying information in the most beautiful way, they can communicate to those who might consider scientific information boring. Illustrations help to raise awareness of the valuable knowledge that scientists have been researching and discovering over many years<br> &nbsp;<br> My own journey began when I was studying environmental engineering at university. The word &#x2018;environmental&#x2019; might lead you to think that the two areas are related. However, I assure you that what I do now is something else entirely, and how I ended up as a botanical artist is another story. My studies certainly developed my sense of structure, improved my ability to see things in a three-dimensional way on a flat surface and gave me the discipline to work methodically. These skills have been very useful to me as I have sought to produce successful illustrations<br> &nbsp;<br> In this book, I am going to share with you my experiences of looking at wild species from around the world, as well as how I do my research and how I compose my illustrations from live specimens. I really hope this will help you in your own journey and inspire you to look for some plant samples and pick up your pencils<br> &nbsp;<br> Finding ways to communicate, to draw and paint plants in the wild, is a burning passion for me. Through this book, I have the opportunity to share this with everyone who reads it. It is full of my thoughts on plants in the wild and how to get the best drawings and the most skilfully painted studies of plants, some of which have never been seen before<br> &nbsp;<br> Obviously, it is wonderful if you know a scientist who can help explain the botany of a plant that you are working on. I was so lucky to grow up in a family with a botanist father, and I had the great fortune of being taken out on frequent field trips to unusual places in Turkey and around the world. But if you don&#x2019;t have a botanist to hand, there are many other ways to do your own research and gather information. Knowledge is more easily acquired in this era<br> &nbsp;<br> If you want to practise botanical illustration, it must become your passion. There should be a gathering momentum, from learning how to make basic drawings and paintings of plants, to enjoying and wanting to describe more plants in your own way. This is the passion that I feel. I need to draw each day. The more I do it, the more infectious it becomes. It is a way of life for me, and a really great way to live a life that is more connected to nature. In this fast-moving world that we live in, it is a joy to be a botanical artist. I love the fact that I am creating a legacy, a collection of artworks that tell a story of plants growing in natural places which, unfortunately, might not be there forever. While plant conservation is a very important issue nowadays, I very much like the idea that knowledge about particular plants will be passed on to future generations through scientific illustrations. Of course there is also lots to be gained from just enjoying drawing and painting nature for its own sake<br> &nbsp;<br> Look around you &#x2013; nature is just out there! Look closely, deep inside, and see all the magnificent details in the diversity of nature surrounding us. Being in contact with nature can trigger something inside you and make you feel more connected to this incredible earth in which we live.

Although my strange attraction to our new home never faded and questions remained unanswered, I pushed them aside and threw myself into my new role as mother.<br><br>An engaging and guileless little girl, Annie had inherited equal parts from each parent. She had bright green eyes and an odd crescent-shaped birthmark on the inside of her forearm from her mother, and fair hair and perfectly shaped ears from her father. But her little personality was all her own. She was everything I could have wanted in a child.<br><br>Annie was a gentle baby, which made it easy for us to resume our adult lives when she was still quite young. She went everywhere with us, her fair head poking up over the carrier strapped to one of our backs. We enjoyed being together, our little family.<br><br>Annie was only twenty-three months old when we took her to see her first comet atop Moon Mountain. Sky watching was a hobby of mine, introduced to me as a child by my Cherokee grandmother, and I was eager to share it with my daughter. Genetti's Comet would be sharing the sky with a total lunar eclipse-a rare enough event to warrant mention of it in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Moon Mountain wasn't really a mountain, but rather a largish hill and the perfect vantage point for celestial happenings. According to my grandmother, who was widely known for her eccentricities, it was a place with strong unknown powers. She called it a sacred place to the Cherokee Indians, who had inhabited this part of the country for centuries.<br><br>Michael grumbled only slightly when I roused him that Saturday morning. It was usually his sleeping-in day, but I had made plans for an early start at antique shopping and general family togetherness before the lunar eclipse that night. He leaned over and rubbed his stubbly chin on my bare midriff, where my nightgown had ridden up. Resting his head on my abdomen, he gently traced a circle around my navel with his finger. I ran my hands through the thick mane of his hair and sighed softly. He looked up at me with a raised eyebrow.<br><br>"Laura, why don't we just skip the shooting star and stay in bed all day?" He rose to nuzzle into my neck, sending delicious shivers down my back.<br><br>I pressed my head into the pillow and tapped him gently on the head with the flat of my palm. "It's not a shooting star-it's a comet and an eclipse. It'll really be spectacular."<br><br>"Mmmmm," he mumbled.<br><br>I shifted my head, enjoying his attentions to my earlobe. Slowly, he worked the spaghetti straps of my nightgown off my shoulder and moved his mouth lower. I looked down at his dark blond head, and my body flooded with love and desire for this man. I sighed, and our eyes met.<br><br>His moist lips formed a slow grin. "I've got powerful methods of persuasion, you know."<br><br>I sat up, pulling off my nightgown completely. "Yes, you do. You certainly do."<br><br>We made love slowly, in the comfortable way old lovers do, and then we held each other close, listening to the sounds of morning outside our window.<br><br>"Mommy!" came the shout from across the hall.<br><br>The sound made me grimace. Reluctantly, I threw off the sheets. "It was nice while it lasted," I said as I slipped out of bed and into my robe. I leaned down to give Michael a kiss and then hurried to the nursery, where I was being summoned in a tone approaching hysteria.<br><br>Annie clutched the top rail of her crib, huge tears of distress running down her cheeks. I tripped over the object of her anguish and bent to pick up her stuffed giraffe from the floor, the apparent victim of a fall through the crib slats. Her chubby arms stretched up to greet me as I approached. I handed her the giraffe and reached for her.<br><br>"Hello, morning glory," I whispered as I picked her up and kissed her baby-fine hair. The mingled scents of baby sweat and shampoo wafted up my nose. "Can Mommy have some good-morning butterflies?"<br><br>Annie put her face right up to mine and fluttered her eyelashes, tickling my cheek. She then laid her head on my shoulder, a cue for me to sing and waltz. This had been our morning ritual for as long as we both could remember.<br><br>"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray," I sang as I twirled my delighted partner, my bare feet padding gently on the hardwood floors of the nursery. "You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away."<br><br>As I placed her on the changing table to dress her, Michael came in to give Annie her good-morning kiss. "Maybe we should get your mother to babysit Annie tonight. I mean, she'll probably sleep through the whole thing, anyway."<br><br>I finished snapping up the bottom of Annie's one-piece outfit and lifted her. "Oh, Michael-I thought it would be so much fun with the three of us. My dad used to take me when I was her age, and I remember watching the sky with him. It's such a magical thing."<br><br>He shrugged. "All right. If it means that much to you." He kissed me quickly on the lips and reached for his daughter.<br><br>I was fascinated by comets-those ghostly apparitions from the past traveling along sweeping pathways through space and time. Historically, comets have always been harbingers of doom, having made appearances prior to the assassination of Julius Caesar, the Black Death, the defeat of the Alamo, and the fall of Atlanta to the Yankees in the summer of 1863. Ancient man thought that comets were God's messengers alerting mankind of what was to come. Despite Mr. Haley's scientific explanation on the origins of comets, I, too, thought there was something more ethereal about those dirty snowballs of ice and dust.<br><br>I was especially intrigued because of something my grandmother had told me when I was a girl. As I was leaving her house after a day of learning about folklore and her own brand of ancient astronomy, Grandma had held my arm and whispered in my ear, "Be careful of moonless nights and speeding stars. Though the magic is there, there is danger, too, and great heartache."<br><br>I had no idea what she was talking about, and she refused to elaborate further on subsequent visits. But her prophetic words would always return to me as I climbed Moon Mountain to witness yet another astronomical event.<br><br>Double-checking the diaper bag for Annie's hat and sunscreen, I loaded it into the Explorer. As I bent down to tie my shoelaces, a bead of perspiration dripped on my knee. At ten o'clock in the morning, it was already sweltering-a typical August day in Georgia.<br><br>It had rained during the night. Not one of those gentle rainstorms found in northern climes, but a powerful combination of window-shaking thunder and daylight-making lightning common to Georgia and other Southern coastal states. But the sky above was now cloudless, a blue dome over the baking earth.<br><br>By the end of the day, we found ourselves at the foot of Moon Mountain. The National Park Service had fashioned an asphalt parking lot at the foot of the hill, and I was happy to see that there were no other cars. Even at nine o'clock at night, the heat rose from the blacktop. Perspiration prickled down my back as I stooped to get our sleeping Annie out of her car seat. I had tried to keep her awake in the car, but her exhaustion had finally overtaken her. I hoped she would wake up in time to see her first comet.<br><br>Her head lolled to one side and I carefully cradled it as I lifted her out. I zipped her snugly into the carrier on Michael's back and laid a gentle kiss on her sweaty cheek.<br><br>The gravel path cut across the hillside and disappeared around the bend. We hastily checked the car door, then began our ascent, refraining from talking so we wouldn't disturb Annie. Despite the additional twenty pounds on his back, Michael kept a grueling pace. The only sounds besides the crunching of the gravel beneath our feet were the constant whirring of the cicadas and the distant hum of traffic from Highway 9. My shirt began to stick to my back and quickly became drenched under the arms. With a quick glance behind me to ensure that we were alone, I slid off my backpack for a moment to remove my shirt and continue the climb in my bra. Michael raised an eyebrow and shook his head in mock exasperation.<br><br>My heart softened as I watched Annie in her little cocoon, one plump hand resting on her father's shoulder and her thumb on her other hand firmly implanted in her mouth. During our climb, I could occasionally hear frenzied sucking coming from the little bundle on Michael's back, and it made me smile. She was worth every visit to the fertility clinic, every poke and prod from doctors, every ounce of despair. Even after all we had gone through, we almost lost her to placental abruption in the delivery room. Only an emergency C-section had saved her life. And mine. We longed for another child, but I wasn't quite ready to accept the risk again.<br><br>We reached the crest in about thirty minutes. I quickly took off my backpack and rifled through it for Annie's blanket. I laid it on the ground by the side of a pine tree and gently lifted the still-sleeping Annie. She stirred slightly and raised her ruffle-covered rump in the air. Her thumb found her mouth again and she settled back down.<br><br>I walked toward the edge where a coin-operated telescope was mounted, unnecessary for reveling in the beauty of our secluded spot. The twinkling skyline of Atlanta lay to the south and I could pick out the Bank of America tower rising higher than its sister skyscrapers. A halo of light, outlined in the purple tinge of dusk, surrounded the skyline in a gentle benediction. Genetti's Comet glowed dimly on the horizon.<br><br>Michael approached and pressed his bare chest against my back. I reached behind me to grasp hold of him. His expert hands quickly unsnapped my bra and then slid around to cup my breasts. I laid my head on his shoulder as he planted lingering kisses on my neck.<br><br>"You taste salty," he said as his lips traveled down to my shoulder.<br><br>I sighed, enjoying the caress of goose bumps as they traveled down my spine. "Michael, not here. Someone might see." I made no move to step away.<br><br>Annie grunted in her sleep, and I shifted around in Michael's arms. "Can you hold that thought until later?"<br><br>He touched my cheek, his fingers slowly traveling down to my neck. "If I have to." He reached behind me and refastened my bra.<br><br>"I have something to cool you off." I stepped back and walked toward where we had dumped our gear. "We should drink something so we don't become dehydrated. I learned that in my new-mommy CPR class." I squatted in front of my backpack and pulled out two bottles of water.<br><br>We sat next to each other, leaning against a scrubby tree trunk, and drank our water in companionable silence while waiting for night to fall completely. A soft snore came from Annie, and the rhythm of it lulled us both to a semiconscious stupor. Michael's head sagged forward and I reached my hand up to wake him, only to find myself seemingly paralyzed. I willed my limb to move, but it lay limp and useless at my side. I struggled to keep my eyes open, but an unseen force seemed to be dragging me into a deep, dark slumber. I made an attempt to wiggle my toes, recalling how doing that had brought me out of bad dreams when I was a girl. Nothing moved; I was completely immobile. The last thing I remembered was reaching for Annie.<br><br>I dreamed I was running through darkness. My legs were leaden weights and would not propel me toward a dim light shining though the murkiness. A pervading sense of loss enveloped me, and I knew escape was neither imminent nor possible. A loud whirring sound buzzed in my ear and I turned my head from side to side to make it stop.<br><br>I woke up to find a cicada screeching loudly on the tree trunk next to my head. I struggled to orient myself for a moment until I remembered where I was. It was too dark to see my watch, but the sunlight filtering around the earth's edge had turned the moon a vivid red. A black shadow had already hooded a quarter of the moon, causing me to recall the Mayan myth of a jaguar wolfing down the lunar orb.<br><br>I reached over to feel for Annie and my hands found the warm tangle of her hair. I moved my palm to her back to feel her strong rhythmic breathing and the heat of her body. Michael's outline slumped asleep against the tree trunk next to me, and I decided not to disturb him just yet. I wanted a private moment with the comet alone before I had to share it. Standing, and trying to recall how much wine I had had at dinner, I walked to the clearing to get a better view of the eclipse. I caught a strong whiff of gardenias, which surprised me, as I didn't remember seeing any on our climb up.<br><br>Genetti's Comet hovered brightly in the darkened sky. A chill swept down my spine, raising the hair on the back of my neck. I shivered involuntarily and wrapped my arms around me. It was then that I realized that the insects had ceased their nocturnal chorus. I couldn't hear the traffic anymore. Silence hugged the hilltop, enshrouding us. A strong wind began to blow, whipping my hair about my face, but the sound it made wasn't the gentle whooshing noise that precedes a storm. Instead, the wind howled loudly and then softly, swirling around my head so I couldn't determine the direction. The strong scent of gardenias assaulted my nose again, and I trembled with an unseen fear. My head pounded and the blood rushed through my ears, the pressure so intense that I fell to my knees.<br><br>Annie. Something was wrong and I had to get to Annie. I panicked, trying to reach the spot where I had left her in the dark. I stumbled on something hard and rough and fell to the ground. I cried out Michael's name, but I couldn't hear anything over the din of the wind. I crawled on my hands and knees, crying out their names. Only the wind answered me. My fingers grasped the edge of the blanket where Annie had been sleeping, and I began to sob with relief. I crawled over it until I realized it was empty. The bile of pure terror crept up my throat and I threw up. I was still gagging when a hand touched my shoulder.</p><h2>Into the Deep: An Unlikely Catholic Conversion</h2><p><i>Into the Deep&nbsp;</i>traces one woman's spiritual odyssey from birthright evangelicalism through postmodern feminism and, ultimately, into the Roman Catholic Church. As a college student, Abigail Favale experienced a feminist awakening that reshaped her life and faith. A decade later, on the verge of atheism, she found herself entering the oldest male-helmed institution on the planet--the last place she expected to be.&nbsp;<br> With humor and insight, the author describes her gradual exodus from Christian orthodoxy and surprising swerve into Catholicism. She writes candidly about grappling with wounds from her past, Catholic sexual morality, the male priesthood, and an interfaith marriage. Her vivid prose brings to life the wrenching tumult of conversion--a conversion that began<i>&nbsp;after</i>&nbsp;she entered the Church and began to pry open its mysteries. There, she discovered the startling beauty of a sacramental cosmos, a vision of reality that upended her notions of gender, sexuality, identity, and authority.&nbsp;<i>Into the Deep&nbsp;</i>is a thoroughly twenty-first-century conversion, a compelling account of recovering an ancient faith after a decade of doubt.</p><p>Abigail Favale directs the William Penn Honors Program at George Fox University, where she teaches seminars in the great books. Her essays and short fiction have appeared in numerous publications, such as <i>The Atlantic</i> and <i>First Things</i>. She was awarded the J.F. Powers Prize for Short Fiction in 2017 and is currently a writing fellow on issues of life and human dignity for Notre Dame's <i>Church Life Journal.</i>"There are events in life that leave you changed forever, right down to the very roots and heart of your being, because they go 'into the deep.' Like this book. Reading it is bound to be an event like that in the lives of two classes of readers if they dare to read it with open minds and hearts: those who call themselves Evangelicals and those who call themselves Christian 'feminists.' The theology is profoundly Christ-centered, the psychology trustably honest, and the style winsomely alive."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Peter Kreeft, best-selling author and professor at Boston College&nbsp;<br><br>"Into the Deep is a beautifully written story of conversion. In this raw and compelling narrative, Favale reminds us that, in the most mysterious of ways, God's grace can reach all of us."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Carrie Gress, best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>The Marian Option&nbsp;</i><br><br>"Religious conversion narratives tend to be unrealistic, focusing on single epiphanies that are rare to most human beings. Not Into the Deep. Abigail Favale has written a conversion memoir that focuses on the slow process of conversion, one that unfolds through a union of practice and intellectual inquiry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She is more like a tour guide, bringing even cradle Catholics like myself into a deeper appreciation of the mystery of the Church. Into the Deep is Augustine's Confessions written for our own age."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Tim O'Malley, author of&nbsp;<i>Bored Again Catholic&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Off the Hook: God, Love, Dating, and Marriage in a Hookup World</i><br>"With sympathetic and smart satire that is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor, Favale finds both sincerity and shallowness in the waves of ideological affiliations that tided her youth. Favale, the unlikely convert, persuades us that by sacramental grace and the communion of saints, the Church can see the meanest sinner hold her breath long enough to work out Her shared salvation in fear and trembling."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-- Joshua Hren, author of&nbsp;<i>This Our Exile: Stories</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Middle-Earth and the Return of the Common Good: J.R.R.

(<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).</p></p><p><b>Margaret George</b> is the author of <i>The Autobiography of Henry VIII, Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles</i>, and<i> Elizabeth I, </i>among other novels. Margaret first got the idea to write historical fiction when, after reading numerous books that viewed Henry VIII through the eyes of his enemies and victims, she found herself wondering if there might be another side to the story. She became determined to let Henry speak for himself, and it took fifteen years, about three hundred books of background reading, three visits to England to see every extant building associated with Henry, and five handwritten drafts for her to answer the question: What was Henry really like? Margaret was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and has traveled extensively. She and her husband live in Madison, Wisconsin.Passionate, mysterious Cleopatra VII of Egypt tells the story of her life and the history of Egypt during the lives of Julius Caesar and Marc Antony. Egyptian court intrigue, Roman politics and military campaigns are accurately recounted through the lively narration of Chelsea Adams. The lack of vocal characterizations is perfect for a first-person tale, particularly with all the changes in locale. Cleopatra&#39;s famous marriage to Julius Caesar and her love of Marc Antony are described by Cleopatra through George&#39;s imagination and Adams&#39;s sweet voice. George and Adams combine efforts to bring Cleopatra&#39;s famous story to life for the listener. M.B.K.

After all, the kid&#x2019;s got the money he was paid for his film, which is more than I had a year ago, so he doesn&#x2019;t need me for anything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He just doesn&#x2019;t need you for buying stuff,&#x201d; Dino pointed out. &#x201c;He still needs a father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You really think so?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ben needs me, I&#x2019;m sure of that. Why wouldn&#x2019;t Peter need you, what with his mother dead and all?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got Hattie. They&#x2019;re sleeping together, you know.&#x201d;<br>Dino laughed aloud. &#x201c;No shit? What were you doing your freshman year?&#x201d;<br>Stone shrugged. &#x201c;Fucking my brains out, if I recall correctly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Actually, you continued to do that, at least until you and Arrington got married.&#x201d;<br>Stone managed a smile. &#x201c;If anything, the activity increased after that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting worried about you, kiddo,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna have to get back in the saddle pretty soon or you&#x2019;re gonna forget how.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, I think about that a lot. It&#x2019;s just that . . . well, it&#x2019;s like not being hungry at dinnertime. I just don&#x2019;t have an appetite.&#x201d;<br>Dino turned and watched as a very pretty brunette in a short skirt came through the door and took a seat at the bar, crossing her long legs. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t that do anything for you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;I mean, I remember what it was like, the way you remember how you roller-skated when you were a kid, but it just isn&#x2019;t all that appealing.&#x201d;<br>Dino felt for Stone&#x2019;s pulse and looked at his watch. &#x201c;Your vital signs seem normal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s something, I guess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; Dino said, nodding toward the door.<br>Stone turned in time to see a tall redhead in a well-cut pantsuit enter the restaurant. She headed for their table and sat down. &#x201c;Hello, sailors,&#x201d; she said, leering a little.<br>Stone leaned over and kissed her. &#x201c;Hello, Holly. What brings you to town?&#x201d;<br>Dino kissed her, too. &#x201c;Same question here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Agency business,&#x201d; Holly Barker replied. She was an assistant deputy director for the CIA. &#x201c;I hope you guys remember that you&#x2019;re still under contract to us as consultants.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How could we forget?&#x201d; Stone asked. &#x201c;Lance keeps reminding us.&#x201d; Lance Cabot was Holly&#x2019;s boss, deputy director for operations, or DDO.<br>&#x201c;Well, fellas, you&#x2019;re about to get the call again.&#x201d;<br>Stone slumped. &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you,&#x201d; Holly replied.<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell us what?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I can&#x2019;t tell you, dummy,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;What kind of deal is this?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the deal: you get the daily rate specified in your contract and five hundred per diem.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For how long?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;That depends on how good you are,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Who can live on five hundred a day?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Clearly, you&#x2019;ve been living too well,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;If you stay at a Holiday Inn Express, and eat at McDonald&#x2019;s, you can make money on that. Would you like my office to book you in?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make my own arrangements.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll make mine, too,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a regular travel agent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As you wish,&#x201d; Holly said.<br>&#x201c;Come on, give us a hint.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the only hint you&#x2019;re going to get,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a car left for you at the Manassas, Virginia, airport. There&#x2019;ll be an envelope locked in the glove compartment containing your credentials.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Credentials?&#x201d; Dino asked. &#x201c;You think we don&#x2019;t know who we are?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;but nobody in Washington does. You&#x2019;ll have to prove it, especially at the White House.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which White House is that?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;The only one,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Find yourselves hotel rooms, then be there at six sharp tomorrow evening, freshly scrubbed and pressed. If you&#x2019;re lucky, you&#x2019;ll get dinner, but don&#x2019;t count on it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it black tie?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that important,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Just wear one of your nice suits.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The blue or the pinstripe?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Your choice, sweetie. By the way, I&#x2019;m very sorry for your loss.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you. I got your very nice letter. I&#x2019;m afraid I haven&#x2019;t responded to all those yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How are you and the boyfriend doing?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s running a big trauma center in San Diego,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t take to the agency life&#x2014;not enough blood and guts, I guess. It&#x2019;s been a couple of months. It was amicable.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let me get you a drink and a menu,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Love to, but can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a chopper waiting for me at the West Side heliport, and I&#x2019;ve got a briefcase full of work to keep me awake on the flight home.&#x201d; She stood up, and both men stood up with her.<br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow evening,&#x201d; she said, then walked briskly out.<br>They sat down again.<br>&#x201c;Why did you ask her about the boyfriend?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Because I knew you wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Dino replied.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>STONE PACKED A BAG THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THEN, ON second thought, packed a second bag. The last time he had consulted for the CIA, he, Holly, and Dino had spent a couple of weeks on a tropical isle, pursuing a federal fugitive named Teddy Fay, who gave them the slip. Who knew how long this one would take or where they would end up?<br>He took the elevator down to the garage and put his bags in the car, then he went to his office and wondered what to put in his briefcase.<br>Joan Robertson, his secretary, appeared in the doorway. &#x201c;You off to someplace?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To Washington&#x2014;for a few days, I think.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Could be longer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of those things for Lance Cabot and Holly Barker. Who knows?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better take your passport,&#x201d; she said, opening his safe and tossing him the document.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d take my vaccinations, if I knew which ones to take,&#x201d; he replied.<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look very happy about this,&#x201d; Joan said, pouring him a cup of coffee.<br>LM</p></p><h2>Complete Guide to Watercolor Painting (Dover Art Instruction)</h2><p>The author of this superb guide was not only a renowned watercolor painter but also a brilliant teacher with an unmatched talent for conveying to his students the techniques and aesthetic philosophy underlying great paintings.

No matter how many times she told herself it was true, she still couldnt believe it. Not Eve Duncan. Not her friend, the woman who had helped to save her son. <br>Agent Ling? A sandy-haired young man was running after Catherine as she headed for baggage. Im Brad Linden. He showed her his CIA credentials. Agent Venable sent me to pick you up and take you to the memorial service. <br>Then go get your car while I pick up my bag. Catherine Ling didnt stop as she strode ahead of him. And why the hell didnt Venable come and get me himself? I need to have a few choice words with him. <br>Hes at the service. Its going on right now. He didnt want to show disrespect. Im afraid youre a little late. <br>Because no one told me that Eve She broke off. He was gazing at her warily, and she knew she must be radiating all the ferocity and sadness she was feeling. There was no use ripping at Venables errand boy because Venable had left her in ignorance of Eves death or the search when she was kidnapped several days ago. He would only try to make excuses for the inexcusable. Yes, she had been undercover in the jungles of Colombia, but that didnt mean that she wouldnt have somehow extricated herself and come home to help find Eve. Venable should have gotten word to her. No, shed had to find out in Miami when shed retrieved her own computer and been hit in the gut with the news story in <i>USA Today.</i> Just have that car out front and get me to that memorial service ASAP, Linden. <br>While she was waiting for her bag, she scanned the story in <i>USA Today</i> again. What did she expect to find? She had practically memorized the damn story on the flight from Miami. She supposed that she was trying to find an answer when there was no answer. The actual story of Eves kidnapping and murder was fairly cut-and-dried. The murderer had obviously been unbalanced and ignited explosives at a ghost town in Colorado, where he had been holding Eve captive. Since the details were sparse, they had concentrated on Eve Duncan herself. Her background, her accomplishments, quotes from famous law-enforcement officials who had used her services. All were very worth reading, Catherine thought bitterly. It wasnt often that the media got a chance to spotlight a genuinely good person. Eve had been an illegitimate child born in the slums who had given birth herself at sixteen to a little girl, Bonnie. The child had changed her life. Eve had finished her education and straightened out her mother, who was on drugs. Then the world had come crashing down when her Bonnie, seven years old, had been kidnapped and killed. Yet Eve hadnt let it destroy her. She had gone back to school and studied forensic sculpting. Since then, she had become perhaps the most skilled forensic sculptor in the world. She had brought closure to thousands of families whose children would never have been identified without her help. <br>Never let a good deed go unpunished, Catherine thought. That old adage was too true in Eves case. <br>And, dammit, she was misting up again. She closed her computer and jammed it in her carry-on bag. She grabbed her phone and tried Joe Quinn again. Voice mail. Shed called him from the Miami Airport as soon as shed read the story about Eves memorial service being held today. It had gone to voice mail then, too. Shed left a message, but he hadnt called back. Maybe he didnt want to talk to her, she thought. Why should he? He had loved Eve with every ounce of his being, and he thought Catherine hadnt even cared enough to try to find her when that monster, Doane, had kidnapped her. <br> <i>I cared, Joe. God, how I care. I would have come.</i> <br>She wanted to kill Venable. <br>She might do it if he didnt have an explanation that she could tolerate. <br>And she wanted to release the tears that she had been forcing back since shed read that damn news story. Her friend was dead, and, somehow, she felt as if it was her fault, that if shed known, she might have been able to stop it. Lord, her eyes were stinging. <br>Not here. Not now. <br>When she was alone with her thoughts and memories of Eve and had gotten through this memorial service. <br>Not even a funeral because that crazy bastard had blown them both to bits. <br>She wished with all her heart that Doane was still alive and here, so that she could personally send him straight to hell. <br>But Venable had cheated her out of that pleasure, too, by not bringing her into the picture when Eve needed her most. <br> <i>Damn</i> him. <br>She grabbed her bag as it went around the carousel and headed for the door. <br>*** <br>GOD, LING WAS GORGEOUS, Bradford thought as he pulled his car close to the curb where Catherine Ling was waiting impatiently. She was sleek and sexy, with shoulder-length dark hair and eyes tilted slightly, increasing the exotic magnetism she radiated. He knew she was the illegitimate daughter of an American soldier and a Korean whore who was half-Russian. Shed been born in Saigon but had grown up on the streets of Hong Kong. Hed heard stories about her from other agents, but hed never met her. The stories had been interesting but very, very lethal. She was sharp and independent and likely to run her own show when she was on a mission. Something Venable definitely didnt like but evidently tolerated because she got the job done. Shed been CIA since Venable had picked her up in Hong Kong when she was only fourteen. What was she now? Late twenties? <br>Got everything? He leaned over and opened the passenger door for her. Ill have you at Quinns lake cottage in thirty minutes. I just called Venable, and he said the service had just ended. <br>Dammit, I missed it? Im surprised you got through to him, she said sarcastically. How nice. Hes not been answering my calls. <br>Oops. Im sure thats just a technical error. He was very concerned about you. He hurriedly handed her his computer. Ive pulled up the files on Doane and the catastrophe at the ghost town. Venable was sure youd want to look them over. <br>I would have liked to look them over before the son of a bitch blew her up. She gazed blindly down at the computer. Youve read it. Fill me in. <br>Eve Duncan was kidnapped from her lake cottage home in north Atlanta several days ago. Because shes one of the foremost forensic sculptors in the world, it was assumed at the time that the kidnapper might be one of the nuts or serial killers shed targeted by her work. <br>But if Venable is involved, then thats not why she was killed, Catherine said grimly. Im surprised Eve let him pull her into a CIA mission. <br>She didnt. James Doane had been in a safe house in Goldfork, Colorado, and slipped away from the agent guarding him. When Venable realized he was gone, he thought there might be a possibility of his heading toward Eve Duncan, but he couldnt be sure that <br>Why? Why would he go after Eve? <br>Thats not in the report. Youll have to ask Venable. <br>You can bet I will. Venable fouled up and didnt protect Eve. Is that the truth? <br>Im sure there is an explanation. As I said, he wasnt sure Eve Duncan would be a target. <br>She drew a deep breath. Lets go down another path. Why was Jim Doane in that safe house? Was he a foreign agent? A witness? <br>He shook his head. He was the father of Kevin Relling, who was assassinated five years ago. His son was in Special Forces in the Army and turned very dirty. He was working with al-Qaeda in Pakistan and blocking the hunt for Bin Laden. He also indulged his penchant for raping and killing little girls in whatever city he found himself. He killed the five-year-old daughter of General Tarther in Marseilles because the general was trying to zero in on the al-Qaeda group. <br>Very dirty. Scum. <br>The general went crazy and eventually hired a hit man, Lee Zander, to find and go after Doanes son. Zander killed him and hired a funeral director to cremate the remains. Doane arrived too late to grab anything but his sons skull from the furnace. <br>Okay, then that would be a reason for his kidnapping Eve. Doane wanted Eve to do a reconstruction on the sons skull. Right? <br>I understand that she was doing just that while she was his captive. <br>Then why would the crazy bastard kill her? She was smart. If that job was the ransom he wanted, she wouldnt risk her life by refusing to do a reconstruction. <br>Youll have to ask Venable, he said again. All I know is that Doane took her to a ghost town in the Rio Grande Forest in Colorado. We traced him to an abandoned saloon there. When our units, Quinn, and Jane MacGuire were closing in on him, he set off a charge that blew up the saloon and half the town. He glanced at her. You look Are you okay? <br>No, Im not okay. It shouldnt have happened. Someone should have stopped it. Venable should have stopped it. Her voice fell to a whisper. <i>I</i> should have stopped it. <br>Venable said that you were on a very important mission and that you <br>Screw Venable. Her gaze shifted to the passing scene out the window. Anything else? Are they sure she was in that damn saloon? <br>Yes. Everyone saw Doane take her into the place, and, a few minutes later, our infrared scopes confirmed two people inside. They were still on the scopes when the place blew. <br>DNA? <br>Were working on it, but it may take a long while. There wasnt much left. As I said, the blast practically leveled the town. She was in <br>I dont want the details. Not now. <br>It appeared that Ling was not as tough as he had heard, Bradford thought. Or maybe shes just human, like the rest of us. I hear Eve Duncan was quite a woman. Its a great loss. Everyone from senators to a dozen police chiefs are at that memorial service. <br>They dont know how great a loss, Catherine said. They know the work, not the woman, not the friend. She was silent for a while, forcing herself to read the file. Then she looked up, and asked, How close are we? <br>Five minutes. The service was held outside by the lake at the cottage where she lived with Joe Quinn. He thought shed like it to be at her home. Pretty place. <br>She didnt speak for a moment. I know. Thats where I first met Eve. I stayed with her while she worked on a computer age progression on photos of my son. <br>That was one of the stories about Ling, too. Her son had been held prisoner by a Russian criminal for nine years, and she had never ceased trying to find him. It was only after Eve Duncan had helped her that she had been able to locate him. Im sure you were very grateful. <br>Are you? She looked at him. You have no idea. <br>He pulled his gaze away with some difficulty. Catherine Ling might be as lethal as a striking panther, but he was suddenly finding himself having visions of ladies in distress and knights in shining armor and himself somewhere in the mix. Crazy. It just went to show how right the stories were about the fascination she effortlessly exerted. I know youre upset. If I can help, just call me. He almost bit his tongue. Venable would not like the idea of his moving into Lings camp when she was definitely at odds with him. Though Im sure Venable will straighten everything out. <br>He swung into the grove that Quinn had designated as a parking area. Here we are. Id drive you closer, but there are people milling all over the place. He quickly got out, ran around, and opened the door for her. Everyone is around the cottage down toward the lake. Would you like me to go with you? <br>No. She strode toward the cottage. Id advise you to stay clear. You wouldnt like dodging the flak. <br>He watched her disappear from view, then reluctantly turned away. Catherine Ling might be wrong. He found himself experiencing a strange blankness as if hed been witnessing a fireworks display, and now there was only dark sky. <br>It might be worth dodging a little flak to see her in action. <br>*** <br>CATHERINE SPOTTED VENABLE in the crowd two minutes after she turned the corner of the cottage. <br>He was wearing a dark suit and looked surprisingly formal. He was talking to a man in an NYPD uniform. Then he lifted his gaze and saw her at the edge of the crowd. <br>Wariness. <br>Then he lifted the wineglass in his hand and nodded. <br>Catherine drew a deep breath and tried to smother the anger. If she confronted Venable now, she would make a scene, and that was the last thing she wanted to do at this service honoring Eve. Shed deal with him later. She nodded curtly and turned to look for Joe Quinn. <br>He was standing talking to a tall, white-haired man she vaguely recognized as a congressman. Joe looked pale and unsmiling, but he could obviously still function. She started to make her way toward him. <br>He looked up and saw her. Then, with a word to the congressman, he left him and was walking quickly toward her. Catherine. <br>Joe, I tried to call you. She took a step closer. I didnt know. Believe me, I didnt know anything, or I would have come to <br>I saw that youd called, but I couldnt talk. He took her elbow and was propelling her toward the corner of the house. Ive been surrounded all day. He stopped as he reached an unoccupied stretch of lawn on the side of the cottage. He took a minute to look around and make sure there was no one near. I cant really talk now either, but you have to know, dammit. <br>What are you talking about? I do know. I just found out today in Miami. I cant tell you how <br>Listen. His hands grasped her shoulders. Its not what you think. His voice lowered. Go into the cottage and talk to Kendra Michaels. I told her earlier that you were coming. I knew I couldnt get away from this hullabaloo. <br>Joe, what the hell are you saying? <br>Im saying that though you look terrific in black, you shouldnt go into mourning. He turned away. Ill see you later. Go talk to Kendra. <br>She stared in shock as he walked away. For a moment, she couldnt get her breath. He couldnt mean what she thought he meant. <br>She closed her eyes. Oh, God. Let it be true. Let it all be a nightmarish mistake. <br>Let Eve still be alive. <br>*** <br>CATHERINE ENTERED THE cottage and slammed the door behind her. Kendra Michaels? <br>Yes. Kendra was standing at the window, staring down at the mourners moving from group to group on the lawn bordering the lake. Thats me. And you are? <br>Catherine Ling. She crossed the room and showed her ID. Joe told me to come to see you. Apparently its your job to tell me what the hell is going on here. <br>Kendra nodded. Joe called me and told me you were coming up to ask questions. I just had to verify your ID. There are too many reporters drifting around here at the memorial service. Eve was very well-known. She smiled faintly. Very private, but everyone knew she was phenomenal. <br>Youre damn right she was. Her lips tightened. Were both talking past tense. Yet from what Joe said, Im guessing shes probably very much alive. Her voice was uneven. Dont tell me that hes wrong. I wont have it. <br>Sorry. Joe didnt steer you wrong. Ive just gotten used to playing the sorrowful, regretful friend in the last week, Kendra said. I believe the chances are excellent that Eve is alive. <br>Catherine felt a wave of relief surge through her. Thank God. <br>I cant be absolutely sure, but Id bet every particle of my experience and judgment that she lived through the explosion at that ghost town in Colorado. <br>And why should I trust your judgment? <br>Maybe you shouldnt. Kendra tilted her head. I dont believe you have much to do with trust. <br>Catherines eyes narrowed on her face. Why? Did Eve or Joe tell you about me? <br>No. Just an observation.

He is the winner of eight Eisner Awards and four Harvey Awards, among others. A pioneer in the graphic novel format since the 1980s, Baker helped define and evolve the medium with works such as <i>Nat Turner, Why I Hate Saturn</i>, and <i>King David.</i> Other titles include <i>The Cowboy Wally Show; Truth: Red, White &amp; Black;</i> and <i>Birth of a Nation</i>. Baker has lectured at Dartmouth, Howard University, the Library of Congress, and the School of Visual Arts, and he regularly teaches homeless teens for the City of New York.<br> &nbsp;Grade 10 Up&#x2014;Originally self-published in four installments, <i>Nat Turner</i> follows the dark legacy of the Virginia slave rebellion and subsequent murders of at least 55 white slave owners and their families in 1831. Baker presents a cinematic reel that integrates beautiful sepia-toned panels, newspaper headlines in period font, photographs, and historical texts; most heavily drawn from is the recorded <i>Confessions of Nat Turner</i>. The book begins with the brutal capture, mistreatment, and direct and indirect murder of native Africans by white fortune seekers, with disturbing detail such as the sharks following slave ships for the plentiful corpses thrown overboard. These images, as described by a young Turner to his astonished first-generation relatives, were apparently some of the first in a number of "visions" that the staunchly religious man experienced throughout his short life. Turner is presented as a fiercely intelligent, angry, yet steadfast individual whose potential was dashed in an era of hate and inhumanity. Those characteristics are mirrored in the actions of the slaves' rebellion, in illustrations that are not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach. The ideas brought forth here are sure to ignite debate and discussion, and this book would be a most interesting companion to other studies of antebellum history such as Edward P. Jones's <i>The Known World</i> (HarperCollins, 2003).&#x2014;<i>Shannon Peterson, Kitsap Regional Library, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Recommended for all cozy lovers!&#34; ---Books, Movies, Reviews! Oh My!</p><h2>On the Reliability of the Old Testament</h2><p>For more than two hundred years controversy has raged over the reliability of the Old Testament. Questions about the factuality of its colorful stories of heroes, villains, and kings, for example, have led many critics to see the entire Hebrew Bible as little more than pious fiction. In this fascinating book, noted ancient historian K. A. Kitchen takes strong issue with today's "revisionist" critics and offers a firm foundation for the historicity of the biblical texts.<br><br> In a detailed, comprehensive, and entertaining manner, Kitchen draws on an unprecedented range of historical data from the ancient Near East -- the Bible's own world -- and uses it to soundly reassess both the biblical record and the critics who condemn it. Working back from the latest periods (for which hard evidence is readily available) to the remotest times, Kitchen systematically shows up the many failures of favored arguments against the Bible and marshals pertinent permanent evidence from antiquity's inscriptions and artifacts to demonstrate the basic honesty of the Old Testament writers.&nbsp;<br><br> Enhanced with numerous tables, figures, and maps,&nbsp;<i>On the Reliability of the Old Testament</i>&nbsp;is a must-read for anyone interested in the question of biblical truth.</p><p>Personal and Brunner Professor Emeritus of Egyptology and Honorary Research Fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics, and Oriental Studies, University of Liverpool, England. He is the author of many books on Egyptology, the ancient Near East, and biblical history, including Pharaoh Triumphant: The Life and Times of Ramesses II, Ancient Orient and Old Testament, and The Bible in Its World: The Bible and Archaeology Today.<b><i>Anvil</i></b><br> "Everyone has much to thank Kitchen for in this volume. . . Hopefully, his latest work will preserve another generation of theological students from losing faith in Scripture."<br><br><b><i>Biblical Studies Bulletin</i></b><br> "The scope of this book is nothing less than the entire sweep of Old Testament history, and Kitchen introduces an impressive amount of evidence for the historical reliability of most Old Testament narrative. . . This is a hugely impressive book, packed with detail and energetic argument."<br><br><b><i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society</i></b><br> "Those of us who have benefited from Kitchen's contributions . . . welcome the present work as a culmination of a lifetime of rigorous and unflinching dedication to the task of setting the Old Testament on a solid bedrock of credibility as a historical text. Kitchen's effort is grounded not in dogmatic or theological givens, but rather is the product of painstaking attention to history, archaeology, and critical methodologies."<br><br><b>William W. Hallo</b><br> "After decades of ?minimalism,' it is refreshing to have this first systematic refutation from the opposite position. It provides a step-by-step review of the evidence for biblical history in its Near Eastern context by a leading authority equally at home in Egyptology as in the archaeology, history, and literature of ancient Western Asia. K. A. Kitchen writes with conviction and verve, not sparing those who are ?factually disadvantaged' or who ?do not do their Near Eastern homework.' He takes readers back through time like an archaeologist digging a mound. Even those unwilling to follow him all the way down to the earliest strata will be able to use his lucid expositions and generous documentation to arrive at a balanced view of their own on some of the most burning issues of current biblical scholarship."<br><br><b>K. Lawson Younger Jr.</b><br> "Eminent Egyptologist and ancient Near Eastern scholar Kenneth Kitchen has produced here a tour de force that questions many of the simplistically assumed hypotheses of Old Testament scholarship while at the same time contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the environment in which the Hebrew Bible was composed. Kitchen's lifetime of study of the ancient context of the Old Testament makes this volume a must-read."<br><br><b>Harry A. Hoffner Jr.</b><br> "Why should I be concerned about the historical reliability of the Old Testament? The overriding concern of most Bible readers is ?Are this book's claims about God, Jesus, and the afterlife reliable enough that I should carefully heed and believe what it says?' This is the ?absolute truth' that Kenneth Kitchen in his preface states is beyond the purview of this book. Kitchen's approach is not ?How much historical reliability do I need for my faith?' but ?How much faith do the facts of archaeology (including ancient texts) tell me that I actually have?' In the course of his tour through three pre-Christian millennia, Kitchen approaches his subject with the skill and experience of a bona fide expert and the frankness, honesty, and wit of a Scotsman. His book takes into account the very latest discoveries. There could be no better author for a book like this, an author who for over forty years has read, published, and taught most of the ancient texts he cites. Professor I. Howard Marshall should be congratulated for prompting Kitchen so many years ago to write such a book!"</p><h2>Mary&#39;s Monster: Love, Madness, and How Mary Shelley Created Frankenstein</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Both timely and terrifying.&#x201d; &#x2015;Gregory Macguire, <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>Wicked</i></b></p><p>Pairing free verse with over three hundred pages of black-and-white watercolor illustrations, <i>Mary&#x2019;s Monster </i>is a unique and stunning biography of Mary Shelley, the pregnant teenage runaway who became one of the greatest authors of all time.</p><p>Legend is correct that Mary Shelley began penning <i>Frankenstein</i> in answer to a dare to write a ghost story.

According to Kaiser, successful arts organizations pursue strong programmatic marketing campaigns that compel people to buy tickets, enroll in classes, and so on&#x2015;in short, to participate in the organization&#x2019;s programs. Additionally, they create exciting activities that draw people to the organization as a whole. This institutional marketing creates a sense of enthusiasm that attracts donors, board members, and volunteers. Kaiser calls this group of external supporters the family. When this hidden engine is humming, staff, board, and audience members, artists, and donors feel confidence in the future. Resources are reinvested in more and better art, which is marketed aggressively; as a result, the &#x201c;family&#x201d; continues to grow, providing even more resources. This self-reinforcing cycle underlies the activities of all healthy arts organizations, and the theory behind it can be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal&#x2015;and remedy&#x2015;the problems of troubled ones. This book addresses each element of the cycle in the hope that more arts organizations around the globe&#x2015;from orchestras, theaters, museums, opera companies, and classical and modern dance organizations to service organizations and other not-for-profit cultural institutions&#x2015;will be able to sustain remarkable creativity, pay the bills, and have fun doing so!</p><p>MICHAEL M.

DBT was first developed in the late 1980s by Marsha Linehan as a response to the failure of standard cognitive and behavioral models to effectively treat chronically suicidal clients, and was built on a "dialectical" balance of acceptance and change. The "standard" form of DBT remains highly structured, as was appropriate to its original treatment group. However, today's therapists are increasingly encouraged to combine and integrate empirically supported treatments in a broader form of evidence-based practice that recognizes the importance of therapist expertise and judgment balanced with client needs and preferences. In short, most therapists want to incorporate DBT into their skills portfolio rather than become a specialist. This groundbreaking book makes a compelling case that today's best research evidence supports the adaptation of DBT, and presents the approach as a robust theoretical orientation that can be applied to a wide range of clinical presentations.</p><p><b>Lane D.

Memories of her life still glow in her fading consciousness, but she imagines writing a history of the world. Instead, Moon Tiger is her own history, the life of a strong, independent woman, with its often contentious relations with family and friends. At its center &#x2014; forever frozen in time, the still point of her turning world &#x2014; is the cruelly truncated affair with Tom, a British tank commander whom Claudia knew as a reporter in Egypt during World War II.<br></p><p>Penelope Lively is the author of many prize-winning novels and short-story collections for both adults and children. She has twice been shortlisted for the Booker Prize: once in 1977 for her first novel, The Road to Lichfield, and again in 1984 for According to Mark.

Penelope Lively lives in London.Lively recently won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for this deeply moving, elegantly structured novel. The heroine is Claudia Hampton, an unconventional historian and former war correspondent who lies in a hospital bed dying of cancer. Forced inward, Claudia moves randomly across time and place to reconstruct the strata of her life. But "most lives have their core, their kernel, the vital centre"; Claudia's is the brief, tragic encounter she had in Egypt during the war with Tom Southern, a British tank officer on leave from battle. Tom's voice, along with those of her brother and daughter, joins Claudia's to shape a narrative that is a complex, intricately composed fugue. This haunting evocation of loss is Lively's finest achievement yet.Laurence Hull, Cannon Memorial Lib., Concord, N.C.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>M Archive: After the End of the World</h2><p>Following the innovative collection <i>Spill</i>, Alexis Pauline Gumbs's <i>M Archive</i>&#x2014;the second book in a planned experimental triptych&#x2014;is a series of poetic artifacts that speculatively documents the persistence of Black life following a worldwide cataclysm.

As natural browsers, they have higher mineral requirements than other domestic animals, so diet is a critical element to maintaining optimal livestock health. In <i>Natural Goat Care</i>, consultant Pat Coleby shows how to solve health problems both with natural herbs and medicines and the ultimate cure, bringing the soil into healthy balance. Topics include: correct housing and farming methods; choosing the right livestock; diagnosing health problems; nutritional requirements and feeding practices; vitamins and herbal, homeopathic and natural remedies; psychological needs of goats; breeds &amp; breeding techniques. An invaluable resource for anyone with goats.</p><p>Pat Coleby has been instituting eco-farming techniques in Australia for the last half-century. She practices commercial-scale farming and writes and travels extensively as a lecturer and farm consultant. Early on in her career, she realized that conventional veterinary medicine was far from a cure-all. She recognized that good nutrition is the key to preventing ill health in animals, and her prescriptions of non-invasive, natural remedies resulted in amazing, seemingly miraculous cures in animals whose cases conventional veterinary wisdom would abandon. As word of the success of her natural treatment spread, Pat Coleby quickly became known as an expert on holistic animal care.

Daughter of the Sumerian king Sargon (whose domain lay in what is now southern Iraq), she was a high priestess in the service of the moon-god and moon-goddess, Nanna and Inanna. A number of Enheduanna's hymns have survived on cuneiform-inscribed table is, and her portrait was found on a limestone disc during excavations of the city of Ur.</p><p>The Nin-me-sar-ra, excerpted here, tells the story of a time of political unrest when Enheduanna was cast into exile. Although the priestess appealed first to the god Nanna for help, it was his daughter Inanna who ultimately restored her to her fightful position; while other material about Inanna (see pages 8-10) depicts a goddess of eros and fertility, this hymn praises the moon-goddess primarily for the fierceness that accompanies her power and beauty. The hymn is believed to describe a shift in Inanna's rank to a higher position within the Sumerian pantheon, as well as a shift in power relations between human rulers. It is also the sole representation in this book of the fierce female energy found in spiritual traditions throughout the world. In figures ranging from the Hindu destroyer-goddess Kali to the Hawaiian Pele, we see how this destructive goddess-energy creates a necessary balance--for if the entrance to life is through the maternal feminine, the gates of death (dependent on prior earthly existence) must also he an aspect of engendering female power. There can be no genuine beauty or harmony that does not acknowledge the opposite powers of anger, fierceness, and destruction, the plot of this hymn tells us: a true spirituality includes all of life's aspects, not only those we find pleasing or simple.</p></i><i>from</i>The Hymn to Inanna<p>Lady of all powers, <br>In whom light appears, <br>Radiant one <br>Beloved of Heaven and Earth,<br>Tiara-crowned <br>Priestess of the Highest God, <br>My Lady, you are the guardian <br>Of all greatness. <br>Your hand holds the seven powers: <br>You lift the powers of being, <br>You have hung them over your fingers, <br>You have gathered the many powers, <br>You have clasped them now <br>Like necklaces onto your breast.<br></p><p>Like a dragon, <br>You poisoned the land--<br>When you roared at the earth <br>In your thunder, <br>Nothing green could live. <br>A flood fell from the mountain: <br>You, Inanna, <br>Foremost in Heaven and Earth. <br>Lady riding a beast, <br>You rained fire on the heads of men. <br>Taking your power from the Highest, <br>Following the commands of the Highest, <br>Lady of all the great rites, <br>Who can understand all that is yours?<br></p><p>In the forefront<br>Of the battle, <br>All is struck down by you--<br>O winged Lady, <br>Like a bird <br>You scavenge the land. <br>Like a charging storm <br>You charge, <br>Like a roaring storm <br>You roar, <br>You thunder in thunder, <br>Snort in rampaging winds. <br>Your feet are continually restless. <br>Carrying your harp of sighs, <br>You breathe out the music of mourning.<br></p><p>It was in your service<br>That I first entered<br>The holy temple, <br>I, Enheduanna, <br>The highest priestess. <br>I carried the ritual basket,<br>I chanted your praise. <br>Now I have been cast out<br>To the place of lepers. <br>Day comes, <br>And the brightness<br>Is hidden around me. <br>Shadows cover the light, <br>Drape it in sandstorms.<br>My beautiful mouth knows only confusion.<br>Even my sex is dust.<br></p><p>What once was chanted of Nanna,<br>Let it now be yours-<br>That you are as lofty as Heaven,<br>Let it be known!<br>That you are as wide as the Earth,<br>Let it be known!<br>That you devastate the rebellious,<br>Let it be known!<br>That you roar at the land,<br>Let it be known!<br>That you rain your blows on their heads,<br>Let it be known!<br>That you feast on corpses like a dog,<br>Let it be known!<br>That your glance is lifting toward them,<br>Let it be known!<br>That your glance is like striking lightning,<br>Let it be known!<br>That you are victorious,<br>Let it be known!<br>That this is not said of Nanna,<br>It is said of you-<br>This is your greatness.<br>You alone are the High One.<br></p><p>0 my Lady,<br>Beloved of Heaven,<br>I have told your fury truly.<br>Now that her priestess<br>Has returned to her place,<br>Inanna's heart is restored.<br>The day is auspicious,<br>The priestess is clothed<br>In beautiful robes,<br>In womanly beauty,<br>As if in the light of the rising moon.<br>The gods have appeared<br>In their rightful places, <br>The doorsill of Heaven cries "Hail!"<br>Praise to the destroyer endowed with power,<br>To my Lady enfolded in<br>beauty.

This walking meditation is an archetype, a mystical ritual found in all religious traditions. It quiets the mind and opens the soul. <b>Walking a Sacred Path</b> explores the historical origins of this divine imprint and shares the discoveries of modern day seekers. It shows us the potential of the Labyrinth to inspire change and renewal, and serves as a guide to help us develop the higher level of human awareness we need to survive in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Psychotherapist and priest Dr. Lauren Artress says, "To walk a sacred path is to discover our inner sacred space: that core of feeling that is waiting to have life breathed back into it through symbols, archetypal forms like the labyrinth, rituals, stories, and myths." In her eloquent treatise, she champions the use of the labyrinth as a way of rediscovering one's spiritual center. In <i>Walking a Sacred Path</i>, written in 1995, Artress tells the story of her own spiritual seeking and how a labyrinth came to be built at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Sharing the vision of sacred geometry through the ages, she poetically recounts its wonderful effects. The author is deeply concerned about the environmental and spiritual crisis near the end of the millennium and offers illumination on the path to greater self-understanding, healing, and true spirituality. "Religion," she says, quoting an unknown source, "is for those scared to death of hell. Spirituality is for those who've been there." <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>The <b>Reverend Dr. Laura Artress</b> is Canon for Special Ministeries at San Francisco's Grace Cathedral. She is also the founder of Quest: Grace Cathedral Center for Spiritual Wholeness and the creator of the Labyrinth Project.

That honor belongs to the Founders--the men who pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor for the cause of liberty and independence, and who established the United States. This was a generation without equal, and it deserves to be rescued from the politically correct textbooks, teachers, and professors who want to dismiss the Founders as a cadre of dead, white, sexist, slave-holding males.<br> <br> Now, a clear-sighted conservative historian,<b> Dr. Brion McClanahan</b>, does just that. In <i><b>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers,</b></i> he profiles Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, and other important Founders; traces the key issues of the day and shows how they dealt with them; and in the process details the Founders' deep faith, commitment to the cause of independence, impeccable character, and visionary political ideals.<br> <br> Even better, <i><b>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers</b></i> proves that the Founders had a better understanding of the problems we face today than do our own&nbsp;members of Congress. McClanahan shows that if you want <b>real and relevant insights </b>into the issues of banking, war powers, executive authority, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, states' rights, gun control, judicial activism, trade, and taxes, you'd be better served reading the Founders than you would be watching congressional debates on C-SPAN or reading the New York Times.<br> <br> <i><b>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers</b></i>&nbsp;is a vital guide to restoring a sane, sober, Constitutional sense of responsibility to today's public debates.</p><p>In Praise of <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers</i><p>"Brion McClanahan does far more than merely rehabilitate the Founders.

Rooted in the faith of Israel and the Christian story and vision, Willimon brings a Wesleyan perspective to bear on what may be the hardest thing for people of faith to do: keeping and loving the "Other" as they are - without any need for them to become like us. </p> <p>Emphasizing biblical teaching to receive Others for who they are and their differences as gifts and mysteries bearing the grace of God, Willimon also offers a strong critique of the privileged who all too often rush to speak of reconciliation and evade the injustice of huge inequalities faced by foreigners and strangers - as well as the antagonism the stranger experiences. He identifies concrete, everyday ways persons are formed in welcoming others without annihilating their differences.</p> <p>Rooted in the New Testament understanding of Gentile outsiders grafted into the covenant community, Willimon invites readers to an on-the-ground faith that remembers the God who comes to us again and again through so-called outsiders, strangers, immigrants, and those without status. Beyond welcome, Christians must become &#x201c;other&#x201d; to the world, shaking off the dominant culture&#x2019;s identity and privilege through practices of listening, humility, and understanding. </p> <p>&#x201c;I love Will Willimon, and I love this book. Will writes with prophetic sarcasm, a touch of humor, plenty of self-effacement, and a pastor&#x2019;s heart. And his words will make you laugh, cringe, cry, confess, and repent. This is a very timely book. I urge you, prospective reader, as you read this blurb on the back cover: buy and read it! You&#x2019;ll be grateful you did.&#x201d; &#x2014;Adam Hamilton, senior pastor, The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, Leawood, KS; author of Half Truths <br> <br> &#x201c;This gutsy, biblically rich, theologically searing book by Willimon gigs everybody&#x2019;s sacred cow. Not only is the one whom Christ loves Other but God is Other. The ground beneath us shakes the walls that divide us. If you are holed-up happy with people who look like you, don&#x2019;t read this thing. It will screw up your world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tex Sample, Robert B. and Kathleen Rogers Professor Emeritus of Church and Society, Saint Paul School of Theology, Leawood, KS<br> <br> &#x201c;Timely and prophetic, Willimon&#x2019;s call to love the Other will quickly take hold of your soul, changing your preaching and your life. This book is not just a reminder of our Christian calling to welcome the Other but a call to conversion, a new way of seeing the neighbor and a new way of being in the world God desperately loves.&#x201d; &#x2014;Karoline M.

There, he began building bombs, which he sent to professors and executives to express his disdain for modern society, and to work on his magnum opus, Industrial Society and Its Future, forever known to the world as the Unabomber Manifesto. Responsible for three deaths and more than twenty casualties over two decades, he was finally identifed and apprehended when his brother recognized his writing style while reading the &#39;Unabomber Manifesto.&#39; The piece, written under the pseudonym FC (Freedom Club) was published in the New York Times after his promise to cease the bombing if a major publication printed it in its entirety.</p><p>Theodore John Kaczynski, Ph.D. (a.k.a. Ted Kaczynski) has focused his life&#x2019;s work on sounding the alarm about society&#x2019;s paramount problem: the omnipresent, subjugating, and destructive force of technological progress. His extensive writings articulate a comprehensive critique of the global &#x201c;techno-industrial system&#x201d; and forecast its catastrophic consequences for humankind and the biosphere. His recent works focus on realistic strategies for collective action to alter the current trajectory of society, and avoid unmitigated disaster. Dr. Kaczynski was born in 1942 in Evergreen Park, Illinois. An intellectual prodigy, he attended Harvard at age 16, earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Michigan at 24, and became the youngest professor of mathematics in the history of UC-Berkeley at 25. After two years, Dr. Kaczynski resigned his professorship and moved to a remote wilderness area of western Montana to pursue a life-long ambition of living an autonomous and self-sufficient life off the land, which he did for twenty-five years. Kaczynski has been incarcerated since 1998 in solitary confinement at Federal Prison ADX in Florence, Colorado, after receiving a life sentence for a long-term violent campaign he staged to call world-wide attention to the colossal dangers inherent in technological growth.</p><h2>The Naked Gospel: The Truth You May Never Hear in Church</h2><p>I found myself lying on the floor of my apartment, sobbing for hours on end: &#x201c;God, I&#x2019;m doing everything I&#x2019;m supposed to do, and I still don&#x2019;t feel closer to you.

She lives in a suburb of St. Louis with her family.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><br><p>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re engaged,&#x201d; Special Agent Brenda Manning said. She wore a black pantsuit with a heavy belt that could wrap around her waist and hold the gun at her side. She was FBI and didn&#x2019;t have to worry about concealed carry, so the fact that her gun flashed when her suit jacket flared out, which was every time she moved, wasn&#x2019;t an issue. The gun looked very stark against her white button-down shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; I said. My own gun was at the small of my back, underneath a suit jacket made to hide the gun from the clients at my other job. I&#x2019;d also started getting belt loops added to my skirts so I could wear a belt that could stand up to the weight of a gun and holster. I&#x2019;d come straight from Animators Inc., where the motto was, &#x201c;Where the Living Raise the Dead for a Killing.&#x201d; Bert, our business manager, didn&#x2019;t believe in hiding the fact that raising the dead was a rare talent, and you paid for talent. But lately my job as a U.S. Marshal for the Preternatural Branch had been taking more and more of my time. Like today.</p><p>The other very special agent, Mark Brent, tall, thin, and looking barely old enough to be out of college, was bent over the portable computer they&#x2019;d brought with them, which was sitting on the room&#x2019;s only desk. He was dressed in a suit almost identical to Manning&#x2019;s except his was brown to match his holster, but his gun was still a black bump, stark against his white shirt. We were in the office of our head honcho, Lieutenant Rudolph Storr. Dolph was currently somewhere else, which left me alone with the FBI and Sergeant Zerbrowski. I wasn&#x2019;t sure which was more dangerous to my peace of mind, but I knew Zerbrowski would mouth off more. He was my partner, my friend, he was entitled. I&#x2019;d just met Special Agent Manning, and I didn&#x2019;t owe her my life story.</p><p>&#x201c;The article I read made the proposal sound amazing, like something out of a fairy tale,&#x201d; Manning said. She smoothed her shoulder-length hair back behind one ear and it stayed put, because it was straight as a board. My own curls would never have behaved that well.</p><p>I fought the urge to sigh. If you&#x2019;re a cop and a woman, never date a celebrity; it ruins your reputation for being a hardass. I was a U.S. Marshal, but ever since we&#x2019;d gone public with our engagement I&#x2019;d become Jean-Claude&#x2019;s fianc�e, not Marshal Blake, to most of the women I met, and a lot of the men. I&#x2019;d really had hopes that the FBI would be above such things in the middle of crime-fighting, but apparently not.</p><p>The real problem for me was that the story we told publicly was both true and a lie. Jean-Claude had done the big gesture, but only after he&#x2019;d proposed in the middle of shower sex. It had been spontaneous and wonderful and messy, and very real. I&#x2019;d said yes, which had surprised him, and me. I&#x2019;d figured I just wasn&#x2019;t the marrying kind of girl. He&#x2019;d told me then that we&#x2019;d need to do something to live up to his reputation for the media and the other vampires. They expected their king/president to have a certain flair, and the real proposal was too mundane. I hadn&#x2019;t understood that flair would include a horse-drawn carriage&#x2014;yeah, you heard me; he&#x2019;d actually picked me up in a freaking horse-drawn carriage. If I hadn&#x2019;t already said yes, and loved him to pieces, I&#x2019;d have told him not only no, but hell no. Only true love had gotten me to play along with a proposal so grand that trying to imagine a wedding that topped it sort of scared me.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, Anita is all into that princess stuff, aren&#x2019;t you, Anita?&#x201d; Zerbrowski called from the chair he was half-tipping against the wall. He looked like he&#x2019;d slept in his suit, complete with a stain on his crooked tie. I knew he&#x2019;d left his home freshly washed and tidy, but he was like Pig-Pen from the Peanuts comic: Dirt and mess just seemed to be attracted to him within minutes of his walking out of his house. His salt-and-pepper hair was getting more salt and less pepper, and had grown out enough to be all messy curls, which he kept running his hands through. Only his silver-framed glasses were clean, square and gleaming around his brown eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m all about that princess shit, Zerbrowski,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Agent Manning frowned at both of us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting the idea that I stepped in something. I was just trying to be friendly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you were wanting the princess to talk about how wonderful the prince is, and how he swept her off her feet,&#x201d; Zerbrowski said, &#x201c;but Anita is going to disappoint you like she&#x2019;s disappointed the last dozen women to ask questions about the big romantic gesture.&#x201d;</p><p>I wanted to say, it wasn&#x2019;t a big romantic gesture, it was a freaking epic romantic gesture and I had hated it. Jean-Claude had loved being able to finally pull out all the stops and just do what, apparently, he&#x2019;d wanted to do for years while we dated&#x2014;the whole princely sweep-you-off-your-feet shit. I liked to keep my feet firmly on the ground unless sex was involved, and you can&#x2019;t really have sex in a horse-drawn carriage; it scares the horses. No, we didn&#x2019;t try, because we were on freaking camera the whole time. Apparently, there are now engagement coordinators just like there are wedding coordinators, so of course we had a videographer. It had been all I could do to keep from scowling through all of it, so I&#x2019;d smiled for the camera and so I wouldn&#x2019;t hurt Jean-Claude&#x2019;s feelings, but it&#x2019;s not my real smile, and my eyes in a few frames have that &#x201c;wait until we&#x2019;re alone, mister, we are so talking about this&#x201d; look.</p><p>I decided to appeal to Manning&#x2019;s sisterhood of the badge and said, &#x201c;Sorry, Agent Manning, but ever since the story went live I&#x2019;m getting treated more like Jean-Claude&#x2019;s girlfriend than a marshal, and it&#x2019;s really beginning to bug me.&#x201d;</p><p>Her face went serious. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I hadn&#x2019;t thought about it like that. Years of being one of the guys and building your rep, and I ask you about your engagement first thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen my partner be so girly about anything as meeting you today, Marshal Blake,&#x201d; Brent said as he unbent from hunching over the computer. He smiled and it made him look even younger. He seemed fresh-faced and less jaded than the rest of us. Ah, to be bright and shiny again, when you thought you could actually win the fight against evil.</p><p>Manning looked embarrassed, which isn&#x2019;t something you see often in FBI agents, especially not when you&#x2019;ve just met them.</p><p>&#x201c;Knock it off, Brent,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He grinned at all of us. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;ve worked together for two years, and I&#x2019;ve never seen you squee over anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the horse-drawn carriage,&#x201d; Zerbrowski said. &#x201c;Chicks dig that kind of shit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not this chick,&#x201d; I said, quietly under my breath.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; Manning asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Is the video ready, Agent Brent?&#x201d; I asked, hopeful we could actually do our jobs and leave my personal life out of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said, but then his smile faded around the edges, and I saw the beginnings of the bright and shiny rubbing off. &#x201c;Though after you see it we may all be game to talk about carriages and pretty, pretty princesses.&#x201d;</p><p>It was another first, an FBI agent admitting that something bothered him. For them to admit it out loud, it had to be bad. I suddenly didn&#x2019;t want to see it. I didn&#x2019;t want to add another nightmare to the visuals I had in my head. I was a legal vampire executioner and raised zombies as my psychic talent; I had plenty of scary shit in my head and I so didn&#x2019;t need more, but I stayed in my chair. If Manning and Brent were tough enough to watch it multiple times, I could sit through it once. I couldn&#x2019;t let the other badges think that getting proposed to by the vampire of my dreams made me one bit less tough. I couldn&#x2019;t let myself believe it, either, though a part of me did. How could someone who let a man lead her into a Cinderella carriage carry a gun and execute bad guys? It made even my head hurt, thinking about it.</p><p>Zerbrowski said what I was thinking. &#x201c;I thought the Feds never admitted anything bothered them.&#x201d;</p><p>Agent Brent shook his head and looked tired. Lines showed around his eyes that I hadn&#x2019;t seen before and made me add between three to five years onto his age. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked in law enforcement for six years. I&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d seen it all, until this.&#x201d;</p><p>I did the math in my head and realized he had to be nearly thirty, which was how old I was, but I&#x2019;d used up my shininess years ago.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought this was just another big bad preternatural citizen gone wrong,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like mysteries, Agent Brent. I&#x2019;m only here on this little information out of courtesy to the FBI, and because Lieutenant Storr requested it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We appreciate that, Marshal, and we wouldn&#x2019;t have had you walk into this blind if we didn&#x2019;t feel that the fewer people who know the details, the better off we&#x2019;re going to be,&#x201d; Brent said.</p><p>&#x201c;Awesome,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but the foreplay is getting a little tiresome; there&#x2019;s no one in the room but the four of us, so what is on the video?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you always this cranky?&#x201d; Manning asked.</p><p>Zerbrowski laughed out loud and didn&#x2019;t even try to hold it in. &#x201c;Oh, Agent Manning, this isn&#x2019;t even close to cranky for my partner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We heard that about her, and you&#x2019;re right, Blake. I did come in here expecting the proposal to have softened that reputation. I didn&#x2019;t think I had that much girl left in me, and if I&#x2019;m assuming that it softened you up, then your male colleagues must be making your life . . . difficult.&#x201d;</p><p>It was my turn to laugh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one way of putting it, but honestly it&#x2019;s the whole engaged-to-a-vampire thing that&#x2019;s making some of my fellow officers doubt whose side I&#x2019;m on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vampires are legal citizens now, with all the rights that entails,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Legally, yeah, but prejudice doesn&#x2019;t go away just because a law changes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right about that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;In fact, some at the bureau thought we shouldn&#x2019;t include you in this case because of your proclivity to date the preternatural.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Proclivity, that&#x2019;s polite; so what made you decide to trust me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You still have the highest kill count of any vampire executioner in the United States, and only Denis-Luc St. John has more rogue lycanthrope kills than you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He raises Troll-Hounds; they&#x2019;re the only breed of dog ever raised specifically to hunt supernatural prey. It makes him the king of tracking through wilderness areas, after shapeshifters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you implying that the dogs make him better at the job, or that he&#x2019;s somehow cheating by using them?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;Neither, just a statement of fact.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now that Anita has passed muster, and I&#x2019;m included because I&#x2019;m her friend, show us some skin, agents, or stop teasing,&#x201d; Zerbrowski said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ll see skin,&#x201d; Brent said, and he looked older again, as if this case in particular were rubbing the shine away.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell is on the video, Agent Brent?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Zombie porn,&#x201d; Brent said, and hit the arrow in the middle of the screen.</p></p><h2>Satan Prince of This World - Original Edition</h2><p>William Guy Carr&#39;s last work.

Donald Kagan, one of the world&#x2019;s most respected classical, political, and military historians, here presents a new account of this vicious war of Greek against Greek, Athenian against Spartan. The Peloponnesian War is a magisterial work of history written for general readers, offering a fresh examination of a pivotal moment in Western civilization. With a lively, readable narrative that conveys a richly<br>detailed portrait of a vanished world while honoring its timeless relevance, <b>The Peloponnesian War</b> is a chronicle of the rise and fall of a great empire and of a dark time whose lessons still resonate today.</p><p>Donald Kagan is Sterling Professor of Classics and History at Yale University. His four-volume <b>History of the Peloponnesian War</b> is the leading scholarly work on the subject. He is also the author of many books on ancient and modern topics.INTRODUCTION<p>For almost three decades at the end of the fifth century b.c. the Athenian Empire fought the Spartan Alliance in a terrible war that changed the Greek world and its civilization forever. Only a half-century before its outbreak the united Greeks, led by Sparta and Athens, had fought off an assault by the mighty Persian Empire, preserving their independence by driving Persia's armies and navies out of Europe and recovering the Greek cities on the coasts of Asia Minor from its grasp.</p><p>This astonishing victory opened a proud era of growth, prosperity, and confidence in Greece. The Athenians, especially, flourished, increasing in population and establishing an empire that brought them wealth and glory. Their young democracy came to maturity, bringing political participation, opportunity, and political power even to the lowest class of citizens, and their novel constitution went on to take root in other Greek cities. It was a time of extraordinary cultural achievement, as well, probably unmatched in originality and richness in all of human history. Dramatic poets like Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes raised tragedy and comedy to a level never surpassed. The architects and sculptors who created the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis in Athens, at Olympia, and all over the Greek world powerfully influenced the course of Western art and still do so today. Natural philosophers like Anaxagoras and Democritus used unaided human reason to seek an understanding of the physical world, and such pioneers of moral and political philosophy as Protagoras and Socrates did the same in the realm of human affairs. Hippocrates and his school made great advances in medical science, and Herodotus invented historiography as we understand it today.</p><p>The Peloponnesian War not only brought this remarkable period to an end, but was recognized as a critical turning point even by those who fought it. The great historian Thucydides tells us that he undertook his history as the war began,</p><p>in the belief that it would be great and noteworthy above all the wars that had gone before, inferring this from the fact that both powers were then at their best in preparedness for war in every way, and seeing the rest of the Hellenic people taking sides with one side or the other, some at once, others planning to do so. For this was the greatest upheaval that had ever shaken the Hellenes, extending also to some part of the barbarians, one might say even to a very large part of mankind. (1.1.2)1</p><p>From the perspective of the fifth-century Greeks the Peloponnesian War was legitimately perceived as a world war, causing enormous destruction of life and property, intensifying factional and class hostility, and dividing the Greek states internally and destabilizing their relationship to one another, which ultimately weakened their capacity to resist conquest from outside. It also reversed the tendency toward the growth of democracy. When Athens was powerful and successful, its democratic constitution had a magnetic effect on other states, but its defeat was decisive in the political development of Greece, sending it in the direction of oligarchy.</p><p>The Peloponnesian War was also a conflict of unprecedented brutality, violating even the harsh code that had previously governed Greek warfare and breaking through the thin line that separates civilization from savagery. Anger, frustration, and the desire for vengeance increased as the fighting dragged on, resulting in a progression of atrocities that included maiming and killing captured opponents; throwing them into pits to die of thirst, starvation, and exposure; and hurling them into the sea to drown. Bands of marauders murdered innocent children. Entire cities were destroyed, their men killed, their women and children sold as slaves. On the island of Corcyra, now called Corfu, the victorious faction in a civil war brought on by the larger struggle butchered their fellow citizens for a full week: "Sons were killed by their father, and suppliants dragged from the altar or slain upon it" (3.81.2-5).</p><p>As the violence spread it brought a collapse in the habits, institutions, beliefs, and restraints that are the foundations of civilized life. The meanings of words changed to suit the bellicosity: "Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness." Religion lost its restraining power, "but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high reputation." Truth and honor disappeared, "and society became divided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow" (3.82.1, 8; 3.83.1). Such was the conflict that inspired Thucydides' mordant observations on the character of war as "a savage schoolmaster that brings the characters of most people down to the level of their current circumstances" (3.82.2).</p><p>Although the Peloponnesian War ended more than twenty-four hundred years ago it has continued to fascinate readers of every subsequent age. Writers have used it to illuminate the First World War, most frequently to help explain its causes, but its greatest influence as an analytical tool may have come during the Cold War, which dominated the second half of the twentieth century, and which likewise witnessed a world divided into two great power blocs, each under a powerful leader. Generals, diplomats, statesmen, and scholars alike have compared the conditions that led to the Greek war with the rivalry between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.</p><p>But the story of what actually took place two and a half millennia in the past, and its deeper meaning, are ultimately not easy to grasp. By far the most important source of our knowledge is the history written by the war's contemporary and participant Thucydides. His work is justly admired as a masterpiece of historical writing and hailed for its wisdom about the nature of war, international relations, and mass psychology. It has also come to be regarded as a foundation stone of historical method and political philosophy. It is not, however, completely satisfactory as a chronicle of the war and all that the war can teach us. Its most obvious shortcoming is that it is incomplete, stopping in midsentence seven years before the war's end. For an account of the final part of the conflict we must rely on writers of much less talent and with little or no direct knowledge of events. At the very least, a modern treatment of accessible scope is needed to make sense of the conclusion of the war.</p><p>But even the period treated by Thucydides requires illumination if the modern reader is to have the fullest understanding of its military, political, and social complexities. The works of other ancient writers and contemporary inscriptions discovered and studied in the last two centuries have filled gaps and have sometimes raised questions about the story as Thucydides tells it. Finally, any satisfactory history of the war also demands a critical look at Thucydides himself. His was an extraordinary and original mind, and more than any other historian in antiquity he placed the highest value on accuracy and objectivity. We must not forget, however, that he was also a human being with human emotions and foibles. In the original Greek his style is often very compressed and difficult to understand, so that any translation is by necessity an interpretation. The very fact that he was a participant in the events, moreover, influenced his judgments in ways that must be prudently evaluated. Simply accepting his interpretations uncritically would be as limiting as accepting without question Winston Churchill's histories and his understanding of the two world wars in which he played so important a role.</p><p>In this book I attempt a new history of the Peloponnesian War designed to meet the needs of readers in the twenty-first century. It is based on the scholarship employed in my four volumes on the war aimed chiefly at a scholarly audience,2 but my goal here is a readable narrative in a single volume to be read by the general reader for pleasure and to gain the wisdom that so many have sought in studying this war. I have avoided making comparisons between events in it and those in later history, although many leap to mind, in the hope that an uninterrupted account will better allow readers to draw their own conclusions.</p><p>I undertake this project after so many years because I believe, more than ever, that the story of the Peloponnesian War is a powerful tale that may be read as an extraordinary human tragedy, recounting the rise and fall of a great empire, the clash between two very different societies and ways of life, the interplay of intelligence and chance in human affairs, and the role of brilliantly gifted individuals, as well as masses of people in determining the course of events while subject to the limitations imposed upon them by nature, by fortune, and by one another. I hope to demonstrate, also, that a study of the Peloponnesian War is a source of wisdom about the behavior of human beings under the enormous pressures imposed by war, plague, and civil strife, and about the potentialities of leadership and the limits within which it must inevitably operate.</p><p>1Adapted from the translation of Richard Crawley (Modern Library, New York, 1951).

Having demystified the equation, Bodanis explains its science and brings it to life historically, making clear the astonishing array of discoveries and consequences it made possible. It would prove to be a beacon throughout the twentieth century, important to Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the structure of the atom, Enrico Fermi, who probed the nucleus, and Lise Meitner, who finally understood how atoms could be split wide open. And it has come to inform our daily lives, governing everything from the atomic bomb to a television's cathode-ray tube to the carbon dating of prehistoric paintings.</p></p><p>E=mc2. Just about everyone has at least heard of Albert Einstein's formulation of 1905, which came into the world as something of an afterthought. But far fewer can explain his insightful linkage of energy to mass. David Bodanis offers an easily grasped gloss on the equation. Mass, he writes, "is simply the ultimate type of condensed or concentrated energy," whereas energy "is what billows out as an alternate form of mass under the right circumstances."<p> Just what those circumstances are occupies much of Bodanis's book, which pays homage to Einstein and, just as important, to predecessors such as Maxwell, Faraday, and Lavoisier, who are not as well known as Einstein today. Balancing writerly energy and scholarly weight, Bodanis offers a primer in modern physics and cosmology, explaining that the universe today is an expression of mass that will, in some vastly distant future, one day slide back to the energy side of the equation, replacing the "dominion of matter" with "a great stillness"--a vision that is at once lovely and profoundly frightening.</p><p> Without sliding into easy psychobiography, Bodanis explores other circumstances as well; namely, Einstein's background and character, which combined with a sterling intelligence to afford him an idiosyncratic view of the way things work--a view that would change the world. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Botanical Portraits with Colored Pencils</h2><p>A successfully executed work of botanical art is an exacting blend of scientific accuracy and aesthetic beauty. This lavishly illustrated volume offers practical, step-by-step instruction for creating professional quality colored pencil illustrations of flowers, foliage, fruits, and other botanical subjects.

That&#x2019;s what happened to me when I picked up <em>User Friendly</em>, a fascinating book about the history of user-experience design. The book starts off with a bang (well, almost a bang; thankfully, it wasn&#x2019;t) with a discussion of the Three Mile Island disaster. As it turns out, the designers of those famous nuclear reactors used most of their brainpower to design the actual reactors and much less on designing the control room. When things started going south, people got confused&#x2014;so things continued farther south. And it could have been easily avoided. <em>User Friendly</em> hinges on the idea that humans eventually figured out they needed to design things with humans in mind. In essence, machines needed to anticipate how humans would interact with them. As the authors trace these changes and the people behind them, from the Great Depression to WWII to the digital era, you will sense lightbulbs going off in your mind the entire way. This is a fun read, an informative read.

Wells and the Campaign Against Lynching</h2><p><p>Heralded as a landmark achievement upon publication, <em>Ida: A Sword Among Lions</em> is a sweeping narrative about a country and a crusader embroiled in the struggle against lynching&#x2014;a practice that imperiled not only the lives of black men and women, but also a nation based on law and riven by race. </p><p>At the center of the national drama is Ida B. Wells (1862-1931). Born to slaves in Mississippi, Wells began her activist career by refusing to leave a first-class ladies' car on a Memphis railway and rose to lead the nation's first campaign against lynching. For Wells, the key to the rise in violence was embedded in attitudes not only about black men, but also about women and sexuality. Her independent perspective and percussive personality gained her encomiums as a hero&#x2014;as well as aspersions on her character and threats of death. Exiled from the South by 1892, Wells subsequently took her campaign across the country and throughout the British Isles before she married and settled in Chicago. There she continued her activism as a journalist, suffragist, and independent candidate in the rough-and-tumble world of the Windy City's politics.</p><p>With meticulous research and vivid rendering of her subject, Giddings also provides compelling portraits of twentieth-century progressive luminaries, blacks and whites who worked with Wells during some of the most tumultuous periods in American history.

It&#x2019;s a terrific stitch dictionary for stitchers wishing to increase their stitching repertoire.<br><br>As the title suggests, this is the second A-Z book on embroidery stitches. The first one, A-Z of Embroidery Stitches, is excellent, too, but I especially like this second one because it delves into stitch combinations, variations, and so forth that are not as commonly seen as those stitches found in the first book.<br><br>A-Z of Embroidery Stitches 2 features over 145 embroidery stitches, variations, and combinations, each shown in detail with step-by-step photos of the actual stitch in progress. The book begins with a long index of the stitches included within! Before the stitching instructions begin, in the front of the book you&#x2019;ll find some excellent information for the embroiderer. For example, there are several pages devoted to needles used in embroidery, including what types are used for what, and a page of actual sized photos of the various types of needles. How many times have you wondered if you&#x2019;re using the right&#x201d; needle for your work? Or which needle to choose before you start? This is a great resource that helps answer those questions!<br><br>There&#x2019;s a good section on using an embroidery hoop, binding a hoop, and keeping your work clean excellent information for beginners and beyond. But the real meat&#x201d; of the book, of course, is in the instructions. The step-by-step photos of the various stitches are what make the book perfect for learning. Besides regular surface embroidery stitches, you&#x2019;ll find some ribbon embroidery techniques included throughout the book and in this particular book, you&#x2019;ll find lots of interesting composite stitches, filling stitches, and stitch variations. If you&#x2019;re looking for a good stitch dictionary that will allow you to add some variety to your stitches, you can&#x2019;t go wrong with this book.<br></p><h2>Crime Scene Investigations: Real-Life Science Labs For Grades 6-12</h2><p>This unique resource offers activities in earth, life, and physical science as well as science inquiry and technology.

"God did not die just to save us from the consequences of a bad past or past failure, but to 'clear the decks' for divine action in our lives." The Saving Life of Christ contains a warning that our response to Jesus Christ will determine our condition "in the sights of God . . . redeemed or condemned." The Mystery of Godliness offers old and new considerations about the nature of godliness in thought-provoking discussions such as How to Do the Impossible and How Much are You Worth?</p></p><p>Major W.

This book for young people paints a vivid portrait of a remarkable woman who overcame every obstacle with faith, hope, perseverance-- and a healthy dose of ambition.In this 29th book in the acclaimed Vision Books series for youth, Louis de Wohl, known for his masterful storytelling, describes the amazing events that led to the conversion of Helena and the rise to power of her son. He also recounts the vision Constantine experienced on the eve of a pivotal battle and his subsequent legalization of Christianity in the fourth century.The story dramatically concludes with St. Helena&#39;s final accomplishment- her dangerous and miraculous expedition to the Holy Land.</p><p><b>Louis de Wohl</b>&nbsp;was a highly acclaimed novelist who wrote numerous best selling historical novels on lives of the saints, many being made into films. Sixteen of his books were made into films.

Erasmo Leiva here acts as our guide, showing Matthew's prose to be not terse so much as economical--astoundingly so given its depth. The lay reader can derive great profit from reading this. Each short meditation comments on a verse or two, pointing to some facet of the text not immediately apparent. <p>Leiva's work is scholarly but eminently approachable by the non-technical reader. The tone is very much gustate et videte, quoniam suavis est Dominus [taste and see how good the Lord is]-as it is friend, come up higher! The goal of the book is to help the reader experience the heat of the divine heart/the light of the divine Word. </p><p>Leiva points to Matthew's gospel as being deeply ecclesial because it is first Christological. He comments on the Greek text, demonstrating to the reader nuances in the text that defy translation into English without serious revision of the text. Leiva uses linguistic analysis to aid the non-Greek reader with the literal meaning of the text; numerous quotes from the Fathers and the liturgy of the church demonstrate the way the Tradition has lived and read the Word of God. His theological reflection vivifies doctrine by seeking its roots in the words and actions of Jesus.</p></p><p>Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis obtained his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Theology from Emory University.

Zen Master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh argues eloquently for their applicability in our daily lives and on a global scale. Nhat Hanh discusses the value and meaning of each precept, offering insights into the role that it could play in our changing society.<br><br>Thich Nhat Hanh calls the trainings a "diet for a mindful society." With this book he offers a Buddhist contribution to the current thinking on how we can come together to define secular, moral guidelines that will allow us to explore and sustain a sane, compassionate, and healthy way of living. The Five Mindfulness Trainings offer a path to restoring meaning and value in our world, whether called virtues, ethics, moral conduct, or precepts they are guidelines for living without bringing harm to others.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today. His best-selling books include <i>Happiness</i> and <i>Peace Is Every Step</i>. He lives in Plum Village in southwest France, where he gardens, writes, and teaches the art of mindful living.FROM THE INTRODUCTION<br><br>There is a deep malaise in society. When a young person goes out in the world without any help or protection, he absorbs violence, hatred, fear, and insecurity every day, and eventually he gets sick. Our conversations, TV programs, advertisements, newspapers, and magazines all water the seeds of suffering in young people, and in not-so-young people as well. We feel a kind of vacuum in ourselves, and we try to fill it by eating, reading, talking, smoking, drinking, watching TV, going to the movies, or even overworking. Taking refuge in these things only makes us feel hungrier and less satisfied, and we want to ingest even more. We need some guidelines, some preventive medicine, to protect ourselves, so we can become healthy again. We have to find a cure for our illness. We have to find something that is good, beautiful, and true in which we can take refuge.<br><br>When we drive a car, we are expected to observe certain rules so that we do not have an accident. Two thousand five hundred years ago, the Buddha offered certain guidelines to his lay students to help them live peaceful, wholesome, and happy lives. They were the Five Mindfulness Trainings, and at the foundation of each of these mindfulness trainings is mindfulness. With mindfulness, we are aware of what is going on in our bodies, our feelings, our minds, and the world, and we avoid doing harm to ourselves and others. Mindfulness protects us, our families, and our society, and ensures a safe and happy present and a safe and happy future.<br><br>In Buddhism, mindfulness trainings, concentration, and insight always go together. It is impossible to speak of one without the other two. This is called the Threefold Training: sila, the practice of the mindfulness trainings; <i>samadhi,</i> the practice of concentration; and <i>prajna</i>, the practice of insight. Mindfulness Trainings, concentration, and insight "inter-are." Practicing the mindfulness trainings brings about concentration; and concentration is needed for insight. Mindfulness is the ground for concentration; concentration allows us to look deeply; and insight is the fruit of looking deeply. When we are mindful, we can see that by refraining from doing "this," we prevent "that" from happening. This kind of insight is not imposed on us by an outside authority. It is the fruit of our own observation. Practicing the mindfulness trainings, therefore, helps us be more calm and concentrated and brings more insight and enlightenment, which makes our practice of the mindfulness trainings more solid. The three are intertwined; each helps the other two, and all three bring us closer to final liberation. They prevent us from falling back into illusion and suffering.<br><br>The Five Mindfulness Trainings are love itself. To love is to understand, protect, and bring well-being to the object of our love. The practice of the trainings accomplishes this. We protect ourselves and we protect each other.<br>EXCERPT FROM THE COMMENTARIES:<br><br>THE FIRST MINDFULNESS TRAINING<br><br>Reverence for Life<br><br>Life is precious. It is everywhere, inside us and all around us; it has so many forms.<br><br>The First Mindfulness Training is born from the awareness that lives everywhere are being destroyed. We see the suffering caused by the destruction of life, and we vow to cultivate compassion and use it as a source of energy for the protection of people, animals, plants, and minerals. The First Mindfulness Training is a training of compassion, karuna&#x2014;the ability to remove suffering and transform it. When we see suffering, compassion is born in us.<br><br>It is important for us to stay in touch with the suffering of the world. We need to nourish that awareness through many means&#x2014;sounds, images, direct contact, visits, and so on&#x2014;in order to keep compassion alive in us. But we must be careful not to take in too much. Any remedy must be taken in the proper dosage. We need to stay in touch with suffering only to the extent that we will not forget, so that compassion will flow within us and be a source of energy for our actions. If we use anger at injustice as the source for our energy, we may do something harmful, something that we will later regret. According to Buddhism, compassion is the only source of energy that is useful and safe. With compassion, your energy is born from insight; it is not blind energy.<br><br>We humans are made entirely of nonhuman elements, such as plants, minerals, earth, clouds, and sunshine. For our practice to be deep and true, we must include the ecosystem. If the environment is destroyed, humans will be destroyed, too. Protecting human life is not possible without also protecting the lives of animals, plants, and minerals. The Diamond Sutra teaches us that it is impossible to distinguish between sentient and non-sentient beings. This is one of many ancient Buddhist texts that teach deep ecology. Every Buddhist practitioner should be a protector of the environment. Minerals have their own lives, too. In Buddhist monasteries, we chant, "Both sentient and non-sentient beings will realize full enlightenment." The First Mindfulness Training is the practice of protecting all lives, including the lives of minerals.<br><br>But not to kill is not enough. We must also learn ways to prevent others from killing. We cannot say, "I am not responsible. They did it. My hands are clean." If you were in Germany during the time of the Nazis, you could not say, "They did it. I did not." If, during the Gulf War, you did not say or do anything to try to stop the killing, you were not practicing this training. Even if what you said or did failed to stop the war, what is important is that you tried, using your insight and compassion. <br><br>It is not just by not killing with your body that you observe the First Mindfulness Training. If in your thinking you allow the killing to go on, you also break this training. We must be determined not to condone killing, even in our minds. According to the Buddha, the mind is the base of all actions. It is most dangerous to kill in the mind. When you believe, for example, that yours is the only way for humankind and that everyone who follows another way is your enemy, millions of people could be killed because of that idea.<br><br>To practice nonviolence, first of all we have to practice it within ourselves. In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a certain amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our response to things will be more or less nonviolent. Even if we take pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have to acknowledge that the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being vegetarian, we are going in the direction of nonviolence. If we want to head north, we can use the North Star to guide us, but it is impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed in that direction.<br><br>Life is so precious, yet in our daily lives we are usually carried away by our forgetfulness, anger, and worries, or we're lost in the past, unable to touch life in the present moment. When we are truly alive, everything we do or touch is a miracle. To practice mindfulness is to return to life in the present moment. The practice of the First Mindfulness Training is a celebration of reverence for life. When we appreciate and honor the beauty of life, we will do everything in our power to protect all life.<br></p><h2>Moonlight Cove (A Chesapeake Shores Novel, 6)</h2><p><br><br>Jess O'Brien has overcome a lot&#x2014;the challenges of attention deficit disorder, the near bankruptcy of her beloved Inn at Eagle Point and her self-perception as a screwup in a family of overachievers. Now she's ready to share the future with a man. Her friends persuade her to join a dating service&#x2014;but she gets no takers! Which is fine with her childhood friend, psychologist Will Lincoln, who's already chosen the perfect man for Jess: himself.<br><br>Will has loved Jess practically forever. He knows her faults and her strengths. But for all Will's sincerity <em>and</em> charm, Jess fears he views her as some psychological case study. With her family and the town of Chesapeake Shores behind him, Will finally makes his case. But is it enough to convince Jess to take the risk of a lifetime?<br><br></p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>"I have an idea," Laila Riley announced when she and Connie Collins turned up in Jess O'Brien's office at The Inn at Eagle Point on a Saturday night.<br><br>There was a twinkle in her eye that immediately made Jess nervous about what her friends had in mind. "Is it going to get us arrested?" she inquired suspiciously. Not that she was unwilling to take the risk, but she would like to know about the possibility in advance, calculate the odds and have a backup plan.<br><br>Laila grinned. "If there were anyone interesting working for the sheriff's department, we'd consider it, but no. This is just doing something outside the box, something none of us would ever consider unless we all decided to do it together."<br><br>"Do I dare ask?" Jess wondered.<br><br>"Online dating," Connie revealed. The lack of enthusiasm in her voice suggested that this had been Laila's idea and that Connie had only agreed because of the same boredom that had been affecting Jess's mood recently.<br><br>Jess, however, wasn't quite that desperate. "You can't be serious."<br><br>"Oh, but we are," Laila confirmed.<br><br>Jess studied the two women who'd invaded her office on a night of the week when most attractive, intelligent women should have been out on dates. Connie and Laila were related to her indirectly by the marriages of their siblings to hers. They were friends by choice despite the differences in their ages.<br><br>Connie was the forty-one-year-old single mother of a teen who'd recently left for college. Her younger brother, Jake, was married to Jess's sister, Bree. Laila was the thirty-six-year-old manager of the local bank and younger sister of Trace, who was married to Abby, Jess's oldest sister. Jess, at thirty, was the youngest. At times it seemed as if everyone in Chesapeake Shores was related to an O'Brien one way or another.<br><br>"Okay, now, let's think about this," Laila said, making herself at home by pouring a glass of tea from the ever-present pitcher on Jess's desk. "What are you doing tonight? I mean, seriously, here you are in your office when you should be out on the town, right?"<br><br>Jess glanced at the ever-present mound of paperwork on her desk. It was the worst part of her job. She was beginning to see Laila's point.<br><br>"And does that make one bit of sense to you?" Laila pressed. "What is wrong with the men in this town that the three of us are alone on a Saturday night? We obviously need to broaden our horizons. Put ourselves out there. Stir things up."<br><br>"And find some geographically unsuitable men who'll never be around?" Jess replied. "Seems counterproductive to me."<br><br>"I thought the same thing at first," Connie said, beckoning for her own glass of tea. Laila poured it and handed it to her. "But the sad truth is that boredom has made me more open-minded. For the longest time I couldn't wait until my daughter was grown and off to college, but now that Jenny's actually gone, the house feels so empty I can hardly stand it."<br><br>"And I've been mind-numbingly bored ever since Dave and I broke up three years ago, which is saying something, since dating him was about as stimulating as watching grass grow," Laila said. She sat up straighter. "Online dating is the perfect way to change the status quo. It's trendy. It'll be fun."<br><br>Jess remained unconvinced. She turned to Connie, who was known for being sensible. "Are you really in favor of this?"<br><br>Connie shrugged. "I can see some advantages."<br><br>"Geographically undesirable," Jess repeated with emphasis.<br><br>"Not a problem," Laila insisted. "It's a new local service. These men are all right around here."<br><br>Jess couldn't quite wrap her mind around either the idea or the fact that Connie was willing, if not eager, to try online dating. Looking her in the eye, Jess began, "But I thought..." Her voice trailed off. She wasn't supposed to know that sparks had been flying between Connie and Jess's uncle, Thomas O'Brien. Her brothers Connor and Kevin both had sworn her to secrecy. She sighed. "Never mind."<br><br>Connie studied her with suspicion, but since it was a kettle of fish she clearly didn't want to dive into, she remained silent.<br><br>Laila, seemingly unaware of the undercurrents, jumped back in. "It's perfect, don't you think?" she asked excitedly.<br><br>"Are there any single men around here we don't already know?" Jess asked, still skeptical. "Isn't that precisely why we're sitting here on a weekend without dates?"<br><br>"The region does extend beyond the town limits," Connie conceded.<br><br>"It includes Annapolis," Laila explained, pulling a brochure from her pocket and handing it to Jess. "See, Lunch by the Bay. Doesn't that sound lovely? And that's all we'd be committing to, an occasional lunch with someone new. It has to beat waiting around to be noticed in the bar at Brady's. If I spend any more time in there, Dillon's threatened to name a barstool after me."<br><br>"At least you'd have a lasting legacy of your life in Chesapeake Shores," Jess teased. "Much better than having your picture on the wall of that stodgy old bank your family owns and that you're so attached to."<br><br>"Make fun of me all you want, but I really think we should do this," Laila insisted. "We're intelligent, attractive women. We deserve to spend time with exciting, successful men who aren't related to us."<br><br>"And I for one am tired of the Saturday night pity dinners at Jake and Bree's," Connie added with a shudder. "Ever since Jenny left, they expect me to come there and coo over the new baby. She's a cutie, but that is not how I see myself spending Saturday nights for the next who-knows-how-many years."<br><br>"I've had my share of those dinners," Jess agreed, "but at least I get passed off from Bree to Abby to Kevin and now even Connor."<br><br>"I don't even get the pity dinners," Laila said. "Trace and Abby just count on me to babysit the twins. If I'm not married soon, they'll probably move me in and make me a full-time nanny."<br><br>"You have a career," Jess reminded her. "I'm pretty sure you can maintain an independent lifestyle."<br><br>"Independence sucks," Laila declared.<br><br>"Amen," Connie added. "Not that I want some man controlling what I do with my life," she said emphatically, "but it would be nice to cuddle with someone in front of the fire at night."<br><br>"Say what you really mean," Jess said. "You want sex."<br><br>Connie sighed. "Don't we all?"<br><br>"So, are we going to do this?" Laila asked, tapping the brochure.<br><br>Though she was hardly known for her caution, Jess couldn't seem to keep herself from asking, "But what do we know about this company?"<br><br>"Only what it says in the brochure," Laila replied, glancing at the back page. "It promises discreet matches, handled by a psychologist who's been working with single clients for years. He's developed criteria for making sure that people have the same goals and values." She set down the brochure and regarded them earnestly. "Come on, you guys. What do we have to lose? If the dates are awful, we can laugh about them later over drinks at Brady's."<br><br>"I'm in," Connie said at once. "Jess?"<br><br>Jess glanced at the paperwork on her desk. It wasn't going anywhere. "What the heck! I'm in."<br><br>She turned and flipped on her computer, checked the link to the company's website and found it. "Nice design," she said approvingly.<br><br>"See, it looks perfectly respectable," Connie noted.<br><br>"And I love the picture," Laila said. "I'm pretty sure it was taken right on Shore Road. See, there's the town fishing pier off to the left."<br><br>"Aren't you worried that we could wind up being paired off with someone we already know, even someone we used to date?" Jess asked. "That could be humiliating."<br><br>"Or it could make us take another look at him," Connie responded, her expression thoughtful. "After all, if an expert thought we'd be a match, maybe we were selling the other person short."<br><br>"Or maybe the expert isn't all that smart," Jess countered.<br><br>Still, when the form for signing up appeared on the screen, she was the first one to fill it out. She considered the temptation to fake her replies just to see what might happen, but Connie and Laila forestalled her.<br><br>"You have to take this seriously," Connie scolded.<br><br>"We're expecting a computer and some so-called expert to do what we haven't been able to do on our own," Jess replied. "And you want me to take it seriously?"<br><br>"/ do," Connie said. "Because this could be my last chance."<br><br>"It is not going to be your last chance," Laila said fiercely. "If you're going to look at it like that, Connie, then maybe you shouldn't do it. Desperation is never smart when it comes to meeting men. We're doing this for laughs and a few free lunches, that's it. We need to keep our expectations low and just concentrate on having fun."<br><br>Jess nodded. Connie didn't look entirely convinced, but when Jess's form was complete, Connie immediately nudged her aside and took her place in front of the computer. Laila followed.<br><br>When the last form had been sent in, they exchanged a look.<br><br>"I need a drink," Jess said. "I'm in," Laila said.<br><br>Connie nodded agreement. "I think I'd better make mine a double."<br><br>One of the few things that hadn't changed since Jake had married Bree was that he, Mack Franklin and Will Lincoln continued to have lunch every day at Sally's. The lunches had started when Jake needed support after he and Bree had split up a few years ago. Now that they were together again and happily married, the lunch tradition had become an occasion for the three men to keep their friendship grounded. Will counted on these two men more than either of them probably realized.<br><br>As a psychologist, Will spent his days listening to other people's problems, but he didn't really have anyone other than Jake and Mack to listen to his. Even though the three of them knew just about everything concerning each other's lives, there was one thing Will had been keeping from them for a while now: his new business, Lunch by the Bay.<br><br>The dating service had been born out of frustration. He spent way too much of his time counseling singles on the relationships in their lives and way too little of his time nurturing any kind of relationship of his own. The name of the company, which had come to him in the middle of a lonely night, was meant to be ironic, if only to him. As much as he loved getting together with his buddies, he thought it was past time to start having lunch with people who wore dresses and perfume. Jake might occasionally smell like roses, but it was only after he'd spent a morning planting rose bushes for one of his many landscaping clients. It was hardly the same.<br><br>It was also, Will thought, way past time to stop carrying the torch for Jess O'Brien, youngest sister of his friends Kevin and Connor O'Brien. Over the years Jess had had ample opportunities to indicate even a whiff of interest in Will, but she mostly treated him like an especially annoying big brother.<br><br>Worse, since he'd become a psychologist, she regularly accused him of analyzing her because she had ADD. She didn't trust his slightest bit of attention, fully expecting him to turn her into some professional case study. None of his denials had gotten her off that ridiculous tangent. Since they were thrown together a lot, her suspicion made most of their encounters awkward and testy.<br><br>Which meant it was time to move on once and for all, no easy task in a town with a population under five thousand except when tourists and weekenders filled it during the spring and summer. Lunch by the Bay had been created not only to fill a gap in the Chesapeake Shores social scene, but also to save him from growing old alone.<br><br>He explained all of this to Jake and Mack, who stared at him as if he'd suddenly sprouted antlers.<br><br>"You're starting a dating website?" Mack repeated, as if checking the accuracy of his hearing.<br><br>"Exactly," Will said. "If you weren't so busy <em>not </em>dating Susie, I'd encourage you to sign up. You're one of the town's most eligible bachelors."<br><br>"You intend to use this site yourself?" Jake said, looking puzzled. "I thought you were seeing some psychologist who bought a summer house here."<br><br>"I was," Will said. "Two years ago. It didn't work out, which you would know if you ever paid attention to a thing I tell you."<br><br>"But you've been dating," Jake persisted. "I'm not imagining that. You've blown us off to go on dates."<br><br>"What can I say?" Will said with a shrug. "None of them have amounted to anything."<br><br>"I suppose it makes sense," Mack said eventually. "Susie is always grumbling about the dearth of available men in town."<br><br>Jake barely managed to swallow a chuckle.<br><br>Mack scowled at him. "What?"<br><br>"I thought she had you," Jake responded.<br><br>"We're not dating," Mack repeated for the umpteenth unbelievable time.<br><br>"And yet neither of you seems to be looking for anyone else," Will pointed out. "If I'm wrong and you are open to other possibilities, I can sign you right up on the new website. You're an ex-jock and a semi-famous sports columnist. I'll have you matched up with someone new by the end of the week."<br><br>Jake regarded him incredulously. "You already have clients?"<br><br>"About thirty so far," Will confirmed.<br><br>"Anyone we know?" Mack asked, then frowned. "Susie, for instance?" There was a discernible hitch in his voice when he asked, proving that there was more to that relationship than he wanted to acknowledge.<br><br>"I'm not at liberty to say," Will told him.<br><br>"When did you start this company?" Jake asked.<br><br>"Three weeks ago officially, though I'd been working out the criteria for matching people for a while. I finally incorporated, then put out a few brochures around town. I had no idea what to expect, but when the clients started signing up, I figured I ought to tell you all about it before you heard about it from another source. Someone's bound to figure out I'm the professional psychologist behind it. After all, there aren't that many of us in the area."<br><br>"So you're doing this to make money?" Mack said, clearly still trying to grasp his motivation. Before Susie, Mack had had absolutely no difficulty attracting single women, so he didn't understand Will's frustration.<br><br>"It could be a gold mine, yes, but that wasn't really my motivation," Will insisted. "I think of it more as a community service."<br><br>"Nice spin," Jake commented wryly. "You've already admitted that you're doing this so you can meet women. Couldn't you just have hung out at Brady's more often?"<br><br>Will shook his head. "That wasn't really working for me."<br><br>"What about church? I hear a lot of men meet women at church," Mack said. "Come to think of it, if I'd known you were this desperate, I could have asked Susie to fix you up. She has a bunch of girlfriends."<br><br>"I'm not desperate," Will said, offended by the characterization. "I'm being proactive."<br><br>Jake and Mack exchanged a glance. It was Jake who dared to ask, "What about Jess?"<br><br>Will stilled. "What about her?"<br><br>"You've always been crazy about her," Jake said.<br><br></p><h2>The True Power of Water: Healing and Discovering Ourselves</h2><p>Dear Reader, <br> <br> I am honored that you have picked up <i>The True Power of Water.</i> In a world of no mistakes, it is not by coincidence that you and I are embarking on this journey. The words and pictures you are about to see will open a new world of possibilities for you -- just as my research has done for me. <br> <br> In this book you will learn of the unique properties of water and its ability to improve your health and your life. You will see the effect each of us has on water -- not only the water we drink but also the water that makes up 70 percent of the human body and, most importantly, what happens to that water as we interact with each other. <br> <br> 2005 marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade of Water. It is our individual responsibility to learn all we can about water, the most precious resource on our planet, and to help shift the consciousness through our thoughts, through our words and prayers, and through our commitment to respect each other with love and gratitude. May our understanding of water help bring peace to all humankind. <br> <br> Masaru Emoto</p><p>This follow up to Dr. Emoto&#x2019;s international bestseller <i>The Hidden Messages in Water</i> is the result of his latest scientific research into the healing properties of water. Building upon his previous work, which proved that water and water molecules are affected by our thoughts, words, and emotions, in <i>The True Power of Water</i>, Dr. Emoto makes the case that water literally holds the key to good health and shows how we can interact with it with our thoughts, intentions, and prayer to reverse illness. <p> Accompanied by numerous compelling photographs showing that water crystals are transformed according to the positive and negative thoughts they are exposed to, this book provides practical steps that anyone can use to improve their own well-being by learning how to consciously interact with water, the primary component of our bodies. Also discussed is Dr. Emoto&#x2019;s research into the effects of prayer to purify rain water, helping to bring healing to the earth, as well as the mechanistic limitations of Western medicine and its understanding of both healing and disease. No one who reads Dr. Emoto&#x2019;s works will ever take water for granted again.</p><b>Masaru Emoto</b> is an internationally renowned Japanese researcher who has gained worldwide acclaim. Emoto is a graduate of the Yokohama Municipal University's department of humanities and sciences with a focus on International Relations, and he receive certification as a Doctor of Alternative Medicine from the Open International University.<br><br>Emoto's research has visually captured the structure of water at the moment of freezing, and through high-speed photography he has shown the direct consequences of destructive thoughts and the thoughts of love and appreciation of the formation of water crystals. The revelation that our thoughts can influence water has profound implications for our health and the well-being of the planet.<br><br>Masaru Emoto has written many books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>The Hidden Messages in Water,</i> and his books have been published in twenty-four languages.</p><h2>Barefoot Gen, Vol. 2: The Day After</h2><p>Barefoot Gen Volume Two &#x2015;"The Day After" &#x2015;tells the story of the day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, as seen through the eyes of seven-year-old Gen Nakaoka. Gen, his mother, and his newborn sister face the horrors of the day after the bomb.</p><p>Nakazawa was born in Hiroshima, and was six years old when the city was destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945. All of his family members who had not been evacuated died in the bombing, except for his mother, and an infant sister who died several weeks after the bombing. Compelled to tell his story in the memory of his family, Keiji Nakazawa is best known for his epic tragic history Barefoot Gen.A Note From the Author: <br><br> The atomic bomb exploded 600 meters above my hometown of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 a.m. I was a little over a kilometer away from the epicenter, standing at the back gate of Kanzaki Primary School, when I was hit by a terrible blast of wind and searing heat. I was six years old. I owe my life to the school's concrete wall. If I hadn't been standing in its shadow, I would have been burned to death instantly by the 5,000degree heat flash. Instead, I found myself in a living hell, the details of which remain etched in my brain as if it happened yesterday. <br> My mother, Kimiyo, was eight months pregnant. She was on the second floor balcony of our house, had just finished hanging up the wash to dry, and was turning to go back inside when the bomb exploded. The blast blew the entire balcony, with my mother on it, into the alley behind our house. Miraculously, my mother survived without a scratch. <br> The blast blew our house flat. The second floor collapsed onto the first, trapping my father, my sister Eiko, and my brother Susumu under it. My brother had been sitting in the front doorway, playing with a toy ship. His head was caught under the rafter over the doorway. He frantically kicked his legs and cried out for my mother. My father, trapped inside the house, begged my mother to do something. ...</p><h2>Radical Responsibility: How to Move Beyond Blame, Fearlessly Live Your Highest Purpose, and Become an Unstoppable Force for Good</h2><p><p><b>An Invitation to Discover Personal Freedom, Authentic Relationships, and Limitless Possibility </b></p><p> What is the greatest obstacle to your fulfillment, success, and happiness?

You said I killed you - haunt me, then&#39; Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange on the bleak Yorkshire moors, is forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord. There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before: of the intense passion between the foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and her betrayal of him.

Pieper provides a biography of Aquinas, an overview of the 13th century he lived in, and a wonderful synthesis of his vast writings. Pieper shows how Aquinas reconciled the pragmatic thought of Aristotle with the Church, proving that realistic knowledge need not preclude belief in the spiritual realities of religion. According to Pieper, the marriage of faith and reason proposed by Aquinas in his great synthesis of a theologically founded worldliness was not merely one solution among many, but the great principle expressing the essence of the Christian West. Pieper reveals his extraordinary command of original sources and excellent secondary materials as he illuminates the thought of the great intellectual Doctor of the Church.</p><p><b>Josef Pieper</b>, perhaps the most popular Thomist philosopher of the twentieth century, was schooled in the Greek classics and the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. He also studied philosophy, law, and sociology, and he was a professor at the University of Munster, West Germany. His numerous books have been widely praised by both the secular and religious press.<p></p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Opera 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving Opera</h2><p>Opera is the fastest growing of all the performing arts, attracting audiences of all ages who are enthralled by the gorgeous music, vivid drama, and magnificent production values.

It is an invitation to the reader to put aside their traditional understanding of the Gospel of John and to replace it with another one more faithful to the original text perspective. The Jesus that will emerge will provoke to rethink most of what you knew about this gospel. The book is a well-rounded verse-by-verse illustrated rethinking of the fourth gospel. Here is the catch: instead of reading it, as if it was written for 21 century Gentile Christians, the book interprets it as if it was written for the first-century peoples of ancient Israel. The book proves what Krister Stendahl stated long time ago: &#x201c;Our vision is often more abstracted by what we think we know than by our lack of knowledge.&#x201d; Other than challenging the long-held interpretations of well-known stories, the author with the skill of an experienced tour guide, takes us to a seat within those who most probably heard this gospel read in the late first century. Such exploration of variety of important contexts allows us to recover for our generation the true riches of this marvelous Judean gospel.&#x201c;A genuine apologetic is one that is true to the texts and the history, akin to the speeches of a defense attorney with integrity.

He put down the Wii controller. He was twelve under par with three holes left to play and thus very well on the way to qualifying for the Masters. He was playing Rick Fowler, as he was the only golfer in the Tiger Woods Masters who was cool and anywhere close to his own age, twenty-one. And they both liked Eminem and Rise Against and wearing orange. Of course Rick Fowler could afford his own flat whereas Stian still lived at home. But it was only temporary, until he got a scholarship to go to university in Alaska. All semi-decent downhill skiers went there if they got good results in the Nordic Junior Ski Championship and so on. Of course, no one became a better skier from going there, but so what? Women, wine and skis. What could be better. Perhaps the odd exam if there was time. The qualification could lead to an OK job. Money for his own flat. A life that was better than this, sleeping in the slightly too short bed under posters of Bode Miller and Aksel Lund Svindal, eating Mum&#x2019;s rissoles and obeying Dad&#x2019;s rules, training mouthy brats who according to their snow-blind parents had the talent to be a Kjetil Andr� Aamodt or a Lasse Kjus. Operating the ski lifts in Tryvannskleiva for a wage they wouldn&#x2019;t bloody dare give child workers in India. And that was how Stian knew it was the chairman of the Ski Club on the phone now. He was the only person Stian knew who avoided ringing people on their mobiles because it was a bit more expensive, and who preferred to force them to run downstairs in prehistoric houses that still had landlines.<br><br>Stian took the receiver his mother held out for him.<br><br>"Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Stian, Bakken here.&#x201d; Bakken meant slope, and it really was his name. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been told the Kleiva lift&#x2019;s running.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now?&#x201d; Stian said, looking at his watch. 11:15 at night. Closing time was at nine.<br><br>&#x201c;Could you nip up and see what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unless you&#x2019;re extremely busy, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Stian ignored the sarcasm in the chairman&#x2019;s intonation. He knew he&#x2019;d had two disappointing seasons and that the chairman didn&#x2019;t think it was down to lack of talent but to the large amounts of time Stian did his best to fill with general idleness.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got a car,&#x201d; Stian said.<br><br>&#x201c;You can use mine,&#x201d; his mother chipped in. She hadn&#x2019;t gone away;<br>she was standing next to him with her arms crossed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sorry, Stian, but I heard that,&#x201d; the chairman commented laconically. &#x201c;The Heming skateboarders must have broken in. I suppose they think it&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;<br>It took Stian ten minutes to drive the winding road up to Tryvann Tower. The TV mast was a 118-metre-long javelin drilled into the ground at the top of Oslo&#x2019;s north-western mountains.<br><br>He came to a halt in the snow-covered car park and noted that the only other vehicle there was a red Golf. He took his skis from the roof box, put them on and skated past the main building and up to where the main chairlift, Tryvann Ekspress, marked the top of the skiing facilities. From there he could see down to the lake and the smaller Kleiva lift with T-bars. Even though there was light from the moon it was too dark to check whether the bars were moving, but he could hear it. The hum of the machinery down below.<br><br>And as he set off, skiing in long, lazy curves, it struck him how strangely still it was up here at night. It was as if the first hour after they closed was still filled with the echoes of screams of pleasure, girls&#x2019; exaggerated whines of terror, boys&#x2019; testosterone-filled cries for attention, steel edges cutting into hard-packed snow and ice. Even when they switched off the floodlights the light seemed to hang in the air for a while. But then, gradually, it became quieter. And darker. And even quieter. Until the silence filled all the hollows in the terrain, and the darkness crept out from the forest. And it was as though Tryvann became a different place, a place which even for Stian, who knew it like the back of his hand, was so unfamiliar it might as well have been another planet. A cold, dark and uninhabited planet.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The lack of light meant he had to ski by feeling and try to predict how the snow and the ground would roll and pitch beneath the skis. But that was his special talent, which meant he always did best when there was bad visibility, heavy snow, mist, flat light: he could feel what he couldn&#x2019;t see, he had that kind of clairvoyance some skiers just have and others&#x2014;most of them&#x2014;don&#x2019;t. He caressed the snow, moving slowly to prolong the enjoyment. Then he was down and pulled up in front of the ski-lift hut.<br><br>The door had been smashed in.<br><br>There were splinters in the snow, and the door gaped wide open. It was only then that Stian realised he was alone. That it was the middle of the night, that at this moment he was in a deserted area where a crime had just been committed. Probably only a prank, but nevertheless. He could not be entirely sure. Sure it was only a prank. Sure he was on his own.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; Stian shouted above the hum of the engine and rattle of the T-bars coming and going on the buzzing wire above him. And regretted it at once. The echo returned from the mountainside with the sound of his own fear. He was afraid. Because the brain had not stopped churning at &#x201c;alone&#x201d; and &#x201c;crime,&#x201d; it had carried on. Back to the old story. It wasn&#x2019;t something he thought about during the day, but now and then when he was on the evening shift and there was hardly anyone on the slopes occasionally the story did creep out of the forest with the darkness. It had been late one night, a mild snowless December. The girl must have been drugged somewhere in the city centre and been driven up here. Handcuffs and hood. She had been transported from the car park to where the door had been smashed in and she was raped inside. Stian had heard that the fifteen-year-old girl was so small and slim that if she had been unconscious the rapist or rapists could easily have carried her from the car park. You could only hope she had been unconscious throughout. But Stian had also heard that the girl had been attached to the wall by two big nails, one under each collarbone, so that he or they could rape her standing up with minimal physical contact with the walls, floor or girl. That was why the police hadn&#x2019;t found any DNA, fingerprints or clothing fibres. But perhaps that wasn&#x2019;t true. What he knew was true was that they had found the girl in three places. At the bottom of Lake Tryvann they had found the torso and head. In the forest down from the Wyller slalom course half of her lower body. On the banks of Lake Aurtje<br>the other half. And it was because the two last parts were found so far apart and so far from where she had been raped that the police had speculated that there might have been two rapists. But that was all they had, speculation. The men&#x2014;if they were men; there was no sperm to prove it&#x2014;were never found. But the chairman and other jokers liked to tell younger club members doing their first evening shift that on still nights people said they had heard sounds from the hut. Screams. Nails being hammered into the wall.<br><br>Stian released his boots from the bindings and walked to the door. Bent his knees and tensed his calves, trying to ignore his racing pulse.<br><br>Jesus, what was he expecting to see? Blood and guts? Ghosts?<br><br>He reached inside the door, found the switch with his hand and twisted.<br><br>Stared into the lit room.<br><br>On the unpainted pine wall, hanging from a nail, was a girl. She was almost naked, only a yellow bikini covering the so-called strategic parts of her suntanned body. The month was December, and the calendar was last year&#x2019;s. One very quiet evening, a few weeks before, in fact, Stian had masturbated in front of that picture. She was sexy enough, but what had excited him most was the girls passing outside the window. Him sitting there, stiffy in hand, only a metre from them. Especially the girls who took the T-bar on their own, who with an experienced hand placed the erect pole between their thighs and squeezed them together. The T-bar lifting their buttocks. Their backs arched as the extended spring attached to the pole and the wire contracted and jerked them away from him, out of sight, along the aerial tramway.<br><br>Stian entered the cabin. There was no doubt someone had been there. The power control was broken. The plastic knob lay in two sections on the floor, leaving the metal spindle sticking up from the console. He held the cold spindle between thumb and forefinger and tried to turn it, but it just slipped between his fingers. He walked over to the little fuse cupboard in the corner. The metal door was locked, and the key that used to hang from the string on the adjacent wall was gone. Strange. He went back to the console. Tried to pull the plastic covers off the controls for the floodlights and the music so he could swap one over, but realised he would destroy them as well; they were either glued or moulded. He needed something he could tighten round the spindle, a monkey wrench or something similar. As Stian pulled out a drawer from the table in front of the window he had a premonition. The same one he had when he was skiing blind.<br>He could feel what he couldn&#x2019;t see. Someone was standing outside in the darkness watching him.<br><br>He looked up.<br><br>And into a face staring at him with large, wide-open eyes.<br><br>His own face, his own terrified eyes in the reflection in the windowpane, a double exposure.<br><br>Stian breathed out with relief. Shit, he was so easily frightened.<br><br>But then, as his heart began to beat again and he shifted his attention back to the drawer, it was as if his eye caught a movement outside, a face detaching itself from the reflection and vanishing to the right and out of sight. He looked up quickly again. There was still a reflection of himself. A double exposure as before. Or was it?<br><br>He&#x2019;d always had an overactive imagination. That was what Marius and Kjella had told him when he said thinking about the raped girl turned him on. Not her being raped and killed of course. Or rather, yes, the rape was . . . something he thought about, he had added. But mostly, that she was very nice, nice and pretty, kind of. And that she had been in the cabin, naked, with a dick in her slit, that . . . yes, that was a thought that could turn him on. Marius had said he was sick and Kjella, the bastard, had of course blabbed, and when Stian heard the story again Stian was supposed to have said he would have liked to have joined in the rape. That&#x2019;s pals for you, Stian thought, rummaging through the drawer. Lift passes, stamp, stamp pad, pens, tape, scissors, sheath knife, invoice pad, screws, nuts. Bloody hell! He went on to the next drawer. No wrench, no keys. And then he realised he could just look for the emergency stop pole they usually kept rammed in the snow outside the cabin so that anyone could stop the lift by hitting the red button on top of the pole if something happened. And something was always happening: children banging their heads on the T-bar and beginners falling off backwards as the lift jerked into action, hanging on and being dragged up onto the cable. Or idiots who wanted to show off and wrapped a knee round the bar while leaning over the side to piss into the edge of the forest as they went past.<br><br>He ransacked the cupboards. The pole should be easy enough to find, about a metre long, made of metal and shaped like a crowbar with a pointed end so that it could stick into packed snow and ice. Stian pushed aside forgotten mittens, hats and goggles. Next cupboard, firefighting equipment. A bucket and cloths. First-aid kit. A torch. But no pole.<br><br>Of course they might have forgotten it when they locked up for the night.<br>He grabbed the torch and went outside, did a circuit round the cabin.<br><br>No pole there, either. Christ, had they stolen it or what? And left the lift passes? Stian thought he heard something and turned to the forest. Shone the torch on the trees.<br><br>A bird? A squirrel? Elk did sometimes come down here, but they didn&#x2019;t make much of an effort to hide. If he could only switch off the bloody lift, he would be able to hear better.<br><br>Stian went back into the cabin and noticed that he felt more at ease inside. Picked up the two pieces of the plastic knob from the floor, tried placing them around the spindle and turning, but it was no use.<br><br>He looked at his watch. Soon be midnight. He wanted to finish the round of golf in Augusta before going to bed. Wondered whether to phone the chairman. All he had to do was give this spindle a half-turn!<br><br>His head shot up instinctively and his heart stopped beating.<br><br>It had happened so quickly he was unsure whether he had seen it or not. Whatever it was, it was not an elk. Stian keyed in the name of the chairman, but his fingers were trembling so much he made several mistakes before getting it right.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The emergency pole&#x2019;s gone. I can&#x2019;t turn the lift off.&#x201d; &#x201c;The fuse cupboard . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Locked and the key&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard the chairman cursing under his breath. Then a sigh of resignation. &#x201c;Stay there. I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bring a wrench or something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wrench or something,&#x201d; the chairman repeated, making no attempt to conceal his contempt.<br><br>Stian had long known the chairman&#x2019;s respect was measured in terms of your ranking in skiing championships. He put his mobile in his pocket. Stared out into the darkness. And it struck him that everyone could see him with the light on and he couldn&#x2019;t see anyone. He got up, closed what was left of the door and switched off the light. Waited. The empty T-bars coming down from the slopes above his head seemed to accelerate as they swung round the end of the lift before starting the ascent again.<br><br>Stian blinked.<br><br>Why hadn&#x2019;t he thought of that before?<br><br>He turned all the knobs on the console. And as the floodlights came on over the slope Jay-Z&#x2019;s &#x201c;Empire State of Mind&#x201d; rang out<br>from the loudspeakers and filled the valley. That&#x2019;s the way, now it was a bit more homely.<br><br>He drummed his fingers and looked at the spindle again. There was a hole at the top. He got up, grabbed the string from beside the fuse cupboard, doubled it and threaded it through the hole. Wrapped it round the spindle once and pulled carefully. This could actually work. He pulled a little harder. The string was holding. Even harder. The spindle moved. He yanked it.<br><br>The sound of the lift machinery died with a long-drawn-out groan culminating in a squeal.<br><br>&#x201c;Take that, you motherfucker!&#x201d; Stian shouted.<br><br>He leaned over the phone to ring the chairman and inform him the job was done. Remembered the chairman would hardly approve of rap being played at full blast over the speakers at night and switched it off.<br><br>Listened to the phone ringing. That was all he could hear now; suddenly it was ver y quiet. Come on, answer! A nd then there it was again. The feeling. The feeling that someone was there. Someone was watching him.<br>&lt;...</p><h2>First King of Shannara</h2><p>Horrified by the misuse of magic they had witnessed during the First War of the Races, the Druids at Paranor devoted themselves to the study of the old sciences, from the period before the collapse of civilization a thousand years before. Only the Bremen and a few trusted associates still studied the arcane arts. And for his persistence, Bremen found himself outcast, avoided by all but the few free-thinkers among the Druids.<br><br>But his removal from Paranor was not altogether a terrible thing, for Bremen learned that dark forces were on the move from the Northlands. That seemingly invincible armies of trolls were fast conquering all that lay to their south. That the scouts for the army--and its principal assassins--were Skull Bearers, disfigured and transformed Druids who had fallen prey to the seductions of the magic arts. And that at the heart of the evil tide was an archmage and former Druid named Brona!<br><br>Using the special skills he had acquired through his own study of Magic, Bremen was able to penetrate the huge camp of the Troll army and learn many of its secrets. And he immediately understood that if the peoples of the Four Lands were to escape eternal subjugation they would need to unite. But, even united, they would need a weapon, something so powerful that the evil magic of Brona, the Warlock Lord, would fail before its might...</p><p>Dark forces are on the move from the Northlands, and Bremen, an outcast Druid, learns of the huge Troll armies on the march and the Skull Bearers who act as their spies. To save the Druids, Bremen must convince the people of the Four Lands that their only hope lies in uniting -- and in using the magic they fear above all else.<b>Terry Brooks</b>&nbsp;has thrilled readers for decades with his powers of imagination and storytelling.

The book charts the progress of a relationship between a man and a woman, from their first kiss to the onset of anxiety and heartbreak.

For the Jubilee 2000, he chose Vietnamese Archbishop Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan. Testimony of Hope is the complete text of those Spiritual Exercises. In this moving work, Archbishop Van Thuan addresses our need for hope at the beginning of the twenty-first century. As a prisoner in various Communist prisons for thirteen years, nine of them in solitary confinement, Archbishop Van Thuan faced what he describes as the agonizing pain of isolation and abandonment. Recounting the details of those long years, he reveals the secret that allowed him to cling to hope in the midst of despair. Archbishop Van Thuan&#39;s message to John Paul 11 is also for us: the hope he discovered in imprisonment is also our hope for the Church and the world at this momentous point in history. Faced with any darkness, we have a reason for confidence: Christ, Hope of the World. Francis Xavier Nguyen Van 7huan was made the bishop of Nha Trang in 1967, and in 1975, coadjutor bishop of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City). Arrested only a few months after his appointment, Archbishop Van 7huan was imprisoned by the Vietnamese government for thirteen years and then released to house arrest. In 1991, Van Thuan was expelled from Vietnam. He went to Rome and began his work in the Roman Curia as Vice President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. Since 1998, Archbishop Van 7huan has served as the Council&#39;s President. In 2001, Van 7huan was named a Cardinal.

Twenty years ago, doctors and researchers didn&#x2019;t think so. Back then, most experts believed that differences in how girls and boys behave are mainly due to differences in how they were treated by their parents, teachers, and friends.<br> <br>It's hard to cling to that belief today. An avalanche of research over the past twenty years has shown that sex differences are more significant and profound than anybody guessed. Sex differences are real, biologically programmed, and important to how children are raised, disciplined, and educated. <br><br>In <i>Why Gender Matters</i>, psychologist and family physician Dr. Leonard Sax leads parents through the mystifying world of gender differences by explaining the biologically different ways in which children think, feel, and act. He addresses a host of issues, including discipline, learning, risk taking, aggression, sex, and drugs, and shows how boys and girls react in predictable ways to different situations. <br><br>For example, girls are born with more sensitive hearing than boys, and those differences increase as kids grow up. So when a grown man speaks to a girl in what he thinks is a normal voice, she may hear it as yelling. Conversely, boys who appear to be inattentive in class may just be sitting too far away to hear the teacher&#x2014;especially if the teacher is female. <br><br>Likewise, negative emotions are seated in an ancient structure of the brain called the amygdala. Girls develop an early connection between this area and the cerebral cortex, enabling them to talk about their feelings. In boys these links develop later. So if you ask a troubled adolescent boy to tell you what his feelings are, he often literally cannot say.<br><br>Dr. Sax offers fresh approaches to disciplining children, as well as gender-specific ways to help girls and boys avoid drugs and early sexual activity. He wants parents to understand and work with hardwired differences in children, but he also encourages them to push beyond gender-based stereotypes. <br><br>A leading proponent of single-sex education, Dr. Sax points out specific instances where keeping boys and girls separate in the classroom has yielded striking educational, social, and interpersonal benefits. Despite the view of many educators and experts on child-rearing that sex differences should be ignored or overcome, parents and teachers would do better to recognize, understand, and make use of the biological differences that make a girl a girl, and a boy a boy.</p><p><b>LEONARD SAX, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, is a practicing physician, a Ph.D.&nbsp;psychologist, and a speaker for community groups, schools, and professional organizations.

Social and biological insights are leaping together, part of a large and complex jigsaw puzzle to which the contributions of many sciences are essential.</i><br><br>--Shelley Taylor, professor of psychology, UCLA, 20021<br><br>Matthew turned five years old the summer before kindergarten started. He was looking forward to it. From what he had heard, kindergarten sounded like just one long play date with friends. He could hardly wait. So his mother, Cindy, was surprised when, in October, Matthew started refusing to go to school, refusing even to get dressed in the morning. More than once, Cindy had to dress him, carry him writhing and thrashing into the car, and then drag him from the car into the school. She decided to investigate. She sat in on his kindergarten class. She spoke with the teacher. Everything seemed fine. The teacher&#x2014;gentle, soft-spoken, and well-educated&#x2014;reassured Mom that there was no cause for alarm. But Cindy remained concerned, and rightly so, because major problems were just around the corner.<br>Caitlyn was a shy child and just the slightest bit overweight all through elementary school. In middle school, she underwent a metamorphosis from chubby wallflower to outgoing socialite. She lost weight so quickly that her mother, Jill, worried she might be anorexic. For the next four years, though, everything seemed great&#x2014;in a frantic and crazy sort of way. Caitlyn was juggling a heavy academic load, had lots of friends, and maintained a full schedule of after-school activities, staying up until midnight or later doing homework. But she seemed happy enough: often frenzied and frazzled, sure, but still happy. Or at least that's what everybody thought until the phone rang at 3 a.m. that awful, unforgettable November night. A nurse told Jill that Caitlyn was in the emergency room, unconscious, having tried to commit suicide with an overdose of Vicodin and Xanax.<br>These true stories(2) share a grim common element: each kid started out okay, then took a turn in the wrong direction. There is another element in common as well. In both cases the problem arose because the parents did not understand some basic differences between girls and boys. In each case, trouble might have been averted if the parents had known enough about gender differences to recognize what was really happening in their child's life. In each case, the parents could have taken specific action that might have prevented or solved the problem.<br><br>We will come back to both of these kids later in this book. Right now it may not be obvious to you how each of these stories illustrates a failure to understand sex differences in child development. That's okay. Later on, we'll hear more about Matthew and Caitlyn. Armed with some basic knowledge about hardwired gender differences, you'll be able to recognize where the parents made the wrong decision or failed to act, and you'll see how the story might have ended differently.<br><br><b>The Dubious Virtue of Gender-Neutral Child-Rearing</b><br><br>I enrolled in the Ph.D. program in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in September 1980. Governor Ronald Reagan was challenging President Jimmy Carter for the Presidency. The original Apple computer had recently come on the market. "My typewriter is working fine," was the answer the department secretary gave me when I asked her whether she would be getting a word processor anytime soon. Nobody I knew had ever heard of Bill Gates, e-mail, or the Internet. The invention of the World Wide Web still lay ten years in the future.<br><br>Among the courses I took that fall was a graduate seminar in developmental psychology. "Why do girls and boys behave differently?" my professor, Justin Aronfreed, asked rhetorically. "Because we <i>expect</i> them to. Imagine a world in which we raised girls to play with tanks and trucks, in which we encouraged boys to play with dolls. Imagine a world in which we played rough-and-tumble games with girls while we cuddled and hugged the boys. In such a world, many of the differences we see in how girls and boys behave&#x2014;maybe even all the differences&#x2014;would vanish."<br><br>In another seminar my fellow graduate students and I learned about the extraordinary work of Professor John Money at Johns Hopkins. Professor Money had been consulted by the parents of an unfortunate little boy whose penis had literally been sizzled off during a botched circumcision. At Dr. Money's recommendation, the boy had been raised as a girl, with excellent results (according to Dr. Money). The child loved to play dress-up, enjoyed helping Mom in the kitchen, and disdained "boy toys" such as guns or trucks. "Dr. Money's work provides further evidence that most of the differences we observe between girls and boys are socially constructed," professor Henry Gleitman told us. "We reward children who follow the sex roles we create for them while we penalize or at least fail to reward children who don't conform. Parents create and reinforce the differences we observe between girls and boys."<br><br>We nodded sagely. In clinical rotations we often encountered parents who still clung to the quaint notion that girls and boys were different from birth. But we knew better.<br><br>Or so we thought.<br><br>When I left Philadelphia to begin my residency in family practice, I threw out most of the papers I had accumulated during my six years at the University of Pennsylvania. Stacks of photocopied scientific papers had to go out in the trash. But there was one manila folder I didn't throw out, a folder containing a series of studies done by Professor John Corso at Penn State during the 1950s and 1960s, demonstrating that females hear better than males.(3)<br><br>Four years later, after I finished my residency, my wife and I established a family practice in Montgomery County, Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C. Years passed. I wasn't thinking much about gender differences. Then in the mid-1990s, I began to notice a parade of second- and third-grade boys marching into my office, their parents clutching a note from the school. The notes read: "We're concerned that Justin [or Juan or Michael or Tyrone] may have attention deficit disorder. Please evaluate."<br><br>In some of these cases I found that what these boys needed wasn't drugs for ADD, but rather a teacher who understood the hardwired differences in how girls and boys learn. Upon further inquiry, I found that nobody at the school was aware of gender differences in the ability to hear. I reread Professor Corso's papers, which documented that boys don't hear as well as girls. In the next chapter we'll look more closely at evidence for gender differences in hearing.<br><br>Think about the typical second-grade classroom. Imagine Justin, six years old, sitting at the back of the class. The teacher, a woman, is speaking in a tone of voice that seems about right to her. Justin barely hears her. Instead, he's staring out the window, or watching a fly crawl across the ceiling. The teacher notices that Justin isn't paying attention. Justin is demonstrating a deficit of attention. The teacher may reasonably wonder whether Justin perhaps has attention deficit disorder.<br><br>The teacher is absolutely right about Justin showing a deficit of attention. But his attention deficit isn't due to "attention deficit disorder," it's due to the fact that Justin can barely hear the soft-spoken teacher. The teacher is talking in a tone of voice that is comfortable to her and to the girls in the class, but some of the boys are practically falling asleep. In some cases we might be able to fix the problem simply by putting the boy in the front row.<br><br>Once, after I had done such an evaluation and made my recommendations, the parents told me that the school had advised them to seek a second opinion. "It's not that we don't trust you, Dr. Sax," Mom said. "It's just that the school really thinks we should get an opinion from an expert."<br><br>I soon learned that the only doctors that this particular school considered to be "experts" were doctors who always prescribed medication. Curious to know whether my experience was unique, I obtained funding from the American Academy of Family Physicians to survey all the doctors in the Washington area. Our survey basically asked one simple question: Who first suggests the diagnosis of ADD? The results: in the majority of cases the diagnosis of ADD is made by the teacher. Not by the parents, nor the neighbors, nor the doctor.(4)<br><br>There would be nothing wrong with teachers diagnosing their students as long as they had the training&#x2014;and the resources, and adequate <i>time</i>&#x2014;to distinguish the boy with ADD from the boy who just doesn't hear as well as most girls do. But after talking to dozens of teachers in our county, I didn't find one who was aware of the studies showing that girls hear better than boys.<br><br>"You should write a book, Dr. Sax," one of these parents told me. "Write a book so that teachers know about the differences in how girls and boys hear."<br><br>I allowed myself a patronizing smile. "I'm sure that there must already be dozens of such books for teachers, and for parents," I said.<br><br>"There aren't," she said.<br><br>"I'll find some for you," I said.<br><br>That conversation took place about seven years ago. Since then I've read lots of popular books about differences between girls and boys. And guess what. That mom was right.<br><br>Not only do most of the books currently in print about girls and boys fail to state the basic facts about innate differences between the sexes, many of them promote a bizarre form of political correctness, suggesting that it is somehow chauvinistic even to hint that any innate differences exist between female and male. A tenured professor at Brown University recently published a book in which she claims that the division of the human race into two sexes, female and male, is an artificial invention of our culture. "Nature really offers us more than two sexes," she claims, adding, "Our current notions of masculinity and femininity are cultural conceits." The decision to "label" a child as a girl or a boy is "a <i>social</i> decision," according to this expert. We should not label any child as being <i>either</i> a girl <i>or</i> a boy, this professor proclaimed. "There is no either/or. Rather, there are shades of difference."(5) This book received courteous mention in the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i>. America's most prestigious medical journal, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, praised the author for her "careful and insightful" approach to gender.(6)<br><br>I soon assembled a small library of best-selling books that counsel parents that the best child-rearing is gender-neutral child-rearing. These books tell parents that true virtue is to be found in training your child to play with toys traditionally associated with the opposite sex. You should buy dolls for your son, to teach him how to nurture.(7) You should buy an Erector set for your daughter. The underlying assumptions&#x2014;that giving dolls to boys will cause boys to become more nurturing, or that giving girls Erector sets will improve girls' spatial relations skills&#x2014;are never questioned. In fact, no scientific evidence exists to support the claim that gender-neutral child-rearing has any measurable benefit, regardless of which parameter you measure.(8)<br><br>On the same bookshelf you can find books that do affirm the existence of innate differences in how girls and boys learn. But what books! Books with titles like <i>The Wonder of Boys</i> and <i>Girls Will Be Girls</i> promote antiquated and inaccurate gender stereotypes. "Girls are more emotional than boys." "Boys have a brain-based advantage when it comes to learning math." As we'll see, those familiar notions turn out to be false.<br><br>On one hand, you have books claiming that there are no innate differences between girls and boys, and that anybody who thinks otherwise is a reactionary stuck in the 1950s. On the other, you have books affirming innate differences between girls and boys&#x2014;but these authors interpret these differences in a manner which reinforces gender stereotypes.<br>These books have only one thing in common. They are based less on fact, and more on their authors' personal beliefs or political agenda&#x2014;either to deny innate sex differences, or to use sex differences in child development as a justification for maintaining traditional sex roles.<br><br>After waiting a few years for somebody else to write a book about girls and boys based on actual scientific research, I finally decided to write one myself. But I made myself a promise. Every time I make any statement about how girls and boys are different, I will also state the evidence on which my statement is based. Every statement I make about sex differences will be supported by good science published in peer-reviewed journals.<br><br>There is more at stake here than the old question of nature versus nurture. The failure to recognize and respect sex differences in child development has done substantial harm over the past thirty years&#x2014;such will be my claim throughout this book. Children today face challenges that are substantially different from those you faced as a child or teenager, fifteen or twenty or thirty or forty years ago. Look at the statistics on drugs and alcohol, for starters. Teenage girls today are four times more likely to drink than their mothers were. They're <i>fifteen</i> times more likely to use drugs than their mothers were.(9) Traditionally, alcohol abuse has been more of a problem for teenage boys than for teenage girls. Not anymore. In a report published in 2004, the National Research Council reported that young teenage girls are now <i>more</i> likely than boys to be drinking alcohol regularly&#x2014;not because boys are drinking less, but because girls are drinking more.(10)<br><br>If girls have closed the gender gap with regard to alcohol abuse, boys are still more likely to be getting into trouble with drugs. According to FBI statistics, the number of boys under eighteen arrested for drug abuse offenses has increased by more than 50 percent in the past ten years; boys under eighteen are still five times more likely to be arrested for drug abuse violations than are girls under eighteen.(11) In chapter 7, I'll explore how the cultural and professional neglect of sex differences has compounded the drug problem.<br><br>But school, not drugs, is the "new" problem for boys. While today's girl is more likely to have problems with drugs and alcohol than her mother was, today's boy is much more likely to be struggling in school than his father was. Boys today are increasingly alienated from school. Recent investigations have shown a dramatic drop over the past twenty years in boys' academic performance in American schools.(12) According to the United States Department of Education, the average eleventh-grade American boy now writes at the same level as the average eighth-grade girl.(13) Similar gender gaps have been documented in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.(14) And the percentage of boys going on to college, and graduating from college, is falling. The U.S. Department of Education now projects that in the year 2011, there will be 140 women graduating from college for every 100 men&#x2014;very nearly a 60/40 female-to-male ratio.(15)<br><br>The future may already have arrived. Several major U.S. colleges and universities, such as New York University and the University of North Carolina, already report that their student body is more than 60 percent female.(16) I'm all in favor of women's colleges, but you have to ask ...</p><h2>The Giggly Guide to Grammar Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>THIS IS THE TEACHER EDITION WITH A CD PACKED WITH POSTERS, QUIZZES AND POWERPOINTS TO HELP TEACH LESSONS IN THIS BOOK. <br><br>It's Shel Silverstein meets Strunk and White and the results are both hilarious and instructive.

He saw the rise of Athens to greatness under the inspired leadership of Pericles. In 430, the second year of the Peloponnesian War, he caught and survived the horrible plague which he described so graphically. Later, as general in 423 he failed to save Amphipolis from the enemy and was disgraced. He tells about this, not in volumes of self-justification, but in one sentence of his history of the war&#x2015;that it befell him to be an exile for twenty years. He then lived probably on his property in Thrace, but was able to observe both sides in certain campaigns of the war, and returned to Athens after her defeat in 404. He had been composing his famous history, with its hopes and horrors, triumphs and disasters, in full detail from first-hand knowledge of his own and others.</p><p>The war was really three conflicts with one uncertain peace after the first; and Thucydides had not unified them into one account when death came sometime before 396. His history of the first conflict, 431&#x2013;421, was nearly complete; Thucydides was still at work on this when the war spread to Sicily and into a conflict (415&#x2013;413) likewise complete in his awful and brilliant record, though not fitted into the whole. His story of the final conflict of 413&#x2013;404 breaks off (in the middle of a sentence) when dealing with the year 411. So his work was left unfinished and as a whole unrevised. Yet in brilliance of description and depth of insight this history has no superior.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Thucydides is in four volumes.</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Learn the offensive strategies that require you to maintain the initiative and negotiate from a position of strength, or the defensive strategies designed to help you respond to dangerous situations and avoid unwinnable wars. The great warriors of battlefields and drawing rooms alike demonstrate prudence, agility, balance, and calm, and a keen understanding that the rational, resourceful, and intuitive always defeat the panicked, the uncreative, and the stupid. An indispensable book, <i>The 33 Strategies of War</i> provides all the psychological ammunition you need to overcome patterns of failure and forever gain the upper hand.</p><p><b>Robert Greene</b> has a degree in classical studies and is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>The 48 Laws of Power, The 33 Strategies of War</i>, <i>The Art of Seduction</i>, and <i>Mastery</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.<br><br><b>Joost Elffers</b> is the packaging genius behind Viking Studio's Secret Language series, <i>Play with Your Food</i>, and <i>How Are You Peeling?</i>. He lives in New York City.The classical scholar and author says that war occurs in five contexts--when we execute it individually, with an army of some kind, from an offensive position, from a defensive position, and through unconventional, or dirty, means. The suggestions and ideas behind this lesson are thoroughly illustrated with concise historical vignettes. Deftly balancing theory and practice, the author asks listeners to examine their options for handling conflict, understand the meaning of their past experiences, and commit themselves fully to a mature and appropriate response to conflict. He has an impressive understanding of the psychological and organizational challenges in warfare. Don Leslie gives a softly intimate reading that sounds aptly erudite but not overly intense. Pacing himself steadily, he organizes the thick sentences and dense ideas with finesse.

The Kitchen God's Wife</p><h2>The End of Eternity</h2><p>Andrew Harlan, one of the operatives who help control human history, breaks the rules to help Noys Lambent, the woman he loves, escape a reality change</p><p>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was born in Russia and taken to America in 1923, becoming an American citizen in 1928. He took a degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1939, and took his MA in 1941 and his PhD in 1948, after spending the war years in the Naval Air Experimental Station. He joined the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949, becoming associate professor of biochemistry. He is best known for the Robot and Foundation sequences.<p>1. TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>The Justin Wilson Cook Book</h2><p><p>This unique collection of Cajun recipes (and humor) will surely set your imagination on the right track, "I garontee." Recipes for everything from the perfect roux to Eggplant Appetizer a la Justin are included.</p></p><p><p>Perhaps no public figure in recent times was better known or better loved as an ambassador of Cajun culture than Justin Wilson. It was his work as a safety engineer that started him on the road to becoming one of the world's greatest Cajun storytellers. Wilson often told the story of how he got his start this way:</p><p>"Way back when I first started as a safety engineer, I took myself pretty seriously. And I found I was putting my audiences to sleep. So, having lived all my life among the Cajuns of Louisiana, and having a good memory for the patois and the type of humor Cajuns go for, I started interspersing my safety talks with Cajun humor. And what do you know? My audiences stayed awake."</p><p>Actually, they did a lot more than stay awake. They chuckled, they laughed, they roared-and they also learned their safety lessons. </p><p>Wilson leaves a legacy of having brought Cajun food to the world outside of southeast Louisiana. His cookbooks are unique, entertaining, and authentic. Original Cajun recipes include Red Bean Soup, French Fried Shrimp, Okra Gumbo, Venison Roast, and Dirty Rice. The meals prepared from this book are sure to go down in gustatory memory as the most exciting and interesting ever eaten! </p><p>Justin Wilson, always dapper in suspenders and a bow tie, was the author of several books. He starred in three acclaimed cooking series that aired on more than 300 PBS stations nationwide. The Cajun comedian produced 27 comedy albums that charmed audiences and, at one point, even outsold Elvis Presley. Wilson passed away on September 6, 2001, but his spirit lives on through the recipes he shared and the programs he made during his lifetime, which continue to air on PBS affiliates.</p></p><h2>My Father, the Pornographer: A Memoir</h2><p><b><i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i> BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR</b><br> <br>&#x201c;Chris Offutt owns one of the finest, surest prose styles around, ready and able to convey the hardest truth without flinching. Now Offutt enters the darkest and most mysterious of places&#x2014;the cave of a monstrous enigma named Andrew J. Offutt&#x2014;armed with nothing but his own restless curiosity. Spoiler alert: He makes it out alive, walking into the daylight to bring us a deeper, funnier, more tender and more heartbroken truth&#x2014;and his masterpiece.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Chabon<br><br>When Andrew Offutt died, his son, Chris, inherited a desk, a rifle, and eighteen hundred pounds of pornographic fiction. Andrew had been considered the &#x201c;king of twentieth-century smut,&#x201d; with a writing career that began as a strategy to pay for his son&#x2019;s orthodontic needs and soon took on a life of its own, peaking during the 1970s when the commercial popularity of the erotic novel reached its height.<br> <br> With his dutiful wife serving as typist, Andrew wrote from their home in the Kentucky hills, locked away in an office no one dared intrude upon. In this fashion he wrote more than four hundred novels, including pirate porn, ghost porn, zombie porn, and secret agent porn. The more he wrote, the more intense his ambition became and the more difficult it was for his children to be part of his world.<br> <br> Over the long summer of 2013, Chris returned to his hometown to help his widowed mother move out of his childhood home. As he began to examine his father&#x2019;s manuscripts and memorabilia, journals, and letters, he realized he finally had an opportunity to gain insight into the difficult, mercurial, sometimes cruel man he&#x2019;d loved and feared in equal measure. Only in his father&#x2019;s absence could he truly make sense of the man and his legacy.<br> <br> In<i> My Father, the Pornographer</i>, Offutt takes us on the journey with him, reading his father&#x2019;s prodigious literary output as both a critic and as a son seeking answers. This is a book about the life of a working writer who supports his family solely by the output of his typewriter; it&#x2019;s about the awful psychic burdens one generation unthinkingly passes along to the next; and it&#x2019;s about growing up in the Appalachian hills with a pack of fearless boys riding bicycles through the woods, happy and free.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2016:</strong> There&#x2019;s something wildly readable about <em>My Father, the Pornographer</em>. Chris Offutt grew up in rural Kentucky in the 1970s with three siblings, his mother, and his father. The father, Andrew Offutt, was a domestic despot who ruled the house by fear and edict&#x2014;when he wasn&#x2019;t intimidating his family, he spent most of his time writing science fiction and fantasy novels, as well as lots of pornography, which at the time was a reasonable way for a writer to make ends meet. The jumping off point of the book, and the catalyst for many of the younger Offutt&#x2019;s memories, takes place upon Andrew Offutt&#x2019;s death, when Chris begins to catalog his father&#x2019;s life&#x2019;s work. &#x201c;My father was a brilliant man, a true iconoclast, fiercely self-reliant, a dark genius, cruel, selfish, and eternally optimistic,&#x201d; Chris Offutt writes. We see the father through Chris&#x2019; eyes, and we see Chris and the rest of the family through his father&#x2019;s eyes. This is a fascinating memoir: honest, dark, amusing, and overlaid with a son&#x2019;s deep, if strained, love for his father. <em>-- Chris Schluep</em>Chris Offutt is an award-winning author and screenwriter.

The time is 1917. In Washington, President Wilson is about to lead the United States into the Great War. In California, a new industry is born that will transform America: moving pictures. Here is history as only Gore Vidal can re-create it: brimming with intrigue and scandal, peopled by the greats of the silver screen and American politics, from Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the author's own grandfather, the blind Senator Gore. With <b>Hollywood</b>, Vidal once again proves himself a superb storyteller and a perceptive chronicler of human nature's endless deceptions.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Who could possibly resist a novel that begins as William Randolph Hearst falls on his behind? The fifth novel in Gore Vidal's <i>Narratives of Empire</i> sequence (sixth, however, in order of publication) begins on the eve of American involvement in the First World War and ends shortly after the mysterious death of Warren G. Harding and ascension of the taciturn Calvin Coolidge to the presidency. Balanced against Gore's descriptions of all these political machinations is the story of newspaper publisher Caroline Sanford's foray into film acting, which places her in proximity to the scandals involving Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle and William Desmond Taylor. The cast of characters includes a young Franklin Delano Roosevelt--and his mistress, Lucy Mercer--and Vidal's maternal grandfather, Senator T.P. Gore. As always, the proceedings are enlivened by Vidal's caustic wit. <i>--Ron Hogan</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicked and provocative. . . .

Along with some 120,000 other persons of Japanese ancestry--77,000 of whom were U.S. citizens--she and her family were uprooted from their home and imprisoned in a camp. In this book, first published in 1952, she provides a unique personal account of these experiences.<p>"Monica Sone's account of life in the relocation camps is both fair and unsparing. It is also deeply touching, and occasionally hilarious." <i>--New York Herald Tribune</i></p><p>"The deepest impression that this unaffected, honest little story made on me was of smiling courage." <i>--San Francisco Chronicle</i></p></p><p>Monica Sone spent her childhood in pre-World War II Seattle, in a part Japanese, part American world. Dinner might be steak and pumpkin pie or pickled daikon, rice, and soy sauce; there was American public school during the day and the strict formality of Japanese school in the late afternoons. "I found myself switching my personality back and forth daily like a chameleon. At Bailey Gatzert School I was a jumping, screaming, roustabout Yankee, but at the stroke of three...I suddenly became a modest, faltering, earnest little Japanese girl with a small timid voice." Her memories of growing up are vivid and full of marvelous stories, showing the confusion, frustration, and enrichment of living within two cultures. These elements come together when Japan bombs Pearl Harbor and Monica and her family are sent to an internment camp in Topaz, Idaho. <b>Nisei Daughter</b> describes the loss of property and the personal insults, the barbed wire and armed guards, the dust storms, horrible food, unfinished barracks, and barren land - and the efforts of the Japanese-Americans to maintain their ethics, family life, and belief in the United States. Monica Sone is furious at the blatant disregard of her civil rights, and yet ironically, it is during her time in the camps and afterwards in the Midwest that she finally brings together the various aspects of her heritage. Straightforward, searching, often funny, this is a highly readable account of one woman's experience living in many worlds. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Your Eternal Reward: Triumph and Tears at the Judgment Seat of Christ</h2><p>Face to Face with ChristNo hiding. No opportunity to put a better spin on what you did. No attorney to represent you. The look in His eyes says it all.Like it or not, standing before Christ is precisely where you and I shall some day be, 'for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ' (2 Corinthians 5:10). And while we will not lose our entrance to heaven if we are believers, what we do in our earthly life will determine our standing in the eternal kingdom. There are eternal consequences to what we do. Jesus will not wink at our disobedience. He does not play favorites. We will be rewarded according to our faithfulness. There is no exception, no special deferment. When God calls our name we will be there. We cannot hide, for God will find us; we cannot scheme to make ourselves look good, for God shall see us. We cannot excuse ourselves, for God knows us. In Your Eternal Reward, pastor Erwin Lutzer teaches readers not only the effects of the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Great White Throne, but shares what Jesus will be looking for and how we can use the resources of this life to store up treasures in heaven. This life is training for the next. We are to be learning the rules of the kingdom and running the race to win the prize Christ has promised to His faithful servants. When He calls your name, will you hear Him say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant'?<br></p><p><b><i></i></b> <p><b><i></i>When we reflect on how we lived for Christ, we might weep on the other side of the celestial gates.</b></p> <p>To their own detriment, many Christians have emptied the judgment seat of Christ of its meaning, living like they will never meet His knowing gaze. For this they may have tears in heaven.</p> <p>In this provocative book, Dr. Erwin Lutzer argues that remorse in heaven awaits those who don't live fully for God on earth. Exploring the often-overlooked Scriptures about reward and judgment for Christians, Dr. Lutzer answers questions like:</p> <ul> <li>How will believers be judged?</li> <li>Do rewards for faithfulness vary?</li> <li>If heaven is perfect, why do rewards even matter?</li> </ul> <p>His answers are immensely practical. <i>Your Eternal Reward </i>will prompt you to live more faithfully, whether in your conduct, your speech, or even your use of money, that you might enjoy heaven all the more.</p> <p>What is sown on earth is reaped in heaven, and Dr. Lutzer will have you taking this truth seriously.</p><b>DR.

He has also been awarded the Douglas Southall Freeman Award for history. His books have been selected for Book-of-the-Month clubs, the History Book Club, and the Military History Book ClubThe most distinctive features of this coffee-table "Museum in a Book" are the lavish illustrations and accouterments. Color paintings depict tableaux from watershed moments in the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and the author attaches many removable facsimile reproductions of original documents associated with it. Copied on faux tattered parchment, these include journal entries and letters by Lewis and Clark, an encryption scheme devised by Jefferson, inventories and payrolls, hand-drawn maps, sketches of wildlife and a drawing of an Indian head-flattening device. These intriguing items are accompanied by a slender, boosterish narrative. Historian Gragg, author of Confederate Goliath: The Battle for Fort Fisher, salutes the leadership skills of Lewis and Clark, extols the scenery, nods respectfully to the Indian cultures along the way, plays up the contributions of Sacagawea and generally applauds the "epic journey" that "forged a nation" and "altered the course of history." But the Expedition was a long, arduous slog: one member died of a ruptured appendix; there was a fight with a small party of Indians, resulting in two Indian casualties, and some run-ins with grizzlies unhappy about being shot at; and Lewis was shot in the leg by a companion who mistook him for an elk. Gragg's treatment falls short of a nation-building adventure saga, but the interesting documentary "artifacts" lend a period authenticity that may captivate history buffs-especially younger ones. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Edelweiss: A Memoir of Combat and Conscience by a Soldier of the Waffen-SS</h2><p>Originally written while the author was a prisoner of the US Army in 1945&#x2013;46, <i>Black Edelweiss</i> is a boon to serious historians and WWII buffs alike. In a day in which most memoirs are written at half a century&#x2019;s distance, the former will be gratified by the author&#x2019;s precise recall facilitated by the chronologically short-range (a matter of one to seven years) at which the events were captured in writing. Both will appreciate and enjoy the abundantly detailed, exceptionally accurate combat episodes. <p>Even more than the strictly military narrative, however, the author has crafted a searingly candid view into his own mind and soul. As such, <i>Black Edelweiss</i> is much more than a "ripping yarn" or a low-level military history. <i>Black Edelweiss</i> joins not only the growing body of German military memoirs, but the more select, more narrowly-focused group of personal memoirs by other <i>Waffen-SS</i> enlisted men. Beyond the microcosmic view of combat these books relate&#x2014;to the extent that they are honest and candid&#x2014;such books are important for what they can reveal about their authors&#x2019; motivations and reflections on those impulses and their consequences. To date, these works differ significantly. </p><p>As it joins the ranks of the books in this genre, <i>Black Edelweiss</i> makes a unique and very important contribution. It is a true, personal account of the author&#x2019;s war years, first at school and then with the <i>Waffen-SS,</i> which he joined early in 1943 at the age of seventeen. For a year and a half, the author fought as a machine gunner in SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 11 "Reinhard Heydrich," mainly in the arctic and sub-arctic reaches of Soviet Karelia and Finland, and later at the Western frontier of the Third Reich. The characters in the story are real, and the conversations and actions are recounted to the best of his ability from the short distance at which he wrote the manuscript in 1945&#x2013;46. </p><p>Apart from the piercing insights into the question of why the German soldier fought as he did, what makes this book truly unique is the author&#x2019;s anguished, yet resolute examination of the dialectic between the honorable and valorous comportment of his comrades and the fundamentally reprehensible conduct of about 35,000 men behind the front lines who nevertheless wore the same uniform. </p><p>During his captivity, the author was assigned for a time as a clerk to a US Army Judge Advocate General&#x2019;s Corps officer, and in the performance of his administrative duties, the author had access to the mounting reams of documentation of the Holocaust. His growing recognition of the involvement of <i>Waffen-SS</i> personnel in the monstrous crimes of that process caused him to dig deeply into his soul, to examine his most intimate and private motivations and thoughts, and to reevaluate the most basic assumptions of his life to that point. The author captured this process and the result in the notes which became this book. </p><p>Honestly, forthrightly, and courageously told, <i>Black Edelweiss</i> is a precious gift to historians and other students of World War II. It not only provides a glimpse into the attributes that made the German armed forces a formidable and tenacious foe, but squarely confronts the most painful issue facing German World War II veterans in general, and <i>Waffen-SS</i> veterans in particular. </p><p>Supported by 22 photos, 8 maps, and notes.</p></p><p>The author is a loyal member of his division&#x2019;s veterans&#x2019; group, and his <i>bona fides</i> are impeccable. Before The Aberjona Press published this book, to the extent possible, his accounts of action, especially against the US Army, were vetted against primary sources in the National Archives, by examination of unit histories, and by interviews with American veterans who fought against the author&#x2019;s unit. Extensive research has been carried out by LTC Hugh Foster, US Army (Ret.) with hundreds of American survivors of the author&#x2019;s regiment&#x2019;s savage battle against them at Reipertswiller, Alsace, in January 1945. The author&#x2019;s recollections are completely supported by the available evidence. He has produced that rarest of memoirs, one that is untainted by gross hindsight or recast to fit later interpretations."A fascinating and unique contribution to our knowledge of the Waffen-SS...[and] the German armed forces...Highly recommended." -- <i>The Journal of Military History, July 2003</i><br><br>"A strong description of a young man's burning idealism to serve his country and how this idealism is later shattered." -- <i>Swedish State Institute for Living History, August 2005</i><br><br>"Highly recommended...complements <i>Into the Mountains Dark</i> and <i>The Good Soldier</i>." -- <i>Armchair General Magazine, September 2005</i><br><br>"Highly valuable because of its grass-roots perspective of the war and the Third Reich." -- <i><i>Svenska Dagbladet</i> (&#x201c;Swedish Daily Newspaper&#x201d;), 2 June 2004</i><br><br>"[This book possesses] an authenticity lacking in works written&#x2014;and also adjusted&#x2014;long after the war." -- <i><i>Gefle Dagblad</i> ("Gefle [Sweden] Daily Newspaper"), 21 June 2004</i></p><h2>Miss Spider&#39;s Tea Party: The Counting Book</h2><p>A sturdy board book edition enables young readers to count to twelve with Miss Spider as she looks for insect friends to play with, in an early reader&#39;s counting book that features bold illustrations and adapted, simplified text.</p><p>Kirk has studied painting for more than twenty years, starting in junior high school.

The country's people still lived under a feudal system like that of Europe in the Middle Ages. But everything began to change when American Commodore Perry and his troops sailed to the Land of the Rising Sun, bringing with them new science and technology, and a new way of life.</p></p><p><p>Rhoda Blumberg has written about the opening of Japan (1853-1854) in Commodore Perry in the <em>Land of the Shogun,</em> a Newbery Honor Book, which also won the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award and the Golden Kite Award. Her acclaimed histories also include <em>The Incredible Journey of Lewis &amp; Clark, The Great American Gold Rush,</em> and <em>The Remarkable Voyages of Captain Cook,</em> all ALA Notable Books. She is the winner of the <em>Washington Post/</em>Children's Book Guild Award for her overall contribution to nonfiction.</p><p>Rhoda Blumberg says that while doing research for <em>Commodore Perry,</em> "I read about the ordeals and strange adventures of Manjiro, then spent years replaying his life story in my mind until I felt impelled to write about him."</p><p>The author and her husband, Gerald, live in Yorktown Heights, New York.</p>Grade 5 Up Blumberg's book succeeds on two levels. First it is a well-written story of Matthew Perry's expedition to open Japan to American trade and whaling ports. The account is sensitive to the extreme cultural differences that both the Japanese and Americans had to overcome. Especially good are the chapters and paragraphs explaining Japanese feudal society and culture. The text is marvelously complemented by the illustrations, almost all reproductions of contemporary Japanese art, underscoring the unbiased approach of the book. On the second level, the book is a well-researched chronicle of the events of the trip. Blumberg has gone to the original sources to capture the sights, emotions, reactions and even tastes of both the Japanese and Americans. Yet she has not neglected the political and economic importance or mission of Perry's trip. The notes, appendixes and bibliography show a carefully thought out book which holds valuable information for sophisticated readers. There is no better book for students on this historical event.

Ragano started practice as the prot&#x201a;g&#x201a; of a prominent Tampa criminal defense attorney, Pat Whittaker. Soon, he ingratiated himself with Trafficante, Whittaker's principal client, then became Trafficante's full-time lawyer, defending the mob boss and his associates in occasional criminal cases, tweaking the Florida authorities, and passing time in the Mafioso's Havana gambling clubs. Arrested by Castro's men in 1959, Trafficante was saved from almost certain execution by the lawyer's intervention, and by 1961, Trafficante had brought Ragano into contact with Jimmy Hoffa, hoping that Ragano's influence would induce Hoffa to make loans to the mob from the Teamsters' pension funds. In 1963, Hoffa, hard pressed by Bobby Kennedy's ``Get Hoffa'' squad, asked Ragano to tell Trafficante and New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello to kill John Kennedy. Ragano relayed the message, and, after the union boss's five-year prison term for jury tampering, he tried in vain to persuade Hoffa not to reenter union activities until Hoffa's 1975 disappearance. Ragano writes that in a 1987 conversation, Trafficante confirmed to Ragano that he was privy to CIA contracts to kill Castro, that he and Marcello had conspired to kill Kennedy, and that mobsters at the behest of Hoffa's successor, Ed Fitzsimmons, murdered Hoffa. Ragano's prominence as a lawyer ended with convictions for tax evasion, disbarment, a brief reinstatement as an attorney, and another conviction for tax violations. Ragano is presently serving a one-year term. An insider's impossible-to-put-down account of life within the ``Honorable Society.'' -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Ragano was attorney to Florida mobster Santo Trafficante as well as one of Jimmy Hoffa's personal lawyers. He devotes the earlier part of his book to detailing his starry-eyed admiration of Trafficante, whose activities in Florida centered around the widely accepted game of bolita. Ragano gradually became aware of Trafficante's wider mob activities and affiliations, but by then his loyalty had been secured. He tells of his boss's success with Havana casinos, Trafficante's near execution when Castro took over, and his mysterious escape back to Miami. Alternating between first-person and omniscient points of view, Ragano also writes of defending Jimmy Hoffa on fraud charges; his awareness of the conflict between Hoffa, the mob, and the Kennedys; and his unwitting role in the alleged conspiracy to assassinate JFK. He offers detailed accounts of Hoffa's last day as well as a plot to murder Castro. As Ragano drops names (e.g., the obligatory Sinatra story) and juicy tidbits of gossip, the narrative takes on a decidedly tabloid tone. The book is a quick read, and there's no denying its fascination, but one is left feeling slightly soiled and doubting Ragano's veracity on certain key points. For popular true crime collections.

His other books include <i>The Book of God</i>, <i>Ragman and Other Cries of Faith</i>, and <i>Miz Lil and the Chronicles of Grace</i>.Wangerin�s allegory of good and evil pits Chauntecleer, the mighty rooster, against the nefarious and serpentine Wyrm. In a time before humans, Chauntecleer is the only one who stands in the way of Wyrm as it breaks free from its earthly prison and enacts its devious influence upon the innocent animals of the world. Wangerin�s prose proves enjoyable despite a heavy-handed religious overtone. Paul Michael enlivens the text with a deep, robust voice that keeps a good pace. He does justice to the verbose and powerful persona of Chauntecleer. However, inexplicably, he adds a Southern twang to many of the characters� speaking parts, which does not seem to be justified by the text.

Delsol charges that it is not&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;proclaim human rights as a sort of incantation but that, rather, one must understand what sort of being the human person is if humans are to be genuinely respected.

The attack had been savage and merciless. The murder caused shock waves in her native France and in the quiet Cork countryside that she had chosen as her retreat from the high-flying lifestyle of the film business in which she and her husband mixed. Six years later, and despite an extensive investigation, the killer of Sophie is still at largeand the file remains open. Death in December is the fascinating and compelling story of how an independent and beautiful woman sought peace and sanctuary and instead found violence and the ultimate terror. It gives a chilling profile of the killer whom pyschologists believe will strike again.</p><p>Michael Sheridan has combined a career as a journalist with that of theatre director. He has written extensively on the Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder and the Garda investigation.

Ross&#39;s theory attracted artists, Arts and Crafts artisans, and architects, and helped shape architectural education, scholarship, and museum practices.

O'Brien</i></p>14 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>How to Watch a Movie</h2><p><p>From one of the most admired critics of our time, brilliant insights into the act of watching movies and an enlightening discussion about how to derive more from any film experience.<br><br> Since first publishing his landmark <i>Biographical Dictionary of Film </i>in 1975 (recently released in its sixth edition), David Thomson has been one of our most provocative authorities on all things cinema. Now he offers his most inventive exploration of the medium yet: guiding us through each element of the viewing experience, considering the significance of everything from what we see and hear on-screen&#x2014;actors, shots, cuts, dialogue, music&#x2014;to the specifics of how, where, and with whom we do the viewing. <br><br> With customary candor and wit, Thomson delivers keen analyses of a range of films from classics such as <i>Psycho</i> and <i>Citizen Kane</i> to contemporary fare such as <i>12 Years a Slave</i> and <i>All Is Lost,</i> revealing how to more deeply appreciate both the artistry and (yes) manipulation of film, and how watching movies approaches something like watching life itself. <br><br>Discerning, funny, and utterly unique, <i>How to Watch a Movie</i> is a welcome twist on a classic proverb: Give a movie fan a film, she&#x2019;ll be entertained for an hour or two; teach a movie fan to watch, his experience will be enriched forever.</p></p><p><b>DAVID THOMSON </b>has written about film for <i>The Guardian, The Independent,</i> <i>The New York Times, The New Republic, Salon, Movieline, Film Comment,</i> and <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i>. He is the author of more than thirty books on film, including <i>The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles, </i>and <i>The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood. </i>He lives in San Francisco.1 &nbsp;<br>ARE WE HAVING FUN?<br><br>Some people believe film critics are cold-blooded. Whereas many audiences hope to come away from a movie shaking with fear, helpless in mirth, or simply bursting with happiness, a critic sneaks away from the show, a little hunched, with a secretive smile on his face. It&#x2019;s almost as if the film were a bomb, or a&nbsp;<i>bombe,</i>&nbsp;an artful explosion, and the critic was a secret agent who had planted it and now takes a silent pride in the way it worked. And how it worked. Audiences believe they deserve a good time, and some feel that dismantling the machine can get in the way of the fun.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s some people&#x2014;thank God it&#x2019;s not you. If it were you, you wouldn&#x2019;t be holding me in your hand or your lap, ready to read a book about how to watch a movie. Your being here suggests you feel the process is tricky enough to bear examining. In the first sixty years or so of this medium, the cinema behaved as if pleasure was its thing, and its only thing; but in the sixty years since, new possibilities have emerged. One is that pictures are not just mysteries like&nbsp;<i>The Maltese Falcon</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>The Third Man,</i>&nbsp;but mysteries like&nbsp;<i>Blow-Up</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Persona,</i>or&nbsp;<i>Magnolia</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>Amour,</i>&nbsp;which ask, well, what&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;is happening, what do these cryptic titles mean, and what are those frogs in&nbsp;<i>Magnolia</i>&nbsp;meant to be? There is something else: a wave of generations now think some movies might be as fine as anything we do, as good as ice cream or Sondheim, things you can&#x2019;t get out of your&nbsp;head, where watching (or engagement) becomes so complex and lasting that you may welcome guidance.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the 1960s, when &#x201c;film study&#x201d; first took hold in academia, there were well-meaning books that tried to explain what long shots and close-ups were, with illustrations, and what these shots were&nbsp;<i>for.</i>Such rules were at best unreliable. They felt as if assembled by thought police, and they depressed anyone aroused by the loose&nbsp;<i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>&#x2013;like impulsiveness on screen. I pick that film because it&#x2019;s symptomatic of a sixties energy in movies, a feel for danger and adventure: hang on, this is a bumpy ride, and should we be having such fun killing people? Is it a genre film about 1932 or some cunning way of talking to 1967?<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m more interested in discussing&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;experience: the way film is real and unreal, at the same time; what a shot is, or can be, and a cut; how we work up story from cinematic information and the helpless condition of voyeurism; what sound does (its apparent completion of realism, as well as its demented introduction of music in the air); the look of money in movies (no art has ever been as naked about this, or such a prisoner to it); the everlasting controversy over who did what; and the myth known as documentary (is it salvation or just another story-telling trick?).<br> &nbsp;<br> More than that, the ultimate subject of this book is watching or paying attention (that encompasses listening, fantasizing, and longing for next week) and so it extends to watching as a total enterprise or commitment. Driving can be fun, too, and its passionate progress resembles movies&#x2014;its motion is emotional. But a driver has to watch not just driving, but the road, the light, the weather, and the unexpected action of strangers. So as well as discussing movies, I will speculate on reading, looking at paintings, watching wildlife at the beach, or the wilder life in people close to you, and the total matter of how we see ourselves in life. It comes to this: a hundred and fifty years ago, people lived a life and referred it to books, games, and works of moral instruction. But in the time since then we have&nbsp;acquired this mechanism that mimics the way we attend to the world as a whole. Often enough, it supplants living, to say nothing of moral instruction. So we watch, but we watch ourselves watching.<br> &nbsp;<br> Think of these models: there is watching as surveillance, or bearing dispassionate witness: you see waves breaking on the shore; you see flowers bloom and wither; you see your own infants become adults. This watching takes years; it lasts out your life. And it dismisses most schemes of judgment, even if that lesson takes time. But then something happens in the spectacle: one wave coming in bears a body&#x2014;is it a corpse or a mermaid? That flower you&#x2019;re seeing is picked by a good-looking person. Your child is doing something dangerous. The melodrama of story begins, and movies cling to melodrama.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once upon a time, movies had elementary and appealing mysteries or quests in their shape. Like &#x201c;the lost girl.&#x201d; So many movies had that mythic pursuit: in&nbsp;<i>Way Down East,</i>&nbsp;Lillian Gish plays a fallen woman&#x2014;can she be rescued? In&nbsp;<i>Sunrise,</i>&nbsp;Janet Gaynor is a wife on the edge of being murdered&#x2014;will she be saved? In&nbsp;<i>City Lights,</i>&nbsp;the tramp loses the blind girl once she can see. In&nbsp;<i>Casablanca,</i>&nbsp;Ingrid Bergman was lost to Humphrey Bogart, but here she comes again&#x2014;can she save him? In&nbsp;<i>Out of the Past,</i>&nbsp;Mitchum loses Jane Greer, but then he has the bad luck to meet her again.&nbsp;<i>Gone Girl</i>&nbsp;is about a wife who has vanished, leaving the husband to explain the black hole.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then something shifted in the potential of the myth, as movies became more searching. Finding the girl, or saving her, was no longer a simple means to happiness. In&nbsp;<i>Vertigo,</i>&nbsp;Jimmy Stewart falls in love with a lost soul, and loses her, but then her twin appears&#x2014;is this to save him or destroy him? In&nbsp;<i>L&#x2019;Avventura</i>&nbsp;a woman goes missing and we search for her...until we forget the search because there is a new woman. In&nbsp;<i>Persona,</i>&nbsp;a great actress stops dead one night onstage&#x2014;and a nurse takes her over. In&nbsp;<i>Chinatown,</i>&nbsp;the full tragedy hits when the lost girl is rescued. And then in Luis Bu�uel&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>That ObscureObject of Desire,</i>&nbsp;a man&#x2019;s search for a magical woman is confounded because there are two of her. (The way there were in&nbsp;<i>Vertigo</i>?) That&#x2019;s&nbsp;a brief history of the movies in which the message is not just &#x201c;aren&#x2019;t movies fun?&#x201d; but &#x201c;are you watching closely enough?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> You&#x2019;d better be, because these days, as you know, a carefree state of mind usually means you are being watched.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> There are so many ways of watching&#x2014;and so many definitions of what a movie might be. You can observe as a helpless onlooker, even one as neutral or powerless as a camera. But when the camera&#x2019;s detached record is examined, many watchers may say, &#x201c;Look&#x2014;look at the power of the camera!&#x201d; Sometimes to understand that power we have to watch someone watching.<br> &nbsp;<br> Already, I&#x2019;ve used words that require attention. Take &#x201c;fun&#x201d; as a starter. It&#x2019;s the automatic assumption of many people still that we go to the movies for &#x201c;fun,&#x201d; though others say the &#x201c;entertainment&#x201d; industry has done its best in the last few decades to kill that habit. But &#x201c;entertainment&#x201d; is another tricky word. It easily translates into having or being given &#x201c;a good time,&#x201d; and over its history the business has described that as escapism, relaxation, getting away from real life and its insoluble problems for ninety minutes&#x2014;taking it easy in the midst of a life that can be unbearable.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Preston Sturges&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Sullivan&#x2019;s Travels</i>&nbsp;(1942), we meet a very successful Hollywood director, John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), who has had hits like&nbsp;<i>Ants in Your Pants of&nbsp;1939.</i>&nbsp;But he&#x2019;s troubled&#x2014;the look of vexation on McCrea&#x2019;s swell face is one of the film&#x2019;s first comic delights. He wants to be serious, to have respect and...books written about him? He yearns to encounter real life and put its tough tales on screen. So he dresses up as a hobo and goes on the road. To cut a long story short, he ends up sentenced to six years on a chain gang in the South. (Hard stuff now&#x2014;worse in 1942.)<br> His life there is grim and without prospects. But on Sunday the prisoners are taken to a nearby church for a movie show. They see a&nbsp;Disney cartoon, starring Pluto, and Sully starts to laugh along with the other no-hopers and feel better.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, Sturges is a great director, and this film is a merry satire on Hollywood and pretentiousness, as well as a sweetly organized comedy. Moreover, it was made at a desperate time across the world in which the relief of movies was as treasured as it has ever been. And there is Sturges warning filmmakers against undue gravity and self-importance. Why not let the chumps laugh and have a good time? I like that attitude (I was born in 1941 and grew up in a strange nostalgia for the war and its uneasy deal with happiness), and I still cling to the hope that there can be good movies that entertain nearly everyone without being stupid or dishonest.<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t forget that, even in 1940&#x2013;45, the world was making some of its best and most enduring pictures&#x2014;<i>The Shop Around the Corner</i>&nbsp;by Ernst Lubitsch;&nbsp;<i>The Lady Eve,</i>&nbsp;another Preston Sturges picture;&nbsp;<i>His Girl</i>&nbsp;<i>Friday</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>To Have and Have Not</i>&nbsp;by Howard Hawks;&nbsp;<i>The Letter</i>&nbsp;by William Wyler;&nbsp;<i>The Maltese Falcon</i>&nbsp;by John Huston;&nbsp;<i>Laura</i>by Otto Preminger;&nbsp;<i>Meet Me in St.&nbsp;Louis</i>&nbsp;by Vincente Minnelli.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those Hollywood pictures easily qualify as &#x201c;entertainments&#x201d; and they were all popular successes. But the list can be expanded to include riskier ventures from dangerous times and other countries:&nbsp;<i>Henry V</i>&nbsp;by Laurence Olivier;&nbsp;<i>Rome, Open City</i>&nbsp;by Roberto Rossellini;&nbsp;<i>Les Enfants du</i>&nbsp;<i>Paradis</i>&nbsp;by Marcel Carn�;&nbsp;<i>The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</i>&nbsp;by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger;&nbsp;<i>Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne</i>&nbsp;by Robert Bresson; and even&nbsp;<i>Citizen Kane</i>&nbsp;by Orson Welles. Not all of those were hits, or comfortable to watch. Yet they have passed into history as classics because enough people have become accustomed to expecting films to be more than fun. They might be art, too. Don&#x2019;t be put off by that word: art can be appealing and informing (another word for entertainment). It can be fun, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that &#x201c;fun&#x201d; covers film in the war years adequately. In 1945, British and American military film crews went into concentration&nbsp;camps that had just been liberated: Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, Buchenwald. Russian crews had been at Auschwitz. The footage shot in those places was not fun, yet it was reasonable to say it demanded to be seen. Film has that power: seeing can be believing. Under Sidney Bernstein of the Psychological Warfare Division, the British planned a filmed report to be called &#x201c;German Concentration Camps Factual Survey.&#x201d; Alfred Hitchcock was one of the professionals called in to help on the project. The footage is hideous, terrifying, and the record of a turning point in human history, as well as necessary evidence. It is worse than anything you have seen before, yet absolutely essential.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, in the recovery effort after the war, the authorities determined that the planned film risked upsetting viewers and deterring progress and reconciliation. So it was shelved. The material would not be seen widely until 2014, when Andr� Singer released&nbsp;<i>Night Will Fall,</i>&nbsp;a documentary that describes the 1945 attempt. It is still something everyone should see, and watch and talk about.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are situations in our lives where the way we watch the world may be necessary for the continuation of life.&nbsp;<i>How to Watch a</i>&nbsp;<i>Movie</i>is a guide to studying film, and having more fun and being more moved. But watching is a defining part of citizenship, a bearing witness. Ordinary Germans who lived close to the camps elected not to &#x201c;see&#x201d; them. Some of the most striking scenes in&nbsp;<i>Night Will Fall</i>&nbsp;are of those citizens being marched through the stench, the horror, and the neighborliness of the camps. If you can&#x2019;t or don&#x2019;t watch, you have no chance of knowing what is happening, and film&#x2014;in all its uses&#x2014;offers some prospect of seeing the facts. For while the camera is a machine, you are not.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> These days, a movie can be as short as ninety seconds, and you may find it just four inches by three on your computer. I am going to&nbsp;propose in this book that our old defnition of &#x201c;a movie&#x201d; is nearly worn out. For decades, we had a shared sense of the word: a movie was something made, advertised, playing at your local theater; it was ninety minutes (once), and now it is over two hours; it tells a story according to certain conventions we all used to understand. But now...<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, those conventions are in turmoil, and a lot of people don&#x2019;t actually go to see &#x201c;a movie,&#x201d; but they watch movie, or moving pictures, which can be a friend making faces at you on an iPhone, television commercials, some weird twenty-second dream you find on the Net; or the eighteen-inning game between the Giants and the Nationals (2014), which has an apparent unity or story, but is also a chaos of fragments because of the ads, the graphics, and the slow-motion analyses. All of this and much more counts as &#x201c;movie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was arguing with a friend as to whether Columbia University should confer an honorary degree on Derek Jeter, the longtime shortstop for the New York Yankees who was then nearing the climax to his farewell season, 2014. My friend felt Jeter was a natural candidate; I was less sure, even if my doubts were fixed on the rationale behind honorary degrees as a whole. But then another friend asked if I had seen Jeter&#x2019;s Gatorade spot. I went to YouTube for one of the most artful pieces of moviemaking of the year.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a small movie, and as old-fashioned as Tyrone Power, in black-and-white, and shot on a fine summer day. The &#x201c;golden&#x201d; patina of the imagery suggests well-being, contentment, and humidity-free bliss. This is added to by a persistent stress in the imagery so that it keeps surging from right to left in terms of camera movement, its line of action or the destiny of its hero. These devices have been used in movies for a hundred years, though some viewers hardly notice them because they are emotionally transported by their momentum.<br> &nbsp;<br> The character here is Derek Jeter&#x2014;tall, still young, with a shaved head, a simple collarless shirt, and an easygoing, genial regard. He is in a cab, on his way to a game at Yankee Stadium (a trip he has made&nbsp;thousands of times, if seldom in a cab). Then he stops the driver and says he&#x2019;ll walk the rest of the way.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not sure how often Derek has done this in life, and I&#x2019;m sure that on his journeys to the park Frank Sinatra&#x2019;s &#x201c;My Way&#x201d; was not playing in the air. But Sinatra&#x2019;s assurance now harmonizes with the warmth of the image and the thrust of its direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> People notice Jeter&#x2014;he is famous all over the country, never mind in the Bronx.

There she discovers secrets that no child should ever know, and a legacy of shame that can be healed only when she returns to Haiti--to the women who first reared her. What ensues is a passionate journey through a landscape charged with the supernatural and scarred by political violence, in a novel that bears witness to the traditions, suffering, and wisdom of an entire people.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, May 1998</b>: "I come from a place where breath, eyes and memory are one, a place from which you carry your past like the hair on your head. Where women return to their children as butterflies or as tears in the eyes of the statues that their daughters pray to." The place is Haiti and the speaker is Sophie, the heroine of Edwidge Danticat's novel, "Breath, Eyes, Memory." Like her protagonist, Danticat is also Haitian; like her, she was raised in Haiti by an aunt until she came to the United States at age 12. Indeed, in her short stories, Danticat has often drawn on her background to fund her fiction, and she continues to do so in her debut novel. <p> The story begins in Haiti, on Mother's Day, when young Sophie discovers that she is about to leave the only home she has ever known with her Tante Atie in Croix-des-Rosets, Haiti, to go live with her mother in New York City. These early chapters in Haiti are lovely, subtly evoking the tender, painful relationship between the motherless child and the childless woman who feels honor bound to guard the natural mother's rights to the girl's affections above her own. Presented with a Mother's Day card, Tante Atie responds: "'It is for a mother, your mother.' She motioned me away with a wave of her hand. 'When it is Aunt's Day, you can make me one.'" Danticat also uses these pages to limn a vibrant portrait of life in Haiti from the cups of ginger tea and baskets of cassava bread served at community potlucks to the folk tales of a "people in Guinea who carry the sky on their heads." </p><p> With Sophie's transition from a fairly happy existence with her aunt and grandmother in rural Haiti to life in New York with a mother she has never seen, Danticat's roots as a short-story writer become more evident; "Breath, Eyes, Memory" begins to read more like a collection of connected stories than a seamlessly evolved novel. In a couple of short chapters, Sophie arrives in New York, meets her mother, makes the acquaintance of her mother's new boyfriend, Marc, and discovers that she was the product of a rape when her mother was a teenager in Haiti. The novel then jumps several years ahead to Sophie's graduation from high school and her infatuation with an older man who lives next door. Unfortunately, this is also the point in the novel where Danticat begins to lay her themes on with a trowel instead of a brush: Sophie's mother becomes obsessed with protecting her daughter's virginity, going so far as to administer physical "tests" on a regular basis--testing which leads eventually to a rift in their relationship and to Sophie's struggle with her own sexuality. Soon the litany of victimization is flying thick and fast: female genital mutilation, incest, rape, frigidity, breast cancer, and abortion are the issues that arise in the final third of the novel, eventually drowning both fine writing and perceptive characterization under a deluge of angst. </p><p> Still, there is much to admire about "Breath, Eyes, Memory," and if at times the plot becomes overheated, Danticat's lyrical, vivid prose offers some real delight. If nothing else, this novel is sure to entice readers to look for Danticat's short stories--and possibly to sample other fiction from the West Indies as well. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>&#34;Danticat has created a stirring tale of life in two worlds: the spirit-rich land of her ancestry, whose painful themes work their way through lives across generational lines, and her adopted country, the United States, where a young immigrant girl must negotiate cold, often hostile terrain, even as she spars with painful demons of her past.&#34;--Emerge</p><h2>Duel in the Wilderness</h2><p>Young Major George Washington must deliver a message from the king of England to the French commanders in the Ohio wilderness.

H. the Prince of Wales Watercolours</h2><p>A collection of more than seventy watercolor works painted during the last five years by the Prince of Wales reveals his concern for the environment and conservation</p><p>Prince Charles, who has been painting for 23 years, calls his watercolors 'immediate and very amateur," and most of them do seem to function best as personal souvenirs of farms, windmills, cottages and rugged landscapes. Yet in some of the 73 paintings reproduced here he proves much more than a mere literalist. One need only look at the Turneresque beauty of Looking Towards Mar Lodge in the Rain, the dancing Dufyesque color of Andraitxyes.gs Harbour or the delicate shimmering poetry of Countryside Around Abbeystead. The prince's chatty, unpretentious facing-page commentaries accompany each plate. Along with atmospheric vistas of the English and Scottish countrysides are often serendipitous views of Italy, France, the Turkish coast, a Hong Kong bay and an ancient Jordanian city. Nature's majesty quietly shines through in the best of these pictures. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The watercolor sketches of the British traveler are a familiar form of recording sights and scenes. Working in this long tradition, not unlike his forebear Queen Victoria, Prince Charles has produced a charming portfolio of images depicting the countryside he knows so well and has been making strong efforts to preserve. The works are small, intimate, and well realized. The writing is less polished; although an attempt is made to familiarize the reader with the locales and give a bit of background, the ingenuous style is unfortunate. In general, though, the book is well done. Its proceeds are to go to the Prince of Wales's favorite charities, the protection of the environment and architectural preservation. This is primarily for public libraries.<br><i>-Paula Frosch, Metropolitan Museum of Art Lib., New York</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>At Bertram&#39;s Hotel (Agatha Christie Mystery Collection)</h2><p>A typically exciting Agatha Christie, mystery that keeps the reading guessing until the end.</p><p></p><h2>Jorge Luis Borges: Selected Non-Fictions</h2><p>A third and last volume in an important centenary edition of the collected works in English of one of the century&#39;s most respected literary figures offers more than 150 of Borges&#39;s nonfiction works, in wonderful new translations.</p><p>Jorge Luis Borges was our century's greatest miniaturist, perpetually cramming entire universes onto the head of a pin. Yet his splendid economy, along the wafer-thin proportions of such classic volumes as <i>Ficciones</i> and <i>Labyrinths</i>, has given readers the impression that Borges was miserly with his prose. In fact, he was something of a verbal spendthrift. His collected stories alone run to nearly 1,000 pages. And his nonfiction output was even more staggering: the young Borges cranked out hundreds of essays, book notes, cultural polemics, and movie reviews, and even after he lost his sight in 1955, he continued to dictate short pieces by the dozens. Eliot Weinberger has assembled just a fraction of this outpouring in <i>Selected Non-Fictions</i>, and the result is a 559-page Borgesian blowout, in which the Argentinean fabulist takes on being and nothingness, James Joyce and Lana Turner, and (surprisingly) racial hatred and the rise of Nazism. So much for our image of the mandarin bookworm! The very <i>engag�</i> author of <i>this</i> book seems more like a subequatorial Camus, with a dash of Siskel and Ebert on the side.<p> <i>Selected Non-Fictions</i> demonstrates just how quickly Borges began wrestling with such brainteasers as identity, time, and infinity. Indeed, the very first piece in the collection, "The Nothingness of Personality" (1922), already finds him fiddling with the self: "I, as I write this, am only a certainty that seeks out the words that are most apt to compel your attention. That proposition and a few muscular sensations, and the sight of the limpid branches that the trees place outside my window, constitute my current I." There are many such meditations here, including "A History of Eternity" (in which Borges maps out his own, disarmingly empty version of the eternal, "without a God or even a co-proprietor, and entirely devoid of archetypes"). But it's more fun--and more revelatory--to see the author venturing beyond his metaphysical stomping grounds. Borges on <i>King Kong</i> is a hoot, and a cornball masterpiece such as <i>The Petrified Forest</i> elicits this terrific nugget: "Death works in this film like hypnosis or alcohol: it brings the recesses of the soul into the light of day." His capsule biographies are a delight, his critiques of Nazi propaganda are memorably stringent, and nobody should miss him on the tango. True, the sheer variety and mind-boggling erudition of <i>Selected Non-Fictions</i> can be a little forbidding. But, taken as a whole, the collection surely meets the specifications that Borges laid out in a 1927 essay on literary pleasure: "If only some eternal book existed, primed for our enjoyment and whims, no less inventive in the populous morning as in the secluded night, oriented toward all hours of the world." Oh, but it does. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>One of the twentieth century's greatest writers, <b>Jorge Luis Borges</b> (1899-1986) published numerous collections of poems, essays, and fiction, Director of the National Library of Buenos Aires from 1955 to 1973, Borges was awarded the degree of Doctor of Letters, <i>honoris causa</i>, from both Columbia and Oxford.

Original.</p><p>This superb novel of contemporary naval aviation by former fighter pilot Carroll (Punk's War) finds Lieutenant Rick "Punk" Reichert training new pilots. One of his most memorable trainees is Lt. Evelyn Greenwood, who earns the call sign Muddy when she taxis an F-14 Tomcat off a runway. A powerful female senator has made it her mission to see that Muddy becomes one of the few women to complete the training, but the senator and her entourage of aides and journalists only succeed in giving Muddy and Punk a headache. Punk's troubles escalate when his best friend dies during a training accident and his engagement breaks up. Despite these somber goings on, Punk and his trainees keep the narrative lively with their frequent boozing, partying and wisecracking. On September 11th, however, the laughs subside and the action begins when Punk and his cohorts are shipped off to fly against the Taliban. Carroll's fictional account of the aerial attack will set readers' adrenaline and testosterone racing, and his depiction of Muddy's introduction to combat (and her subsequent discovery that she can do it) is a poignant touch. With the public's renewed focus on the men and women serving in the military, this top-flight tale should have widespread appeal. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Finally somebody got it right. -- <i>Stephen Coonts</i><br><br>For readers of military fiction who want some brains with their boom. -- <i><i>Baltimore Sun</i></i></p><h2>Return of the Exile (Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy, Vol. 3)</h2><p>The third title in a trilogy that explores the south of the Dragonlance world after the War of Souls.<br><br>Return of the Exile concludes a trilogy that centers on Linsha Majere, the grandchild of one of the central characters in the entire Dragonlance saga.

Tolkien reluctantly set aside his now greatly elaborated work on the myths and heroic legends of Valinor and Middle-earth and began The Lord of the Rings. This fifth volume of The History of Middle-earth, edited by Christopher Tolkien, completes the presentation of the whole compass of his writing on those themes up to that time. Later forms of the Annuals of Valinor and the Annals of Berleriand had been composed, The Silmarillion was nearing completion in a greatly amplified version, and a new map had been made; the myth of the Music of the Ainur had become a separate work; and the legend of the Downfall of Numenor had already entered in a primitive form, introducing the cardinal ideas of the World Made Round and the Straight Path into the vanished West. Closely associated with this was the abandoned time-travel story, The Lost Road, which was to link the world of Numenor and Middle-earth with the legends of many other times and peoples. A long essay, The Lhammas, had been written on the ever more complex relations of the languages and dialects of Middle-earth; and an etymological dictionary had been undertaken, in which a great number of words and names in the Elvish languages were registered and their formation explained - thus providing by far the most extensive account of their vocabularies that has appeared.</p><p>The History of Middle-earth 5<br>Edited by Christopher Tolkien<br>INKLINGS OF GREATNESS . . . <br>J.R.R.

Now he brings his insight into the workplace, in a book sure to change the shape of business for decades to come.<br><br>In <b>Working with Emotional Intelligence</b>, Goleman reveals the skills that distinguish star performers in every field, from entry-level jobs to top executive positions. He shows that the single most important factor is not IQ, advanced degrees, or technical expertise, but the quality Goleman calls emotional intelligence. Self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-control; commitment and integrity; the ability to communicate and influence, to initiate and accept change&#x2014;these competencies are at a premium in today's job market. The higher up the leadership ladder you go, the more vital these skills become, often influencing who is hired or fired, passed over or promoted. As Goleman shows, we all possess the potential to improve our emotional intelligence&#x2014;at any stage in our career. He provides guidelines for cultivating these capabilities&#x2014;and also explains why corporate training must change if it is to be effective.</p><p><i>Working With Emotional Intelligence</i> takes the concepts from Daniel Goleman's bestseller, <i>Emotional Intelligence</i>, into the workplace. Business leaders and outstanding performers are not defined by their IQs or even their job skills, but by their "emotional intelligence": a set of competencies that distinguishes how people manage feelings, interact, and communicate. Analyses done by dozens of experts in 500 corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations worldwide conclude that emotional intelligence is the barometer of excellence on virtually any job. This book explains what emotional intelligence is and why it counts more than IQ or expertise for excelling on the job. It details 12 personal competencies based on self-mastery (such as accurate self-assessment, self-control, initiative, and optimism) and 13 key relationship skills (such as service orientation, developing others, conflict management, and building bonds). Goleman includes many examples and anecdotes--from Fortune 500 companies to a nonprofit preschool--that show how these competencies lead to or thwart success. <p> Unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can keep growing--it continues to develop with life experiences. Understanding and raising your emotional intelligence is essential to your success and leadership potential. This book is an excellent resource for learning how to accomplish this. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>The secret of success is not what they taught you in school. What matters most is not IQ, not a business school degree, not even technical know-how or years of expertise. The single most important factor in job performance and advancement is emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is actually a set of skills that anyone can acquire, and in this practical guide, Daniel Goleman identifies them, explains their importance, and shows how they can be fostered.<p>For leaders, emotional intelligence is almost 90 percent of what sets stars apart from the mediocre. As Goleman documents, it's the essential ingredient for reaching and staying at the top in any field, even in high-tech careers. And organizations that learn to operate in emotionally intelligent ways are the companies that will remain vital and dynamic in the competitive marketplace of today -- and the future.</p><p>Comprehensively researched, crisply written, and packed with fascinating case histories of triumphs, disasters, and dramatic turnarounds, Working with Emotional Intelligence may be the most important business book you'll ever read.</p></p><h2>WileyPLUS with Loose-Leaf Print Companion</h2><p>This book has to do with Microbiology.</p><p></p><h2>Shaker: Life, Work, and Art</h2><p>Briefly traces the history of the Shakers, describes their lifestyle, and looks at Shaker furniture, architecture, boxes, brooms, fabric, clothing, and equipment</p><p>June Sprigg has been Curator of Collections at the Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

As Niels Bohr said, if you weren&#x2019;t shocked by quantum theory, you didn&#x2019;t really understand it. For most people, quantum theory is synonymous with mysterious, impenetrable science. And in fact for many years it was equally baffling for scientists themselves. In this tour de force of science history, Manjit Kumar gives a dramatic and superbly written account of this fundamental scientific revolution, focusing on the central conflict between Einstein and Bohr over the nature of reality and the soul of science. This revelatory book takes a close look at the golden age of physics, the brilliant young minds at its core&#x2015;and how an idea ignited the greatest intellectual debate of the twentieth century. 16 pages of photographs</p><p>Manjit Kumar has degrees in physics and philosophy and has written for Slate, The Guardian, the Times Literary Supplement, The Independent, and New Scientist.

In this audiobook, complicated scientific theorems and, at times, almost mind-bendingly complex discussions regarding elements, atomic weights, experiments, and chains of formulae are easily dealt with by Ray Porter, who demonstrates a relaxed familiarity with technical matter. Porter re-creates the lives and times of the great scientists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Marie Curie, and Ernest Rutherford, among others, who played their parts in the advancement of this dynamic new physics.

A middle-aged woman is bouncing along on a bus in Buenos Aires, reading and reflecting on Psalm 1. A young Korean executive, on his way home to Seoul from a business trip in Singapore, flies above the clouds at 35,000 feet, reading and pondering the words of the apostle Paul in Romans 5. And in a dorm room in San Diego, California, a young college student polishes off another Mountain Dew and then looks back down at her lap-top computer to finish reading Mark&#x2019;s account of how Jesus miraculously calmed a raging storm on the Sea of Galilee.<br>People all over the world love reading the Bible&#x2014;and they have loved it for thousands of years. Why? People read the Bible because it is a fascinating book, filled with gripping stories and challenging exhortations. People read it because it is an important book, dealing with the big issues of life&#x2014;God, eternal life, death, love, sin, and morals. People read it because they believe that in the Bible God speaks to them through written words. The Bible encourages us, lifts our spirits, comforts us, guides us, chides us, builds us up, gives us hope, and brings us close to the living God.<br>Some parts of the Bible are easy to understand, but much of it is not. Most Christians, however, desire to understand all of God&#x2019;s Word, not just the easy portions. Many of us want to be able to dig deeper into that Word. We want to see more and to understand more of the biblical text. We also want to know that we understand the Bible correctly. That is, we want to be confident that we can pull the actual truth out of a text and not just develop an arbitrary, fanciful, or incorrect interpretation. Our book is designed for such people. The process of interpreting and grasping the Bible is similar to embarking on a journey. Reading the text thoroughly and carefully lies at the beginning of the journey. From this careful reading we become able to determine what the passage meant in the biblical context&#x2014;that is, what it meant to the biblical audience. Often, however, when we try to apply this meaning directly to ourselves, we run into problems. We are separated from the biblical audience by culture and customs, language, situation, and a vast expanse of time. These differences form a barrier&#x2014;a river that separates us from the text and that often prohibits us from grasping the meaning of the text for ourselves. If that were not enough, the Old Testament widens the river by adding another major interpretive barrier that separates us from the audience. Between the Old Testament biblical audience and Christian readers today lies a change in covenant. We as New Testament believers are under the new covenant, and we approach God through the sacrifice of Christ. The Old Testament people, however, were under the old covenant, and for them the law was central. In other words, the theological situation for the two groups is different. There is a covenant barrier between the Old Testament audience and us because we are under different covenants.<br>Thus, the river between the Old Testament text and us consists not only of culture, language, situation, and time, but also of covenant. We have much more in common with the New Testament audience; yet even in the New Testament, the different culture, language, and specific situations can present a formidable barrier to our desire to grasp the meaning of the text. The river is often too deep and too wide simply to wade across.<br>As a result, today&#x2019;s Christian is often uncertain about how to interpret much of the Bible. How should we understand Leviticus 19:19, which prohibits wearing a garment made of two types of material? Does this mean that obedient Christians should wear only 100 percent cotton clothes? In Judges 6:37 Gideon puts out a fleece in order to confirm what God had told him. Does this mean that we should put out fleeces when we seek God&#x2019;s leading? Passages in the New Testament are not always much clearer. For example, Peter walks on the water in Matthew 14:29. Does this mean that we should attempt to walk on water in our obedience to Christ? If not, what does it mean and how can we apply it to our lives today? Even if we cannot walk on water, how do we cross the river that separates us from the text?<br>Any attempt to interpret and to apply the Bible involves trying to cross the river. While often unconscious of their interpretive method, many Christians today nonetheless frequently employ an intuitive or feels-right approach to interpretation. If the text looks as if it could be applied directly, then they attempt to apply it directly. If not, then they take a spiritualizing approach to the meaning&#x2014;an approach that borders on allegorizing the biblical text (which shows little or no sensitivity to the biblical context). Or else they simply shrug their shoulders and move on to another passage, ignoring the meaning of the text altogether.<br>Such approaches will never land us safely on the other side of the river. Those using the intuitive approach blindly wade out into the river, hoping that the water is not more than knee deep. Sometimes they are fortunate and stumble on to a sandbar, but often they step out into deep water, and they end up washed ashore somewhere downstream. Those who spiritualize, by contrast, try to jump the river in one grand leap, but they also end up washed ashore downstream with their intuitive buddies. Shrugging or ignoring a passage is to remain on the far side of the river and simply to gaze across without even attempting to cross.</p><h2>I Am Charlotte Simmons: A Novel</h2><p><p>Dupont University--the Olympian halls of learning housing the cream of America's youth, the roseate Gothic spires and manicured lawns suffused with tradition . . .

Later that day, the editor calls to tell Wolfe they are cutting the salutation off the top of the memorandum, printing the rest as-is. Thus, New Journalism was arguably born, whereby writing and storytelling techniques previously utilized only in fiction were radically applied to nonfiction.

Text written by Andrew Solway.Grade 3-7-How can an illustrator convey "the glory that once was Rome" to modern children when dealing with a landscape of weathered columns and wisteria? In City (Houghton, 1974), David Macaulay draws viewers in through carefully rendered close-ups of a fictitious, ancient site in the planning and design stages, brick by brick. These detailed cutaways and cross-sections deconstruct. Here, Biesty exposes the underground passages of the Colosseum, the bull being sacrificed in the Temple of Jupiter, the lack of privacy in the public restrooms, and the activity in both a wealthy politician's home and in a street scene. Life at the docks, baths, races, and Forum is interpreted by a cast of thousands and with touches of humor. The text consists of a brief narrative for each spread as it describes a festival-day routine through the movements of a senator and his son. Numerous labels, packed with information, are connected to the colorful panoramas. There is no bibliography, but the facts and re-creations are consistent with authoritative sources.

I could almost hear her voice, with its strong Irish brogue, as I sat on the sofa and sipped a glass of lemonade on a hot July day.<br>Frankly, I rather wished that Satan would find me something to do with my idle hands because I was dying of boredom. All my life I&#x2019;d been used to hard work, forced to care for my father and three young brothers after my mother went to her heavenly rest. (At least I presume that&#x2019;s where she went. She certainly thought she deserved it.) And now, for the first time in my life, I was a lady of leisure. Ever since I found out I was in the family way, back in February, Daniel had treated me as if I was made of fine porcelain. For the first few months I was glad of his solicitous behavior toward me as I was horribly sick. In fact I began to feel more sympathy for my mother, who had gone through this at least four times. But then, at the start of the fourth month, a miraculous change occurred. I awoke one morning to find that I felt well and hungry and full of energy. Daniel, however, still insisted that I did as little as possible, did not exert myself, took no risks, and generally behave like one of those helpless females I so despised.<br>He wanted me to lie on the couch with my feet up and spend my days making little garments. I had tried to do this and the quality of my sewing and knitting had improved, but still left a lot to be desired. Besides, I knew that my mother-in-law was sewing away diligently and that my neighbors Sid and Gus would shower the child with expensive presents.<br>So this left long hours to be filled every day. Our little house on Patchin Place could be cleaned in a couple of hours. I did a little shopping, but Daniel&#x2019;s job as a police captain meant that he was seldom home for lunch and sometimes not even for dinner, so little cooking was required. I was glad of this when the weather turned hot at the end of June as my growing bulk meant that I felt the heat badly. Daniel suggested that he could fend for himself just fine and I should go up to his mother in Westchester County, where I&#x2019;d be cooler and well looked after. I didn&#x2019;t say it out loud but I&#x2019;d rather have endured a fiery furnace than a prolonged stay with Daniel&#x2019;s mother. Not that she was an ogre or anything, but her standards of perfection and her social interactions with members of high society left me feeling hopelessly inadequate. I knew that she was disappointed that Daniel had not made a better match than an Irish girl with no money and no family connections.<br>She never actually came out and said this, but she made it plain enough. &#x201c;I took tea with the Harpers yesterday,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;I remember that one of the Harper girls was rather sweet on you at one time, Daniel. She&#x2019;s gone on to make an excellent marriage with one of the Van Baarens. Her parents couldn&#x2019;t be happier.&#x201d; And then she&#x2019;d look at me.<br>So I was prepared to endure any amount of heat rather than Daniel&#x2019;s mother. I just wished these last months would hurry up and be over. I put down my lemonade glass and picked up the undershirt I had been attempting to sew. I could see sweaty fingerprints on the fine white cotton and several places where the stitches had been unpicked. I sighed. I just wasn&#x2019;t cut out to be a seamstress. As a detective I hadn&#x2019;t done at all badly, but that profession was now closed to me. Daniel had made me promise that I&#x2019;d give up my agency when we married. I had hoped that Daniel would share his cases with me, that we&#x2019;d sit at the kitchen table and he&#x2019;d ask for my opinion. But he had claimed that his recent cases had been too commonplace to be worth discussing or else so confidential that he had to remain tight-lipped about them.<br>I looked up as the sun suddenly streamed in through the back parlor windows. A sunbeam lit the dust motes in the air and painted a stripe of brightness on the wallpaper. Now this room would soon be too hot for comfort and I&#x2019;d be banished to the front parlor, dark and gloomy, until the sun set. I got up to draw the heavy velvet drapes across the window and noticed that the lace curtains looked rather dingy. That would never do. Having achieved lace curtains for the first time in my life, I should make sure that they remained a pristine white. I went into the kitchen and brought back a high-backed wooden chair. I proceeded to climb on this with some difficulty, then I reached up to unhook the first of the lace curtains.<br>I was at full stretch, standing on tiptoe, when a voice behind me boomed, &#x201c;Molly! What in God&#x2019;s name do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,&#x201d; I exclaimed. I teetered, and would have fallen if I hadn&#x2019;t grabbed at the velvet drape, which held fast. I looked around to see Daniel standing there with a face like thunder.<br>&#x201c;The curtains needed washing.&#x201d; I glared at him defiantly.<br>&#x201c;You were risking the safety of our baby for the sake of clean curtains?&#x201d; he demanded. He came over and helped me down from the chair. &#x201c;You nearly fell, and what might have happened then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was only a voice suddenly shouting right behind me that made me lose my balance,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Until you showed up I was doing just fine.&#x201d;<br>He looked at me more tenderly now. &#x201c;Molly, how many times have I told you to take it easy. You&#x2019;re in a delicate condition, my dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Women in Ireland have their babies one day and by the end of the week they&#x2019;re out helping their man in the fields again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And how many of those babies die? Your mother didn&#x2019;t live long herself, did she?&#x201d;<br>I chose not to acknowledge the truth in this. Instead I said breezily, &#x201c;Daniel, I feel fine and I&#x2019;m bored to tears doing nothing.&#x201d;<br>He took my arm and led me back to the sofa. &#x201c;Then invite some friends over to tea. I&#x2019;ve introduced you to the wives of some of my colleagues, haven&#x2019;t I? It&#x2019;s about time you built up a circle of social acquaintances. And there are always your friends across the street,&#x201d; he added grudgingly, not being as keen as I on my bohemian neighbors.<br>I sighed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve gone to stay with Gus&#x2019;s relatives in Newport, Rhode Island, to escape the heat,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You remember the mansion with the Roman pillars.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d spent our honeymoon in Newport and it had hardly gone as planned. Daniel pulled up the kitchen chair and sat beside me. &#x201c;So why don&#x2019;t you go to my mother as I suggested? You know she&#x2019;d love to make a fuss of you, and feed you well, and it&#x2019;s so much cooler out there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Daniel, I&#x2019;m your wife. My place is taking care of you,&#x201d; I replied, not wanting to tell him the real reason. Isn&#x2019;t it amazing what marriage does to a woman? I was finally learning to be diplomatic. I was one step away from being simpering.<br>&#x201c;I can fend for myself quite well. I&#x2019;ve been doing it for years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you work long hours, Daniel. It&#x2019;s not right that you should come home to no supper and no clean clothes.&#x201d;<br>He wagged a finger at me. &#x201c;What have I been telling you for months? Then this is the perfect time to get a servant.&#x201d;<br>I sighed. &#x201c;Daniel, let&#x2019;s not go through that again. We really don&#x2019;t need a servant. This is a small house. I&#x2019;m used to hard work. I&#x2019;m happy to cook and clean for you, and for our baby too. If a few more children start to come along, then I may need some help, but for the present....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just the amount of work, Molly. It&#x2019;s the principle of the thing. A man in my position should have a servant. When we start entertaining more, it wouldn&#x2019;t be right that you&#x2019;d have to keep disappearing into the kitchen to see to the dinner. I want you to be the gracious hostess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; I said, my rising temper now winning out over my newfound meekness. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not concern about me at all, is it? You&#x2019;re worried about how you appear in the eyes of society.&#x201d;<br>He looked at my expression and took my hand. &#x201c;Molly, this is not for myself, it&#x2019;s for us. Everything I do from now on is for my family. I want the best for us and for our children. I want to rise in the world, it&#x2019;s true, and I&#x2019;ll be judged on the kind of home I keep and the people I associate with.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;And I want the world to see that I married a beautiful woman.&#x201d;<br>I had to smile at this. &#x201c;You may have been born in America, Daniel Sullivan,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve certainly inherited your share of Irish blarney!&#x201d;<br>He smiled too. &#x201c;I am thinking of you, Molly. If you&#x2019;re up all night with a crying baby, you&#x2019;ll appreciate a girl taking over from you so you can get your rest. You say you&#x2019;re bored and have nothing to do&#x2014;well, what better time to train a servant so that she knows your wishes and how this household works by the time the baby arrives?&#x201d;<br>I hesitated, then said, &#x201c;Well, I suppose I could start making inquiries.&#x201d;<br>He jumped to his feet. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I write to my mother and ask for her help in this?&#x201d;<br>Now my hackles truly were rising. &#x201c;Why does your mother have to come into every aspect of our lives?&#x201d; I demanded. &#x201c;Do you not believe I&#x2019;m capable of finding a servant for myself?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course you are. I&#x2019;m simply trying to spare you extra toil and bother. I don&#x2019;t want you traipsing around the city at this time of year.

As the <i>New York Times</i> put it, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the exceedingly rare place where unabashedly hearty preparations and ingredients meet seasonal produce and whimsical flourishes, where comfort and classicism welcome innovation without letting it run roughshod.&#x201d; Now you can enjoy the charm and the food of The Red Cat in your own kitchen, with Bradley&#x2019;s straightforward, thoroughly satisfying, and fun-to-read first cookbook.<br><br>In Bradley&#x2019;s cuisine, the Italian-American classics of his childhood meet sensible New England accents and the creative energy of Manhattan in dishes like a pristine saut� of zucchini and toasted almonds topped with salty Pecorino Romano cheese; a surprising&#x2014;and surprisingly delicious&#x2014;peach and pancetta risotto; or a lusty prime New York shell steak with Yukon Gold potatoes, fennel, a�oli, and Cabernet.

It sums up a lot of what I think makes a dish comfortable to both cook and diner: a mere handful of ingredients, each contributing its own important flavor and texture; the whole thing held together with a fine extra-virgin olive oil.

His practical regimen, first set forth by <i>The Financial Peace Planner</i>, which will be published by Penguin in January 1998. Loaded with inspirational insights that come from personal experience, this set of books is the most valuable purchase a debt-ridden reader can make.</p><p>The author's own experience with debt and bankruptcy is the backdrop for the story of his journey from financial riches to loss of everything and then to survival when he found new success through his counseling efforts, which are framed by his religious beliefs. Ramsey determined that his personal experience with financial pain was an ideal foundation for a career in assisting consumers in handling debt. The reader learns that it takes considerable sacrifice, discipline, and patience to control money, and Ramsey contends that a huge percentage of Americans, caught in a web of instant gratification, need help in managing their finances. The core of the book reflects on 25 principles, which the author calls "peace puppies," great creatures that are eager to please and love their master but, without discipline, will become wild and mean. These puppies include avoiding the worship of money, giving money away to worthy causes, living substantially below one's income, and laying out written details of a cash-management plan. One caveat: the book concludes with a set of financial worksheets; however, they do provide an excellent introduction to disciplined planning. <i>Mary Whaley</i>As a young and gifted businessman during the real estate decade of the Eighties, Ramsey, who has a Christian radio talk show, made millions; however, when the market eventually collapsed, the author found himself driving a Jaguar with no money for gas. Using the anger he felt from this experience as a catalyst to write this book, Ramsey bypasses advice on stock and mutual fund selection typically found in similar books and takes aim at the behavioral aspects of personal money management. Admonishing the reader to avoid the seductiveness of credit cards, among other things, Ramsey illustrates his strategy for dumping debt, which he considers paramount in realizing financial peace. While here and there he incorporates Christian practice, e.g., in the first chapter he uses prayer for gathering his thoughts and later speaks of tithing and charitable contributions, his work is straightforward and written without financial jargon. This is a firm but necessary slap in the face for individuals and married couples just getting out on their own. Highly recommended for public libraries.?Dennis Krieb, St. Charles Cty.

Nuzum shares from her experiences and God&#39;s Word to help others endure temptation, find strength, experience God&#39;s will, and attain the fullness of life.</p><p>Cornelia Nuzum was born Cornelia Marahall in Greenbrier County, West Virginia on 19th August 1856. She married Staats Nuzum (1858-1904) who was of Irish descent. In 1911, some years after the death of her husband, she became involved in the Home of Peace in Oakland, California which was run by Carrie Judd Montgomery. She also assisted in weekly divine healing meetings with Mrs. Montgomery. She became respected as a writer of articles on faith and healing. From this time through to the 1940s, she was a regular contributor to Mrs Montgomery&#39;s monthly Triumphs of Faith journal. Mrs Nuzum became known for her devotional writings, many which were published as tracts under the name, Mrs. C. Nuzum. A number were collected into her only book publication, The Life of Faith, which was released by Gospel Publishing House in 1928. The Life of Faith has become a classic and has remained in print for almost 80 years. Mrs. Nuzum was associated with the Assembly of God fellowship from 1914. She was greatly blessed in a ministry of healing which is reflected in many of her tracts. Her particular emphasis was always faith and the blood of Jesus.

Here, prisoners are routinely tortured, abused, and violated. Executions are frequent and sudden. But for two women imprisoned for their Christian faith&#x2015;Maryam Rostampour and Marziyeh Amirizadeh&#x2015;this hell on earth was a place of unlikely grace as they reflected God&#x2019;s love and compassion to their fellow prisoners and guards. Against all odds, Evin would become the only church many of them had ever known.<br><br>In <i>Captive in Iran</i>, Maryam and Marziyeh recount their 259 days in Evin. It&#x2019;s an amazing story of unyielding faith&#x2015;when denying God would have meant freedom. Of incredible support from strangers around the world who fought for the women&#x2019;s release.

Though Islamic laws in Iran forbade them from sharing their Christian beliefs, in three years they&#x2019;d covertly put New Testaments into the hands of twenty thousand of their countrymen. They&#x2019;d started two secret house churches, including one for prostitutes&#x2015;many of them women who had been abandoned by their husbands and had no other way to support themselves and their children. Maryam and Marziyeh had almost been caught many times . . . it seemed like divine intervention when they were not.<br><br>But finally&#x2015;perhaps inevitably&#x2015;in 2009, the two young women were arrested and held in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran, a place where inmates are routinely tortured, and executions are swift and sudden. But in the face of chilling interrogations and intimidation, and risking a death sentence, something remarkable happened: Instead of succumbing to fear, they chose to take the radical&#x2015;and dangerous&#x2015;step of sharing their faith inside the very walls of the government stronghold that was meant to silence them.<br><br>In <i>Captive in Iran</i>, Maryam and Marziyeh recount how God used their 259 days in Evin Prison to bring about a miraculous reversal: shining light into one of the world&#x2019;s darkest places, giving hope to those who had lost everything, and showing love to those in despair.<br><br><i>For all we knew, this could be our last day on earth.</i><br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ve been thinking carefully,&#x201d; the interrogator said, nibbling on a piece of bread. &#x201c;Have you?&#x201d;<br><br>I wondered if he knew how hungry we were, or if he always ate in front of prisoners.<br><br>&#x201c;What should we have been thinking of?&#x201d; Maryam asked.<br><br>&#x201c;About telling us what we want to know about you and your activities.

Working diligently day and night to complete it by hand, he titled it <i>The Sea Is My Brother</i>. Now, nearly seventy years later, its long-awaited publication provides fascinating details and insight into the early life and development of an American literary icon.<p>Written seven years before <i>The Town and The City</i> officially launched his writing career, <i>The Sea Is My Brother</i> marks a pivotal point in which Kerouac began laying the foundations for his pioneering method and signature style. A clear precursor to such landmark works as <i>On the Road</i>, <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, and <i>Visions of Cody</i>, it is an important formative work that bears all the hallmarks of classic Kerouac: the search for spiritual meaning in a materialistic world, spontaneous travel as the true road to freedom, late nights in bars and apartments engaged in intense conversation, the desperate urge to escape from society, and the strange, terrible beauty of loneliness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Jack Kerouac</b> was born in 1922 in Lowell, Massachusetts.

Maybe it's the fact that J.K. Rowling doesn't write children's books, she writes children's stories, more in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm than Dr. Seuss. The exploits of Harry and his friends captivate even the shortest attention spans by engaging the imagination with vivid characters and fast-moving action, instead of trying to merely catch the eye with colorful pictures or pop-up effects. Not surprisingly, the Potter tales sound wonderful read aloud, and adapt to the audiobook format extremely well. Broadway actor Jim Dale's impressive vocal range gives each character in the book its own distinctive voice--a considerable task, given the pantheon of witches, warlocks, ghosts, ghouls, dwarves, and elves that Harry encounters in his second outing. And thankfully, since the book is read unabridged, no one's favorite character is omitted. Engaging for children without being childish, the audio version of <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is worthy addition to the deservedly popular series. (Running time: 9 hours, 7 CDs) <i>--Andrew Nieland</i>The Dursleys were so mean that hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. <br>And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. <br>But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><h2>Sombrero Fallout</h2><p>Concerns a writer trying to cope with the break-up of a relationship. Trying to escape his misery, he begins a story about a sombrero that falls out of the sky and lands in a small town. Unable to concentrate he throws the pages in the bin, and that&#39;s when it starts to take on a life of its own.</p><p>Richard Brautigan was born in 1935 in Tacoma, Washington where he spent most of his childhood and teenage years. Sometime in the mid-Fifties Brautigan moved to San Francisco where he published his first volume of poetry. Soon after he wrote some of his most famous novels such as Trout Fishing in America, Sombrero Fallout, A Confederate General from Big Sur and In Watermelon Sugar. As well as five other novels and the collection of short fiction, Revenge of the Lawn, Brautigan was an accomplished poet who had nine volumes of poetry published as well as many other short experimental works. Brautigan&#39;s last novel, So the Wind Won&#39;t Blow Away was published in 1982. He was found dead in 1984, aged 49, beside a bottle of alcohol and a .44 calibre gun.Brautigan&#39;s comic touch is predictably unerring and the hilarious narrative development is studded with wry surreal gags * New Statesman * As always with Mr Brautigan, the more preposterous the situation, the funnier the book * Sunday Telegraph * A born writer ... he can&#39;t be dull * Sunday Times * His style and wit transmit so much energy that energy itself becomes the message.

It&#39;s a much-needed reminder that, like J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s hobbits, we Christians are all on an epic quest. In examining the Christian themes in the trilogy, authors Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware find that truth and fiction are not as far apart as they seem. And that although Tolkien never intended for these books to present the gospel, when read in the light of Scripture they offer a rich tapestry of redemption, values, and faith against all odds from which we may learn much.</p><p>There's more to Middle-earth than meets the eye, argue Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware in <i>Finding God in</i> The Lord of the Rings. J.R.R. Tolkien, a devout Christian, helped bring C.S. Lewis into the faith and met weekly with Lewis and Charles Williams at an Oxford pub for heated religious and literary discussions that informed <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Although Bruner and Ware avoid any simplistic claim that Tolkien's saga is "a covert allegory of the Gospel," the authors assert that the books have evangelistic power because they "can open the heart's back door when the front door is locked." Twenty-one short chapters describe various scenes and themes from Tolkien's work in order to illustrate truths of Christian life.

Chief Minister to Henry VIII, his fortunes have risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry&#x2019;s second wife, for whose sake Henry has broken with Rome and created his own church. But Henry&#x2019;s actions have forced England into dangerous isolation, and Anne has failed to do what she promised: bear a son to secure the Tudor line. When Henry visits Wolf Hall, Cromwell watches as Henry falls in love with the silent, plain Jane Seymour. The minister sees what is at stake: not just the king&#x2019;s pleasure, but the safety of the nation. As he eases a way through the sexual politics of the court, and its miasma of gossip, he must negotiate a &#x201c;truth&#x201d; that will satisfy Henry and secure his own career. But neither minister nor king will emerge undamaged from the bloody theatre of Anne&#x2019;s final days.</p><p><em>In Bring Up the Bodies</em>, sequel to the Man Booker Prize&#x2013; winning <em>Wolf Hall</em>, Hilary Mantel explores one of the most mystifying and frightening episodes in English history: the destruction of Anne Boleyn.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Hilary Mantel on How She Wrote <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em></strong> <br> <p> </p> <p><strong>Origins of the Book</strong></p> <p><em>Bring Up the Bodies</em> is the second part of my trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII. I have been interested in Cromwell for years, and wanted to get beyond the negative portrayal of him in popular history and fiction. He was a ruthless man, certainly, but no more so than other contemporary politicians; and in Henry, a man of violent temper, he had a very demanding employer. As soon as you get back beyond the prejudices about Cromwell, you find a clever, enterprising, resilient and optimistic man, with a story well worth telling. He was at the center of Henry's court for almost ten years, and when you look at events from his point of view, they seem very different from the stories of the Tudor court to which we've grown accustomed. </p> <p>Originally I thought I would tell the story in just one book. But as I made progress with <em>Wolf Hall</em>, I discovered the richness and depth of the material. I was glad to alter my plans. Now the project will reach a conclusion in <em>The Mirror &amp; The Light</em>, the book that is still ahead of me.</p> <p><strong>How is it different from <em>Wolf Hall</em>?</strong></p> <p><em>Wolf Hall</em> takes in a huge span of time, describing Cromwell's early life, and reaching back into the previous century, to show the forces that shaped England before he was born. The foreground action of the book occupies several years, ending in July 1535, on the day of the execution of Cromwell's political antagonist, Thomas More.</p> <p>The action of <em>Bring Up The Bodies</em> occupies only nine months, and within that nine months it concentrates on the three weeks in which Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn, is arrested, tried and executed for treason. So it is a shorter, more concentrated read. There are no diversions once the plot against Anne begins to accelerate, and the tension builds as her death approaches.</p> <p>It's quite possible to read <em>Bring Up The Bodies</em> without reading <em>Wolf Hall</em>. It makes sense in its own terms. But I think a reader will get a deeper experience by starting with the first book and seeing the characters evolve.</p> <br> <p><strong>Space: What's on your desk, in your office, on the walls, outside your window? Describe your writing space. Where do you go when you can't write there?</strong></p> <p>My office is in my apartment on the East Devon coast. Before my desk there is a big window, and beyond that a shingle beach and the sea. On my large pine desk there's just my laptop, my working papers, and my diary, plus a silver dial that tells the time in the world's major cities. I have a mouse mat with the Holbein image of Thomas Cromwell on it; my husband magicked this up from somewhere. I keep my pens and markers in a china pot with a picture of Henry VIII, which came from the National Portrait Gallery in London. On my left there is a whiteboard which I use to plan each chapter as I write, and also to scribble down any fleeting thoughts; if I'm elsewhere in the apartment it's the whiteboard I run to, to catch a phrase I'm afraid might slip away. I can write anywhere, though; I long ago learned to write and polish a paragraph in my head. And I do a lot of work in my notebooks when I'm travelling, shuttling up to London on the train. I write in the car too; in the passenger seat, I should add.</p> <p><strong>Soundtrack: What/who do you listen to? Why? How? (headphones, computer, radio?)</strong></p> <p>I can hear the sea. Nothing else is as good as that. Noise doesn't distract me, necessarily, but if I put on music I quickly blank it out. </p> <p><strong>Tools: Pens? Notebook? Computer (Mac or PC)? Special software?</strong></p> <p>Most of my work originates in longhand. I like writing by hand but I have 2 sorts of handwriting; one is quite decorative, and the other is as plain as possible and as legible as possible, my note-taking hand which I use when I copy from a document. At a certain stage I rip up my notebooks and shuffle the pages into some sort of order in ring-binders; from those I work straight on to my pc. I&#x2019;ve been writing on the screen since 1986, at which point I was into my third book. But I'm old enough to remember the toil in the days of typewriters and messy, smudgy carbon copies.</p> <p><strong>Words: What are you reading? Do you read anyone to prime the pump, so to speak? Or to escape your own writing?</strong></p> <p>On the whole I prefer not to read fiction when I'm hard at work on my own writing, because I find it difficult to make the commitment a novel requires, to enter into someone els's imaginary world. Instead I devour newspapers and read books on medicine, psychology, social studies. But much of my reading is tied to research for my Cromwell novels. If I get stuck while I'm writing, if my sentences feel arid, then reading poetry sometimes works. It restores some essential sense of rhythm.</p> <p><strong>Inspiration: Do you do anything to get inspired? Exercise? Walk? Nap? Hobbies?</strong></p> <p>Two almost infallible methods for me. If I'm stuck part way through developing a scene, I get into the shower. When you are dripping water, that's when the words start to flow: at the moment of maximum inconvenience. For bigger problems, going to sleep is good. Fresh material swims up as I wake.</p> <p>If everything is out of proportion, if I'm overwhelmed and mentally tired, a walk by the sea helps. I've always wanted to live by the sea and thought it would be good for me, and the last year's work on <em>Bring Up The Bodies</em> seems to have proved it. This time last year, the book was just a few boxes of notes.</p> <br> <p><em>Photo credit: Francesco Guidicini</em></p><p>Hilary Mantel is the author of fourteen books, including A PLACE OF GREATER SAFETY, BEYOND BLACK, the memoir GIVING UP THE GHOST, and the short-story collection THE ASSASSINATION OF MARGARET THATCHER.

Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal</h2><p>A study of the evolution of the modern computer profiles the work of MIT psychologist J. C. R. Licklider, whose visionary dream of a &#34;human-computer symbiosis&#34; transformed the course of modern science and led to the development of the personal computer. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>While it's true that no one person's vision encompassed all of what we now consider personal computing, we can't help but focus on individual effort as we try to understand how we got here. Science writer M. Mitchell Waldrop carefully balances this hero culture with a historian's mania for completeness in <i>The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal</i>.<p>"Lick," as his students and colleagues called him, was deeply involved in guiding the evolution of personal and networked computing from the 1950s through the 1980s, after leaving a career in cognitive psychology. Waldrop captures his spirit vividly--contrary to our stereotypical view of computer scientists, Licklider was profoundly interested in his fellow humans, and this interest helped him lead the design of technology adapted to human needs.</p><p>Waldrop interviewed dozens of contemporaries and examined reams of notes and primary sources to compose this massive biography of influence that stretches from MIT to the Pentagon to Xerox PARC and far beyond. If it sometimes seems that Licklider was a little too well beloved, especially in comparison to some of the more colorful figures in computing's recent history, it is worth remembering that his patience and humility were the very qualities that helped deliver the home-computing revolution we take for granted today. If we had to choose just one 20th-century computer pioneer that we couldn't do without, it would have to be the man behind the Dream Machine. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>M. Mitchell Waldrop, formerly a senior writer at <i>Science</i> magazine, is the author of <i>Complexity</i> and <i>Man-Made Minds</i>.</p><h2>Dear America: Down the Rabbit Hole</h2><p>Newbery Honor author Susan Campbell Bartoletti brings the story of a young girl caught up in a web of murder, lies, and the Great Fire of Chicago to bold life.<br>In the spring of 1871, fourteen-year-old Pringle Rose learns that her parents have been killed in a terrible carriage accident. After her uncle Edward and his awful wife, Adeline, move into the Pringle family's home -- making life for her and her younger brother, Gideon, unbearable -- Pringle runs away with Gideon to Chicago, seeking refuge from the tragedy, and hoping to start a new life. She becomes a nanny for the children of a labor activist, and quickly finds herself caught up in a web of intrigue and lies. Then, when a familiar figure from home arrives, Pringle begins to piece together the devastating mystery of what happened to her parents, and realizes just how deadly the truth might be. But soon, one of the greatest disasters this country has ever known -- the Great Fire of Chicago -- flares up, and Pringle is on the run for her life.</p><p>Susan Campbell Bartoletti is the award-winning and critically acclaimed author of many books, both fiction and nonfiction, for children. Her fiction includes the novels THE BOY WHO DARED, Dear America: A COAL MINER&#39;S BRIDE, and NO MAN&#39;S LAND, as well as a number of picture books. She won the Newbery Honor for her nonfiction book HITLER&#39;S YOUTH. A former eighth-grade teacher for eighteen years, Bartoletti now writes full-time and lives in Pennsylvania with her family.Gr 4-7-Pringle Rose and her brother, Gideon, who has Down's syndrome, have had a privileged upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1871. Their parents' death in a suspicious carriage accident changes everything. Gideon survives, but has not spoken since the accident. On a visit to the cemetery, Pringle meets Rabbit, for whom she develops romantic feelings. The siblings' uncaring Uncle Edward and his vicious wife move in, and when it becomes clear that they plan to send Gideon away, Pringle plans their escape. On the way to Chicago, they befriend Gwen Pritchard, a woman traveling with her children in the same train car, and their closeness is solidified after they survive a terrifying crash. When their mother's friend is unable to provide refuge, Pringle and Gideon find a home with the Pritchards. As Pringle learns more about the conditions of mine workers, she begins to rethink what her father, a mine owner, taught her. When they learn the truth about their parents' accident and the role Rabbit played, Gideon runs away. As Pringle tries to find him, the Chicago Fire rages. The epilogue sums up the rest of their story, and the historical note provides context and inspiration. Readers will enjoy this novel with its multiple historical events and engaging personal story.-Kefira Phillipe, Nichols Middle School, Evanston, IL&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character.

Fadlan belatedly discovers that his job is to combat the terrors in the night that come to slaughter the Vikings--but just how he will do it, Fadlan has no idea....<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Michael Crichton takes the listener on a one-thousand-year-old journey in his adventure novel <i>Eaters Of The Dead</i>. This remarkable true story originated from actual journal entries of an Arab man who traveled with a group of Vikings throughout northern Europe. In 922 A.D, Ibn Fadlan, a devout Muslim, left his home in Baghdad on a mission to the King of Saqaliba. During his journey, he meets various groups of "barbarians" who have poor hygiene and gorge themselves on food, alcohol and sex. For Fadlan, his new traveling companions are a far stretch from society in the sophisticated "City of Peace." The conservative and slightly critical man describes the Vikings as "tall as palm trees with florid and ruddy complexions." Fadlan is astonished by their lustful aggression and their apathy towards death. He witnesses everything from group orgies to violent funeral ceremonies. Despite the language and cultural barriers, Ibn Fadlan is welcomed into the clan. The leader of the group, Buliwyf (who can communicate in Latin) takes Fadlan under his wing. <p> Without warning, the chieftain is ordered to haul his warriors back to Scandinavia to save his people from the "monsters of the mist." Ibn Fadlan follows the clan and must rise to the occasion in the battle of his life. The unabridged story is read by actor Victor Garber (<i>Titanic</i>; <i>The First Wives Club</i>), who brings life and a personality to the plot--convincingly portraying each character with appropriate accents. Crichton also sets the stage in the beginning and chimes in every so often to clarify historical places and events. If you love historical action thrillers, but are short on time, this audio book packs an epic journey into a three hour adventure. <i>--Gina Kaysen</i> (<i>Running time: 3 Hours; 2 cassettes</i>)</p><p>From the bestselling author of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, an epic tale of unspeakable horror</p><p>The year is A.D. 922.&nbsp; A refined Arab courtier, representative of the powerful Caliph of Baghdad, encounters a party of Viking warriors who are journeying to the barbaric North.

There was no danger for anyone now except Porfirio Cava. The dice had stopped rolling. A three and a one. Their whiteness stood out against the dirty tiles.</p><p>&#x201c;Four,&#x201d; the Jaguar repeated. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; Cava muttered. &#x201c;I said four.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get going, then. You know which one, the second on the left.&#x201d;</p><p>Cava felt cold. The windowless latrine was at the far end of the barracks, behind a thin wooden door. In other years the wind had only got into the barracks of the cadets, poking through the broken panes and the cracks in the walls, but this year it was stronger and hardly any place in the academy was free from it. At night it even got into the latrines, driving out the stink that accumulated during the day, and also the warmth. But Cava had been born and brought up in the mountains, cold weather was nothing new to him: it was fear that was giving him goose pimples.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it over?&#x201d; the Boa asked. &#x201c;Can I go to bed?&#x201d; He had a huge body, a deep voice, a shock of greasy hair over a narrow face. His eyes were sunken from lack of sleep, and a shred of tobacco dangled from his jutting lower lip. The Jaguar turned and looked at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to go on guard at one,&#x201d; the Boa said. &#x201c;I want to grab a little sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead, both of you,&#x201d; the Jaguar said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wake you up at five to.&#x201d;</p><p>Curly and the Boa went out. One of them tripped on the threshold and swore.</p><p>&#x201c;Wake me up as soon as you get back,&#x201d; the Jaguar said to Cava. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t take too long. It&#x2019;s almost midnight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know it.&#x201d; Usually Cava&#x2019;s face was expressionless, but now it looked exhausted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get dressed.&#x201d;</p><p>They left the latrine. The barracks was dark, but Cava could find his way along the two rows of double bunks without a light: he knew that long, tall room by heart. It was silent except for a few snores and murmurs. His bunk was the second on the right, about a yard from the outside door. As he groped in his locker for his trousers and his khaki shirt and his boots, he could smell the tobacco-sour breath of Vallano, who slept in the upper bunk. Even in the darkness he could make out the double row of the Negro&#x2019;s big white teeth, and they reminded him of a rat. Slowly, quietly, he took off his blue flannel pajamas and got dressed. He put on his wool jacket and went down to the Jaguar&#x2019;s bunk at the other end of the barracks, next to the latrine, walking carefully because his boots squeaked.</p><p>&#x201c;Jaguar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Here, take them.&#x201d;</p><p>Cava&#x2019;s hand reached out and touched two hard, cold objects, one of them rough. He kept the flashlight in his hand and slipped the file into his pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s on guard?&#x201d; Cava asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Me and the Poet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Slave&#x2019;s taking my place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the ones from the other sections?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you scared?&#x201d;</p><p>Cava did not answer. He tiptoed to the outside door and opened it as carefully as he could, but it still creaked on its hinges.</p><p>&#x201c;A crook!&#x201d; somebody shouted in the darkness. &#x201c;Kill him, sentry!&#x201d;</p><p>Cava could not recognize the voice. He looked out into the patio. It was completely empty in the dim light from the lamps around the parade ground, which lay between the barracks and a weed-grown field. The drifting fog obscured the outlines of the three cement hulks where the Fifth Year cadets were quartered, making them look unreal. He went outside and stood for a few moments with his back against the barracks wall. He could not count on anyone now: even the Jaguar was safe. He envied the sleeping cadets, the noncoms, the soldiers in their barracks at the other side of the stadium. He knew he would be paralyzed by fear unless he kept going. He calculated the distance: he had to cross the patio and the parade ground; then, protected by the shadows in the field, he had to skirt the mess hall, the offices and the officers&#x2019; quarters; and finally he had to cross another patio&#x2014;this one small and paved with cement&#x2014;that faced the classroom building. The danger would end there, because the patrol never went that far. Then, the trip back to his barracks. In a confused way he wanted to lose his will and imagination and just carry out the plan like a blind machine. Sometimes he could go for several days following a routine that made all the decisions for him, gently nudging him into actions he hardly noted. This was different. What was happening tonight had been forced on him. He felt unusually clearheaded and he knew perfectly well what he was doing.</p><p>He began to walk, keeping close up to the wall. Instead of crossing the patio he went around it, following the curved wall of the Fifth&#x2019;s barracks. When he came to the end of it he looked around anxiously: the parade ground seemed vast and mysterious, outlined by the symmetrically-placed lamps around which the fog was gathering. He could picture the shadowy field beyond the lamps. The sentries liked to stretch out there, either to sleep or to talk in whispers, when it was not too cold. But he was sure that tonight they were all gambling in one of the latrines. He began to walk quickly in the shadows of the buildings on his left, avoiding the splotches of light. The squeaking of his boots was drowned by the crash of the surf against the cliffs bordering one side of the Academy grounds. When he reached the officers&#x2019; quarters he shivered and walked even faster. Then he cut across the parade ground and plunged into the shadows of the field. A sudden movement near him, as startling as a blow, brought back all the fears he had begun to overcome. He hesitated for a moment; then he could make out the eyes of the vicu�a, as bright as glowworms, regarding him with a wide, gentle stare. &#x201c;Get out of here!&#x201d; he said to it angrily. The animal remained motionless. That damned thing never sleeps, Cava thought. It doesn&#x2019;t even eat. What keeps it alive? He moved on. Two and a half years ago, when he came to Lima to finish school, he was amazed to find that creature from the mountains wandering calmly among the gray, weather-beaten walls of the Leoncio Prado Military Academy. Who had brought the vicu�a to the Academy? From what part of the Andes? The cadets used him as a target, but the vicu�a hardly paid any attention when the stones hit him. He simply walked away from the boys with a look of utter indifference. It looks like an Indian, Cava thought. He went up the stairs to the classrooms. He was not worried now about the sound of his boots: the building was empty except for the desks and the benches, the wind and the shadows. He crossed the upper lobby with long quick strides. Then he stopped. The faint beam of the flashlight showed him the window. The second on the left, the Jaguar had said. And yes, he was right, it was loose. Cava started gouging out the putty with the pointed end of the file, collecting it in his other hand. It felt damp and decayed. Then he carefully removed the pane of glass and laid it on the tile floor. He groped until he found the lock, and swung the window wide open. Inside, he turned his flashlight in every direction. On one of the tables, next to the mimeograph machine, there were three stacks of paper. He read: Bimonthly Examination in Chemistry, Fifth Year. Examination Time, 40 Minutes. The sheets had been mimeographed that afternoon and the ink was still somewhat moist. He copied the questions hurriedly into a notebook without understanding what they meant. He turned off the flashlight, went back to the window, climbed up and jumped. The pane of glass exploded into hundreds of strident splinters. &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; he grunted. He remained crouching, listening, trembling with terror. But he could not hear the wild tumult he expected, the pistol-shot voices of the officers: only his own panting. He waited for a few more seconds. Then, forgetting to use the flashlight, he picked up the broken glass as well as he could and put it into his pockets. He walked back to his barracks without taking the slightest precaution. He wanted to get there as soon as he could, he wanted to climb into his bunk and shut his eyes. As he crossed the field he took the broken glass out of his pockets and threw it away, cutting his hands as he did so. He stopped for a moment in the doorway to his barracks, catching his breath. A dark shape loomed up in front of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay?&#x201d; the Jaguar asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go in the latrine.&#x201d;</p><p>The Jaguar went first, pushing at the double door with both hands. In the yellow light Cava could see that the Jaguar was barefoot, could see and smell his big pale feet with their long dirty toenails.</p><p>&#x201c;I broke the glass,&#x201d; he said in a low voice.</p><p>The Jaguar&#x2019;s hands came at him like two white claws and fastened on the lapels of his jacket. Cava swayed backward but kept his eyes on those of the Jaguar, who was glaring at him from below his curled-up lashes.</p><p>&#x201c;You peasant,&#x201d; the Jaguar muttered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a peasant. If they catch us, by God I&#x2019;ll...&#x201d;</p><p>He was still holding on to the lapels, so Cava put his hands on the Jaguar&#x2019;s, timidly trying to loosen them.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your hands off!&#x201d; the Jaguar said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a peasant!&#x201d; Cava could feel the spit spraying his face. He lowered his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t anyone in the patio,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t see me.&#x201d;</p><p>The Jaguar released him and stood nibbling the back of his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m not a squealer, Ja...</p></p><h2>The Insufferable Gaucho (New Directions Books)</h2><p><p><strong>A trove of strange, arresting, short masterworks &#x2015; five stories and two essays &#x2015; by Roberto Bolano, a writer who pulls bloodthirsty rabbits out of his hat.</strong></p> As Pankaj Mishra remarked in <em>The Nation</em>, one of the remarkable qualities of Bolano&#x2019;s short stories is that they can do the &#x201c;work of a novel.&#x201d; <em>The Insufferable Gaucho</em> contains tales bent on returning to haunt you. Unpredictable and daring, highly controlled yet somehow haywire, a Bolano story might concern an elusive plagiarist or an elderly lawyer giving up city life for an improbable return to the family estate, now gone to wrack and ruin. Bolano&#x2019;s stories have been applauded as &#x201c;bleakly luminous and perfectly calibrated&#x201d; (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>) and &#x201c;complex and provocative&#x201d; (<em>International Herald Tribune</em>), and as Francine Prose said in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, &#x201c;something extraordinarily beautiful and (at least to me) entirely new.&#x201d; Two fascinating essays are also included.</p><p><p>Author of <em>2666</em> and many other acclaimed works, <strong>Roberto Bolano</strong> (1953-2003) was born in Santiago, Chile, and later lived in Mexico, Paris, and Spain. He has been acclaimed &#x201c;by far the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time&#x201d; (Ilan Stavans, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>),&#x201d; and as &#x201c;the real thing and the rarest&#x201d; (Susan Sontag). Among his many prizes are the extremely prestigious Herralde de Novela Award and the Premio R�mulo Gallegos. He was widely considered to be the greatest Latin American writer of his generation. He wrote nine novels, two story collections, and five books of poetry, before dying in July 2003 at the age of 50.</p><p>The poet <strong>Chris Andrews</strong>&nbsp;teaches at the University of Western Sydney, Australia, where he is a member of the Writing and Society Research Centre. He has translated books by Roberto Bolano and C�sar Aira for New Directions. He has won the Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize for his poetry and the Valle-Inclan Prize for his translations.</p>Seven tales by the amazingly prolific-in-death Bola�o (2666) explore themes of self-exile and illness. The two best stories concern conflicted Argentinean protagonists; in the title story, Hector Pereda, "an irreproachable lawyer with a record of honesty," leaves Buenos Aires after the death of his wife and the collapse of the country's economy to make a go as a gaucho on the pampas. Inhabiting a ruined ranch, with only the languid locals and predatory rabbits as company, Hector finds a welcome, near-poetic restoration of a society where self-reliance and egalitarianism reign. In "Alvaro Rousselot's Journey," an acclaimed Argentinean novelist sets out for Paris to confront a filmmaker who has blatantly plagiarized his books, though what really eats at the novelist is that the filmmaker has ignored the writer's recent works, leaving him with the sense that "he had lost his best reader." "Rat Police" reflects Bola�o's interest in fantasy and noirish crime fiction, while "Literature + Illness = Illness" is essentially an essay about terminal illness. Andrews is an excellent translator, and even if these are somewhat lesser works in the Bola�o pantheon, completists will snap this up. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this philosophical meditation, the Holy Father reflects on values he deems critical to the destiny of humankind, with freedom and the value of life underlying all others. Pope John Paul II s theological understanding of evil and suffering was forged in the crucible of Nazism and communism in his native Poland, as was his belief in the importance of cultural identity. He points out that "evil, in a realist sense, can only exist in relation to good, and in particular, in relation to God, the supreme Good," which underlies even the darkest moments in history with the promise of redemption and hope. His encounters with those dark moments lend credibility when he writes, "All human suffering, all pain, all infirmity contains within itself a promise of salvation, a promise of joy..." <p> He champions freedom, yet cautions the faithful that when freedom in no longer linked with the truth, it sets the premise for "dangerous moral consequences." The West must overcome its moral permissiveness, he exhorts, listing divorce, free love, abortion, contraception, euthanasia, and genetic engineering as evidence of its degeneration. He also issues a plea for the church, a repository of historical memory, to remember its primary mission: to proclaim the Gospel. </p><p> The world will remember Pope John Paul II for espousing many of the convictions he expresses here: that good is ultimately victorious, life conquers death, and love triumphs over hate. --<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>The pope's 1994 book, <i>Crossing the Threshold of Hope,</i> sold some 20 million copies in more than 30 languages. Both that book and this one grew out of interviews conducted in the early 1990s, but the differences between them are significant. The interviewer for <i>Threshold</i> was an Italian journalist who focused on questions Catholic laypersons might ask; the interviewers for <i>Memory</i> were Polish professors of philosophy. Though advance publicity has focused on the pope's description of the 1981 attempt on his life and on several comments on abortion and homosexuality, most of the book is devoted to rigorous discussion&#x2014;laced with quotations from the Bible, documents of Vatican II and his own poetry&#x2014;about the nature of evil, especially as seen in Nazi and Communist regimes; the nature of freedom, with its concomitant responsibilities; and the challenges facing post-Enlightenment, secular Europe. Praising the medieval church and Thomist philosophy, condemning Cartesian self-sufficiency and modern "unbridled capitalism," the pope upholds tradition (memory) as the basis for individual, religious and national identity. His conclusion is characteristically optimistic: "The evil of the 20th century was... an evil of gigantic proportions, an evil which availed itself of state structures in order to accomplish its wicked work." But "there is no evil from which God cannot draw forth a greater good. There is no suffering which he cannot transform into a path leading to him." <i>(Mar. 27)</i></p><h2>BORN TO RUN</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Bruce Springsteen&#39;s recording career spans more than 40 years.

Clay Wilson, Gilbert Shelton, and other Bay Area misfits first started producing "underground" comics in the '60s, they were considered to be highly innovative in their use of frank sexual themes. However, some 10 to 15 years before they commenced their explicit, often offensive cartoons, another genre of pornographic graphics was dying out, the so-called "Tijuana Bibles" (or sometimes "Cuban Bibles," "French Bibles," etc.). Simon &amp; Schuster has released a collection of these antique obscenities that often featured famous political, show business, or cartoon figures having more fun than mainstream censors would have allowed. The introduction, by comic book apologist and <i>New Yorker</i> comics editor Art Spiegelman, is an amusing and sarcastic look at the history of this lost medium, with some interesting reflections on the genre, noting that "Though there are bound to be those who will loudly declaim that the <i>Tijuana Bibles</i> demean women, I think it important to note that they demean <i>everyone</i> ... it's what cartoons do best." While the reprinted comic strips are often amusing in being laughingly bad, the historical essays and asides by editor Bob Adelman provide fascinating historical context. A sociology of mid-century sexual mores and the love/hate relationship that Americans have with their celebrities is evinced by the combination of reprint and commentary.<b>Bob Adelman</b> is an author, editor, teacher, book producer, and world-renowned photojournalist. His picture stories have frequently appeared in <i>Life,</i> the <i>London Times Magazine, Stern,</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine.</i> In varying roles he has done more than forty books; the most recent are his <i>Carver Country</i> and <i>Visions of Liberty.</i> He vividly recalls his nervous excitement at first gaping at a Tijuana Bible.

The case of the headless corpse is based on a thirteenth-century Chinese casebook; the nail murder, one of the most famous motifs in Chinese crime literature, is first described in the same text.<br><br>"So scrupulously in the classic Chinese manner yet so nicely equipped with everything to satisfy the modern reader."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i><br><br>Robert Van Gulik (1910-67) was a Dutch diplomat and an authority on Chinese history and culture.

Now Donati takes on a new and often overlooked chapter in our nation&#x2019;s past--and in the life of the spirited Bonners--as their oldest daughter, the brave and beautiful Hannah, comes of age with a challenge that will change her forever. Masterfully told, this passionate story is a moving tribute to a resilient, adventurous family and a people poised at the brink of a new century.<br><br>It is the spring of 1802, and the village of Paradise is still reeling from the typhoid epidemic of the previous summer. Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner have lost their two-year-old son, Hannah&#x2019;s half brother Robbie, but they struggle on as always: the men in the forests, the twins Lily and Daniel in Elizabeth&#x2019;s school, and Hannah as a doctor in training, apprenticed to Richard Todd. Hannah is descended from healers on both sides--one Scots grandmother and one Mohawk--and her reputation as a skilled healer in her own right is growing. <br><br>After a long night spent attending to a birth, Elizabeth and Hannah encounter an escaped slave hiding on the mountain. She calls herself Selah Voyager, and she is looking for Curiosity Freeman--a former slave herself, one of the village&#x2019;s wisest women and Elizabeth&#x2019;s closest friend. The Bonners take Selah, desperately ill, to <b>Lake in the Clouds</b> to care for her, and with that simple act they are drawn into the secret life that Curiosity and Galileo Freeman and their grown children have been leading for almost ten years. The Bonners will do what they must to protect the Freemans, just as Hannah will protect her patient, who presents more than one kind of challenge. For a bounty hunter is afoot--Hannah&#x2019;s childhood friend and first love, Liam Kirby.<br><br>While Elizabeth and Nathaniel undertake a treacherous journey through the endless forests to bring Selah to safety in the north, Hannah embarks on a very different journey to New-York City, with two goals: to learn the secrets of vaccination against smallpox, a disease that threatens Paradise, and to find out what she can about Liam&#x2019;s immediate past and what caused him to change so drastically from the boy she once loved. The obstacles she faces as a woman and a Mohawk make her confront questions long avoided about her place in the world. <br><br>Those questions follow her back to Paradise, where she finds that the medical miracle she brings with her will not cure prejudice or superstition, nor can it solve the problem of slavery. No sooner have the Bonners begun to rebound from their losses--old and new--than they find themselves confronted by more than one old enemy in a battle that will test the strength of their love for one another. Hannah faces the decision she has always dreaded: will she make a life for herself in a white world, or among her mother&#x2019;s people?</p><p>PRAISE FOR SARA DONATI:<br><br>&#x201c;Donati&#x2019;s engaging characters, her strong sense of place and the lively escapades pull readers along.&#x201d;<br><i>--Rocky Mountain News<br><br></i>&#x201c;The author [has] a gift for capturing the history and the lives of the people of that time and place.&#x201d;<br><i>--The Tampa Tribune<br><br></i>PRAISE FOR <b>INTO THE WILDERNESS:</b><br><br>&#x201c;Exemplary historical fiction, boasting a heroine with a real and tangible presence.&#x201d;<br><i>--Kirkus Reviews<br><br></i>&#x201c;My favorite kind of book.&#x201d;<br>--Diana Gabaldon, bestselling author of <b>The Fiery Cross</b><i><br></i>Sara Donati lives with her husband and daughter in the Pacific Northwest, where she is at work on her next novel.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Let&#39;s Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood</h2><p>When the ship veered into the Cape of Good Hope, Mum caught the spicy, heady scent of Africa on the changing wind. She smelled the people: raw onions and salt, the smell of people who are not afraid to eat meat, and who smoke fish over open fires on the beach and who pound maize into meal and who work out-of-doors. She held me up to face the earthy air, so that the fingers of warmth pushed back my black curls of hair, and her pale green eyes went clear-glassy.<br><br>&#x201c;Smell that,&#x201d; she whispered, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;<br><br>Vanessa was running up and down the deck, unaccountably wild for a child usually so placid.

Though it is a diary of an unruly life in an often inhospitable place, it is suffused with Fuller&#x2019;s endearing ability to find laughter, even when there is little to celebrate. Fuller&#x2019;s debut is unsentimental and unflinching but always captivating. In wry and sometimes hilarious prose, she stares down disaster and looks back with rage and love at the life of an extraordinary family in an extraordinary time.<br><br>From 1972 to 1990, Alexandra Fuller&#x2013;known to friends and family as Bobo&#x2013;grew up on several farms in southern and central Africa. Her father joined up on the side of the white government in the Rhodesian civil war, and was often away fighting against the powerful black guerilla factions. Her mother, in turn, flung herself at their African life and its rugged farm work with the same passion and maniacal energy she brought to everything else. Though she loved her children, she was no hand-holder and had little tolerance for neediness. She nurtured her daughters in other ways: She taught them, by example, to be resilient and self-sufficient, to have strong wills and strong opinions, and to embrace life wholeheartedly, despite and because of difficult circumstances. And she instilled in Bobo, particularly, a love of reading and of storytelling that proved to be her salvation.<br><br>A worthy heir to Isak Dinesen and Beryl Markham, Alexandra Fuller writes poignantly about a girl becoming a woman and a writer against a backdrop of unrest, not just in her country but in her home. But <b>Don&#x2019;t Let&#x2019;s Go to the Dogs Tonight</b> is more than a survivor&#x2019;s story.

They fall in love, but must then endure the calumny and gossip of the villagers.Yukio Mishima was born into a samurai family and imbued with the code of complete control over mind and body, and loyalty to the Emperor - the same code that produced the austerity and self-sacrifice of Zen. He wrote countless stories and thirty-three plays, in some of which he performed. Several films have been made from his novels, including The Sound of Waves, Enjo which was based on The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Among his other works are the novels Confessions of a Mask and Thirst for Love and the short story collections Death in Midsummer and Acts of Worship. The Sea of Fertility tetralogy, however, is his masterpiece. After Mishima conceived the idea of The Sea of Fertility in 1964, he frequently said he would die when it was completed. On 25 November 1970, the day he completed The Decay of the Angel, the last novel of the cycle, Mishima committed seppuku (ritual suicide) at the age of forty-five.</p><h2>Chicken Soup for the Prisoner&#39;s Soul: 101 Stories to Open the Heart and Rekindle the Spirit of Hope, Healing and Forgiveness (Chicken Soup for the Soul)</h2><p><p>Previously available only through free distribution to prisons, this life-changing book is the result of charitable donations from sales of Chicken Soup for the Christian Family Soul and gifts from thousands of individuals.</p> <p>In the spring of 2000, over 100,000 copies of Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul were distributed to prisoners, prison libraries and prison ministries throughout the United States.

She was talking about her special little girl. Seems this little girl was standing on the front seat of her car the other day, grabbing at the sunrays as they reflected off the windshield. When her mother asked her what she was doing, the little girl said she was trying to catch a sunray for her mom as a present. Both officers agreed on how special moments like that were. The other officer then asked if this mother got to spend time with her special little girl.</p> <p>"No, but when my career gets back on track, I'll have more time to spend with her, when she is older," said the young mother. I wanted to scream and tell her that mother to spend every single second she possibly can with her child, but I couldn't. Maybe after you read what follows, you will better understand.</p> <p>It's the awful truth, as it happened to me. It starts with an unwritten letter -- a letter I can never send:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>Dear Kent,</i></p> <p><i>As I look at you, I see your hair is nicely combed. I remember the hours and gallons of water we used, trying to train your hair. It always seemed to have a mind of its own. I can see that scar on your lip; hardly shows now, too. We were worried about that. You were such a brave little man when I took you to Dr. Nordquist to get those three stitches in it. I was the one who almost fainted when they started sticking you with that needle. The nurse even made me leave the room.</i></p> <p><i>On the way home, I told you that you could have any treat you wanted, for being so brave. You wanted a cup of coffee, "Like big men drink," you said. My five-year-old little brave man, drinking coffee in the Rainbow Restaurant, just like big men. It was our secret; lucky Mom never found out, huh?</i></p> <p><i>You have grown tall and nice looking. Grandpa always said you were going to be a big man. Guess what I'm proudest of in you? It's your kindness to all things. When we found out that your little dog, Porkchop, was epileptic, you were so happy that you cried. You had seen Porkchop have fits many times, and we were sure he would die. For three years after that, you faithfully gave Porkchop his pill every day. </i></p> <p><i>I remember the day you helped me fix my pickup. We sure got greasy -- Mom wouldn't even let us in the house for lunch, but we fooled her. We went to the store and got a pizza, then lipped off to Mom and your two brothers, while eating it, still dirty. Yes, that was fun. We laughed a lot that day. I found out later that you did save a piece of pizza for your little brother; it was our secret too. </i></p> <p><i>I've always been proud of you for so many reasons, Kent. Your silent kindness and strength, your loyalty, your soft heart, and secrets you shared with me. I remember how you used to lay across my lap with your shirt pulled up, exposing your bare back. I would trace my fingers lightly over your skin; it seemed to almost hypnotize you. I had done it many times when you were a baby, to get you to sleep when you weren't feeling good. Guess you just never grew out of liking it. I liked it too.</i></p> <p><i>I remember the day I came to tell you that I was going away for a long time -- going to prison. You stood silently, listening with your head bowed and tears in your eyes, asking why. You hugged me and ran up into the woods, to your secret fort, crying. I cried too that day, Kent. I was ashamed of myself, and of breaking your heart. </i></p> <p><i>You did write me and sent the colored pictures you drew in school. I had them on my cell wall for years, and yes, I bragged about them to my friends. I have lain awake many nights wondering who was teaching you to drive, who was your first girlfriend, and how I would tease you about her, as if I were right there with you. I'm sorry for missing so much of you, Kent.</i></p> <p><i>Love,<br> </i><i>Daddy</i></p> </blockquote> <p>As I stood looking at my special little boy, in a light gray coffin, I was dressed in bright orange coveralls. Prison guards were beside me. I wanted to reach out and touch him just once more, but the chains on my wrists wouldn't allow it. </p> <p>It took a mortician to cover that cut on Kent's lip and get his hair to lay down. I'm so awfully sorry for missing the last eight years of Kent's life. If only I could have another chance to be the daddy he wanted me to be -- the daddy he deserved. If I could just tickle Kent's back once more, or share some secret with him, or tease him and hold him for just a few minutes. God, I would gladly die for the chance.</p> <p>Kent was killed when he was crushed under a tractor in an accident near Kelso, Washington. He is buried in Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, near the only tree there. So, if you are ever near that cemetery, and see a six-foot, five-inch, two hundred and seventy-pound beatup old man on his knees beside that grave, praying to God in shame, you will know why.</p> <p>Hopefully you will better understand why I wish he could have read this letter, while he was alive. There are so many things I should have told him. So much time I should have spent with him. </p> <p>If you have a special child in your life, please don't, for any reason, miss one single second with that child. Don't let what happened to me happen to you. Those moments are so awfully important.</p> <p>To the lady officer, with the special little sunray catcher -- please believe me when I say, "For God's sake, spend every single precious moment with your child, now! This could be your last chance, because sometimes very special children don't get any older."</p> <p> <i>Ken "Duke" Monse'Broten</i></p> <p>Reprinted by permission of Ken "Duke" Monse'Broten �1996.

Bevere explains that understanding the vital role of this virtue will enable readers to attract blessing both now and for eternity.</p><p>John Bevere is a bestselling author and popular conference speaker. He and his wife, Lisa (also a bestselling author), founded Messenger International in 1990. The ministry has grown into a multi-faceted international outreach that includes a weekly television program, The Messenger, which broadcasts in 214 nations. John has authored numerous books, including A Heart Ablaze, Under Cover, The Bait of Satan, and The Fear of the Lord. He and Lisa live in Colorado with their four sons. You can visit John Bevere on the Web at www.messengerintl.org.Bestselling author and international conference speaker Bevere (<i>Driven by Eternity</i> and <i>Bait of Satan</i>) is known for his trademark theme of believing in God for the impossible. Fans won't be disappointed by the similar all things are possible tone in this book on the need to integrate the principle of honor into every aspect of life, both functionally and spiritually. Bevere's focus on the biblical doctrine of honoring those governing authorities, whether in the civil, church, family, and social arena, is substantiated through scripture. Still, many in non-charismatic evangelical churches will take issue with the author's presumptive stance on ministers' right to receive double honor in the form of material wealth. Recounting the numerous times he has witnessed opulent gifts and preferential treatment bestowed upon him and other Christian servants as outward signs of being honored, Bevere provides an endless litany of hotel accommodations, presents, and the like. This reads as distasteful and greedy when contrasted with the fact that even Christ had nowhere to lay his head. The principle of honor is a worthy one, but Bevere's approach deteriorates too frequently into a what's-in-it-for-me tenor. <i>(Nov. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So Du Pr� isn't exactly surprised when she shows up in Toussaint complaining that her current man, a lovable roughneck named Badger, has run off. His longer-than-usual absence has Pauline worried, and Du Pr� promises to look into exactly what sort of trouble he has gotten himself into.<br><br>No one quite imagines, least of all Pauline, that the first thing Du Pr� will find in his investigation is Badger's body, lying in a remote part of the Montana wilderness with a bullet-hole in the base of his skull. Du Pr� has a hunch his old friend and foil Harvey Wallace will be interested in the case-after all, Gabriel Du Pr�'s Montana is teeming with just the sorts of people that tend to interest Wallace's employers, the FBI, and the odds that Badger got mixed up with them seem inordinately high.<br><br>The trail leads straight into the teeming underworld of illegal, remote brush races involving a ragtag bunch of traveling horsemen, with many thousands of dollars wagered upon each race. Forced to go undercover to determine how Badger met his end, Du Pr� finds his own horse and jockey to bet on in another complicated, fascinating outing for Montana's favorite M�tis son. <br>Peter Bowen's tough, rough-edged, likable hero rides again in <i>Stewball</i>, an intricate installment in a classic series by one of the genre's quirkiest and most beloved practitioners.<br></p><p><b>Peter Bowen</b>, a Montanan, writes of the West. Cowboy, hunting and fishing guide, folksinger, poet, essayist, and novelist, he's written the picaresque Yellowstone Kelly historical novels, humor columns and essays on blood sport as Coyote Jack, and the Gabriel Du Pr� mysteries, in part because "the M�tis are a great people, a wonderful people, and not many Americans know anything about them."<br>Badger wasn't a bad guy; he just fell in with the wrong folks and got busted running illegal quantities of prescription drugs down from Canada. The FBI agent who busted him hoped he could lead the feds to the bigger fish in the prescription-drug racket, but Badger ends up with a bullet in his brain. The FBI agent is Harvey Wallace, longtime confederate of Gabe Du Pre, the retired Montana brand inspector and sometime lawman. Turns out Badger was married to Gabe's cousin, so Harvey asks Gabe if he'd like to help catch the bastards who did it, who may be a gang of bent ranchers using the drugs to dope racehorses. Gabe, in turn, enlists the aid of Booger Tom, an ancient cowboy, and Lourdes, his horse-whisperer granddaughter. And, of course, to get into the races, you have to have a horse. That would be Stewball. The twelfth entry in the Du Pre series is as consistently entertaining as its predecessors. Gabe, ever skeptical of the modern world and its institutions, places his faith in people, the land, a hand-rolled smoke, and the occasional ditch-water highball. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He's also a bit of a jerk, which is why, when someone sets up a fake website for his dental practice, Paul has trouble figuring out who is responsible. But a synopsis of <em>To Rise Again at a Decent Hour</em> can hardly do justice to a novel that is constantly changing shape and context. What begins as a stirring questioning of personal identity later evolves into a poignant meditation on the value of community, before transforming again into something entirely different. As with his previous novels, <em>Then We Came to the End</em> and <em>The Unnamed</em>, the paths of Joshua Ferris's narrative intentions are windy and at times unclear.

Wohlmuth created <i>Sisters</i> in 1994, they took America by storm, captivating countless readers with their poignant exploration of sisterhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this beautiful new volume, they turn their empathy and perception to a territory perhaps even more intimate--the intense connection shared by mothers and daughters.<br><br>The profoundly personal experiences of the women portrayed in these original essays and photographs illuminate a relationship that is awe-inspiring in its power and depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these women are well known: Cindy Crawford, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Margaret Atwood, and Jamie Lee Curtis all speak of their own relationships in these pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also wisdom to be found in the words of a ninety-six-year-old great-grandmother with her nine daughters; a mother and daughter who have fled the war in Bosnia for an uncertain future in New York; and a woman who received a kidney transplant as a last gift from her dying mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the speakers are famous or not, their stories and portraits express universal feelings of tenderness, pride, and a love so fierce that it is sometimes painful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mothers and Daughters</i> is a stunning and evocative tribute to this unbreakable bond.</p><p>Carol Saline and Sharon J. Wohlmuth once again explore the familial bonds of women in this charming follow-up to their 1994 smash hit <i>Sisters</i>. In words and pictures, <i>Mothers and Daughters</i> reveals the varied and perennial nature of this complicated family bond. Most of the daughters in this collection are adult women. Some are stepchildren, others adopted from other nations, and still others, including model Cindy Crawford, author Margaret Atwood, and cartoonist Cathy Guisewite, are famous. Wohlmuth's posed, black-and-white photos of the two generations reveal relationships that rival the intensity of romance. In these pictures, some mothers curl protectively around their daughters, some of the women stand side-by-side, embracing like old friends, and occasionally the subjects stand apart from one another, like partners in a difficult marriage. Saline's interviews probe delicately beneath the surface of the portraits. "Do you love your mother, Jacki?" Saline asks one subject, who answers, "without question." But when Saline asks, "Do you <i>like</i> your mother?" Jacki replies more ambiguously: "Well...." This book will inspire mothers and daughters to reflect on the importance of their own relationship. <i>--Maria Dolan</i>"Whenever I see someone on her birthday I make a point to ask her, 'Have you called your mom today and said thank you?'"<br>--Jamie Lee Curtis</p><h2>Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared</h2><p>It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson.

But, as it turns out, Allan is not...Slowly but surely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in his slippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikely journey involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan&#39;s earlier life in which - remarkably - he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century.

Is there a God? How did it all begin? Can we predict the future? What is inside a black hole? Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? How do we shape the future? Will we survive on Earth? Should we colonise space? Is time travel possible? Throughout his extraordinary career, Stephen Hawking expanded our understanding of the universe and unravelled some of its greatest mysteries. But even as his theoretical work on black holes, imaginary time and multiple histories took his mind to the furthest reaches of space, Hawking always believed that science could also be used to fix the problems on our planet. And now, as we face potentially catastrophic changes here on Earth - from climate change to dwindling natural resources to the threat of artificial super-intelligence - Stephen Hawking turns his attention to the most urgent issues for humankind. Wide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, passionately argued, and infused with his characteristic humour, BRIEF ANSWERS TO THE BIG QUESTIONS, the final book from one of the greatest minds in history, is a personal view on the challenges we face as a human race, and where we, as a planet, are heading next.

Everybody loves a good story. We have been reading, listening to, or watching stories all of our lives, so we intuitively know a lot about how they work. Yet, more and more, Christians are unfamiliar with the stories of the Bible and how the grand narrative of God's Word fits together. Indeed, God gave us the stories of the Bible to reveal great truth about Himself and about our lives, and He wants to draw us into the ongoing story of what He is doing in the world. By focusing on the narrative framework of Scripture we can better understand what the Bible teaches and live out its instruction more effectively.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Reading God's Story</i> takes that clear narrative approach to the Bible, arranging the complete text into a fresh chronological reading plan developed for the Read the Bible for Life biblical literacy initiative. In this plan the books, chapters, and verses of the Bible are thoughtfully arranged so readers can track the story of Scripture, day by day, from beginning to end, understanding the flow of events and how all the different parts fit together to make sense.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Reading God's Story</i> features two-color interior page layout and is organized into 52 weeks of readings (six readings per week). It presents Scripture in three main acts (God's Plan for All People; God's Covenant People; God's New Covenant People) and seventeen total scenes, providing an introduction for each act and scene to orient the reader to its importance in the grand story. Unlike other chronological Bibles, this arrangement is not date specific (e.g. "January 1"), so a person can begin using this edition at any point in the calendar year.</p><p>God&#x2019;s Grand Story. Your Story.<br><br>Reading God&#x2019;s Story will take you on a one-year journey through the entire Bible as the events actually unfolded.

In <i>Country Life</i>, Heiney shows the reader what's involved in turning that dream into some kind of reality, working on the basic premise that anyone with the will to do it can bring at least a small portion of home farming into his life, even if it means starting with a small window box in the middle of the city. He presents the basics of home farming, care of livestock, gardening for food, raising field crops, and preparing food from the crops and animals one has raised by hand. Charmingly illustrated with colorful drawings and hundreds of photographs, this book is meant to inspire and motivate the would-be farmer, and it will. <i>--Mark A. Hetts</i>In this lavishly illustrated book, Heiney tells readers how to turn the dream of being a home farmer into a reality. Most of the sample farms he suggests are several acres in size. In the first section, he explains the meaning of home farming and the basic differences between a garden farm and a small, medium, and large home farm. He discusses the various chores season by season, as well as the work involved in hedging, fencing, blacksmithing, and blade sharpening. Other sections of the book deal with animal husbandry and with growing vegetables, herbs, and fruit. He offers information on such topics as barns, stables, and sheds, tractors, horses, restoring ponds, assessing the soil, rotating crops, and plowing. In a section on home comforts, Heiney discusses such delightful subjects as making bread, pastas, cheese, and jams, and curing bacon and ham. Home farming on such a large scale is beyond the scope of most gardeners, but the book is definitely an armchair adventure. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>Edge of Evil</h2><p><p>The end of her high-profile broadcasting career came too soon for TV journalist Alison Reynolds&#x2014;bounced off the air by executives who wanted a "younger face." With a divorce from her cheating husband of ten years also pending, there is nothing keeping her in L.A. any longer. Cut loose from her moorings, Ali is summoned back home to Sedona, Arizona, by the death of a childhood friend. Once there she seeks solace in the comforting rhythms of her parents' diner, the Sugarloaf Caf�, and launches an on-line blog as therapy for others who have been similarly cut loose.</p><p>But when threatening posts begin appearing, Ali finds out that running a blog is far more up-close and personal than sitting behind a news desk.

The police believe the friend committed suicide by driving off a mountain road, but Alison thinks it was murder. Susanna Burney expertly conveys the many emotions of the central characters, particularly Alison's anger as she fights for the truth of her friend's death. Burney also conveys a sense of place; the listener is drawn into the red rock scenery of northern Arizona. Some of the male voices sound adolescent, but that's a minor quibble.

Tape bound his wrists and ankles to plasteel chains.</p><p>He had always known it would end horribly. Only the when, where, how, why, and by whom of it all had eluded him.</p><p>That fog was beginning to lift.</p><p>How had he gotten here, wherever </p><p><em>here</em></p><p>was? As though from a great distance, Sigmund watched himself quest for recent memories. Why was it such a struggle?</p><p>He remembered the pedestrian concourse of an open-air mall, shoppers streaming. They wore every color of the rainbow, clothing and hair and skin, in every conceivable combination and pattern. Overhead, fluffy clouds scudded across a clear blue sky. The sun was warm on his face. Work, for once, had been laid aside. He&#x2019;d been content.</p><p>Happiness is the sworn enemy of vigilance. How could he have been so careless?</p><p>Sigmund forced open his eyes. He was in a nearly featureless room. Its walls, floor, and ceiling were resilient plastic. Light came from one wall. I could be anywhere, Sigmund thought-and then two details grabbed his attention.</p><p>The room wasn&#x2019;t quite a box. The glowing wall had a bit of a curve to it.</p><p>There were recessed handholds in walls, floor, and ceiling.</p><p>Panic struck. He was on a </p><p><em>spaceship</em></p><p>! Was gravity a hair higher than usual? Lower? He couldn&#x2019;t tell.</p><p>Plasteel chains clattered dully as Sigmund sat up. He had watched enough old movies to expect chains to clink. Even as the room spun around him and everything faded to black, he found the energy to feel cheated.</p><p>COLD PLASTIC PRESSED AGAINST Sigmund&#x2019;s cheek. He opened his eyes a crack to see the same spartan room. Cell.</p><p>This time he noticed that one link of his chains had been fused to a handhold in the deck.</p><p>Had he passed out from a panic attack? </p><p><em>Where was he?</em></p><p>Sigmund forced himself to breathe slowly and deeply until the new episode receded. Fear could only muddy his thoughts. More deep breaths.</p><p>He had never before blacked out from panic. He could not believe that </p><p><em>his</em></p><p>blackout stemmed from panic. Yes, his faint had closely followed the thought he might be aboard a spaceship. It </p><p><em>also</em></p><p>had occurred just after he had sat up. Sigmund remembered his thoughts having been fuzzy. They seemed sharper now.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been drugged! Doped up and barely awake, he&#x2019;d sat up too fast. </p><p><em>That</em></p><p>was why he had passed out.</p><p>More cautiously this time, Sigmund got into a sitting position. His head throbbed. He considered the pain dispassionately. Less disabling than the last time, he decided. Perhaps the drugs were wearing off.</p><p>Some odd corner of his mind felt shamed by his panic attacks. Most Earthborn had flatland phobia worse than he, and so what? True, he&#x2019;d been born on Earth, but his parents had been all over Known Space. Somehow they took pleasure in strange scents, unfamiliar night skies, and wrong gravity.</p><p>On principle, Sigmund had been to the moon twice. He had had to know: Could he leave Earth should the need ever arise? The second time, it was to make sure the success of that first trip wasn&#x2019;t a fluke.</p><p>He listened carefully. The soft whir of a ventilation fan. Hints of conversation, unintelligible. His own heartbeat. None of the background powerplant hum that permeated the spaceships he&#x2019;d been on. Gravity felt as normal as his senses could judge.</p><p>Recognizing facts, spotting patterns, drawing inferences... he managed, but slowly, as though his thoughts swam through syrup. Traces of drugs remained in his system. He forced himself to concentrate.</p><p>If this was a ship, it was still on Earth. Someone </p><p><em>meant</em></p><p>to panic him, Sigmund decided. Someone wanted something from him. Until they got it, he&#x2019;d probably remain alive. </p><p><em>They</em></p><p>.</p><p>For as long as Sigmund could remember, there had always been some </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>to worry about.</p><p>But even as Sigmund formed that thought, he knew &#x201c;always&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t quite correct....</p><p>IN THE BEGINNING, </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>were unambiguous enough: the Kzinti.</p><p>The Third Man-Kzin War broke out in 2490, the year Sigmund was born. He was five before he knew what a Kzin was-something like an upright orange cat, taller and much bulkier than a man, with a naked, rat-like tail. By then, the aliens had been defeated. The Kzinti Patriarchy ceded two colony worlds to the humans as reparations. In Sigmund&#x2019;s lifetime, they had attacked human worlds three more times. They&#x2019;d lost those wars, too.</p><p>Fafnir was one of the worlds that changed hands after the third war. His parents had wanderlust and not a trace of flatland phobia. They left him in the care of an aunt, and went to Fafnir in 2500 for an adventure.</p><p>And found one.</p><p>Conflict erupted that year between humans on Fafnir and the Kzinti settlers who had remained behind. His parents vanished, in hostilities that failed to rise to the level of a numeral in the official reckoning of Man- Kzin Wars. It was a mere &#x201c;border incident.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone knew the Kzinti ate their prey.</p><p>So </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>, for a long time, were Kzinti. Sigmund hated the ratcats, and everyone understood. And he hated his parents for abandoning him. The grief counselors told his aunt that that was normal. And he hated his aunt, as much as she reminded him of Mom-or perhaps because she did-for allowing Mom and Dad to leave him with her.</p><p>The same year his parents disappeared, the Puppeteers emerged from beyond the rim of Human Space. A species more unlike the Kzinti could not be imagined. Puppeteers looked like two-headed, three-legged, wingless ostriches. The heads on their sinuous necks reminded him of sock puppets. The brain, Aunt Susan told him, hid under the thick mop of mane between the massive shoulders.</p><p>So </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>came to include these other aliens, these harmless-seeming newcomers, because Sigmund didn&#x2019;t believe in coincidence. And then </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>came to include </p><p><em>all</em></p><p>aliens-because, really, how could anyone truly know otherwise?</p><p>That was when Aunt Susan took him to a psychotherapist. Sigmund remembered the stunned look on her face after his first session. After she spoke alone with the therapist. Sigmund remembered her sobbing all that night in her bedroom.</p><p>He had a sickness, or sicknesses, he couldn&#x2019;t spell, much less understand: a paranoid personality disorder. Monothematic delusion with delusional misidentication syndrome. He didn&#x2019;t know if he believed the supposed silver lining: that it was treatable.</p><p>What Sigmund did believe was the other consolation Dr. Swenson offered Aunt Susan-that paranoia is an affliction of the brightest.</p><p>In time, Sigmund understood. Trauma can cause stress can cause biochemical imbalances can cause mental illness. A day and a night asleep in an autodoc corrected the biochemical imbalance in his brain. But a single chemical tweak wasn&#x2019;t enough: Knowing the world is out to get you is its own stress. Three months of therapy with Dr . Swenson addressed the paranoid behaviors Sigmund had already learned.</p><p>Dr. Swenson was right: Sigmund </p><p><em>was</em></p><p>very smart. Smart enough to figure out what the therapist wanted to hear. Smart enough to learn what thoughts to keep to himself.</p><p>TREMBLING, SIGMUND TRIED AGAIN to shake off the drugs. Reliving old horrors served no useful purpose-especially now. He needed to focus.</p><p>Start with </p><p><em>them</em></p><p>. They weren&#x2019;t Kzinti: The room was too small. Kzinti would have gone crazy. </p><p><em>They</em></p><p>wanted something from him; how he responded might be the only control he had in this situation. Who might </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>be?</p><p>Others might see in him only a middle-aged, midlevel financial analyst. A United Nations bureaucrat. A misanthrope dressed always in black, in a world where everyone else wore vibrant colors.</p><p>Sigmund saw more. All those years ago, Dr. Swenson had been far more correct than he knew. Sigmund was more than bright. He was brilliant- in the mind, where it counted, not in gaudy display.</p><p>Who were </p><p><em>they</em></p><p>? Probably somebody Sigmund was investigating. That narrowed it down. The bribe-taking customs officials at Quito Spaceport? The sysadmin at the UN ID data center who moonlighted in identity laundering?</p><p>Sigmund&#x2019;s gut said otherwise. It was his other ongoing investigation: the Trojan Mafia. The gang, known by its reputed base in the Trojan Asteroids, engaged in every kind of smuggling, from artworks to weapons to experimental medicines. They killed for hire-and, more often, just to keep the authorities at bay. They were into extortion, money laundering... everything. Every other analyst in Investigations refused to touch them.</p><p>Surely that was </p><p><em>who</em></p><p>. </p><p><em>How</em></p><p>was more speculative. A &#x201c;chance&#x201d; encounter in the pedestrian mall near his home, he guessed, by someone with a fast-acting hypo-sedative. He stumbles; his assailant, to all appearances a Good Samaritan, helps him to the nearest transfer booth.</p><p>Where? Other than somewhere on Earth, Sigmund wasn&#x2019;t prepared to guess. On a world bristling with transfer booths, he could have been teleported instantaneously almost anywhere.</p><p>And when? Blinking to de-blur his vision, Sigmund raised his hands. His left wrist hurt-not much, but it hurt. The time display had frozen. Ironic that, since the subcutaneous control pips felt melted: tiny beads beneath his thumb. Clock, weather, compass, calculator, maps, all the utility functions he normally summoned by .fingernail pressure... all gone. He guessed his implant had been fried with a magnetic pulse. It .t the program of disorientation.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t as smart as they thought.

American politics has lost its civic voice, leaving both liberals and conservatives unable to inspire the sense of community and civic engagement that self-government requires. <p></p><p> In search of a public philosophy adequate to our time, Sandel ranges across the American political experience, recalling the arguments of Jefferson and Hamilton, Lincoln and Douglas, Holmes and Brandeis, FDR and Reagan. He relates epic debates over slavery and industrial capitalism to contemporary controversies over the welfare state, religion, abortion, gay rights, and hate speech. <i>Democracy's Discontent</i> provides a new interpretation of the American political and constitutional tradition that offers hope of rejuvenating our civic life. </p></p><p>Michael Sandel has written an important book about the meaning of liberty. Sandel argues that over the last century, Americans have abandoned an earlier communitarian view of liberty, rooted in participation in self-government, for a narrower, individualistic definition, based on the power of personal choice. That has led to the great paradox of American politics: Just as Americans have become freer in the conduct of their personal lives, they have become more constrained in their public lives. The strength of Sandel&#39;s book is his account of how this definition of liberty has changed over the last 200 years. He argues persuasively that the new definition reinforces undesirable trends in court decisions and public policy Sandel argues brilliantly that the change in this definition of liberty took place after the Civil War and was based primarily on economic change. His analysis is superb. By revealing the shallowness of liberal and conservative views of democracy, [this book] inspires us to reevaluate what American politics is really about.Despite the success of American life in the last half-century - unprecedented affluence, greater social justice for women and minorities, the end of the Cold War - our politics is rife with discontent. Americans are frustrated with government. We fear we are losing control of the forces that govern our lives, and that the moral fabric of community - from neighborhood to nation - is unraveling around us. What ails democracy in America today, and what can be done about it? Democracy&#39;s Discontent traces our political predicament to a defect in the public philosophy by which we live. In a searching account of current controversies over the role of government, the scope of rights and entitlements, and the place of morality in politics, Michael Sandel identifies the dominant public philosophy of our time and finds it flawed. The defect, Sandel maintains, lies in the impoverished vision of citizenship and community shared by Democrats and Republicans alike. American politics has lost its civic voice, leaving both liberals and conservatives unable to inspire the sense of community and civic engagement that self-government requires. In search of a public philosophy adequate to our time, Sandel ranges across the American political experience, recalling the arguments of Jefferson and Hamilton, Lincoln and Douglas, Holmes and Brandeis, FDR and Reagan.

He'd grown a beard in the weeks since he'd left the Triple M, at the old man's worried urging, in search of the recalcitrant brother riding beside him now. Far as he was concerned, the old man had nobody but himself to blame for all the problems. He'd been the one to pit his three sons against one another in the first place by issuing a decree that the first to marry and produce a child could get the ranch.<br><br>Now, Kade's hair was shaggy, his scalp itched, and he couldn't remember the last time he'd had a hot bath, a sound night's sleep, or a decent meal. After following a number of false trails, he'd finally tracked Jeb to Tombstone, where the little bastard had been having a high old time, and the whole experience had left Kade with a sour taste in his mouth. Right about then, he'd just as soon knock out a couple of Jeb's perfect teeth as look at him.<br><br>Jeb had come along willingly enough, probably because he'd been up to no good in Tombstone and gotten on the wrong side of some bad people, though if he'd wanted to stay, Kade would have had a fight on his hands. Jeb hadn't offered any insights into what he'd been doing, and Kade, being equally stubborn, hadn't asked for any, though he'd surmised on his own that women were involved. With Jeb, women were <i>always</i> involved.<br><br>The fact was, he was curious about his brother's exploits, but he was in no mood for Jeb's patented smirk and smart-ass rhetoric, so it was better all around to leave well enough alone, for the time being at least. <br><br>Main Street was uncommonly quiet, and the air had a certain weight, as though something were waiting out there, just beyond the edge of town, building up steam. Without exchanging so much as a glance, the brothers reined in at the livery stable, where Old Billy kept his blacksmith shop, saying as few words as possible to each other or the talkative proprietor while they made the arrangements and left their horses to be fed, groomed, and put up for the night. Kade wanted nothing so much as to get back to the Triple M, back to his books and his own bed and Concepcion's fine and consistent cooking, but night was coming on, and the animals were spent from several days of hard riding. The ranch was just two hours away, but it might as well have been twenty, in terms of the effort required to get there.<br><br>Leaving the livery, Kade and Jeb walked side by side down the broad wooden sidewalk, spurs jingling in discordant concert. The emptiness of the street made Kade edgy; he scanned the storefronts and roofs on either side -- looking for what? Strangers? Riflemen? He didn't know, but something.<br><br>A skiff of a snowfall began, riding a stinging wind and putting a seal on his glum mood.<br><br>The Arizona Hotel was just ahead, spilling light from its windows, the new parts of it framed in with lumber but still skeletal, and Kade raised a hand to his beard as they approached, wishing he looked a mite more presentable. There was a good chance that Emmeline, their elder brother Rafe's wife, would be there, since she was part owner, along with her spirited and unconventional mother, and Kade had a tender place for his sister-in-law. Rafe he hoped to avoid, at least for a while. Ever since their father had laid down the law abou the ranch, they'd been at odds.<br><br>Reaching the hotel's front door, Jeb put out one leather-gloved hand and wrenched it open in mocking deference. "After you," he told Kade. The look in his eyes was downright irascible.<br><br>Kade gave his brother a scathing once-over, squared his shoulders, and stepped over the threshold. The lobby was warm and cheerful, with curtains and carpets and china-globed lamps, offering a pleasant contrast to the hardship of the trail, and a blaze was crackling on the hearth of a newly added fieldstone fireplace. Steamy, savory smells wafted from the direction of the dining room, the only restaurant in town. It didn't compare to the ones in lively Tombstone, where there were any number of such establishments, including ice cream parlors, but if there had to be just one eatery in Indian Rock, Kade was grateful it was a good one.<br><br>A small nun with striking blue-green eyes stood behind the registration desk. His brain dulled by fatigue, Kade blinked once, certain he was seeing things, before he remembered meeting the young woman on a couple of other occasions, once at a party a few months back, on the ranch, and on a previous visit to the hotel. She'd come in on the stagecoach one day, by the account he'd heard, and Emmeline and her mother had seen she was down on her luck and offered her work at the hotel. Something about her worried at his memory like the teeth of a dog, but he put it down to being road weary and saddle sore.<br><br>Sister Mandy, she called herself, he recalled that much. He smiled a little and ambled toward her, with Jeb chinking along a few strides behind. Irreverently, he wondered what she's look like in a party dress.<br><br>"Welcome to the Arizona Hotel," she said, watching him in a wary way, as though taking his measure. She looked about half-ready to bolt for the nearest exit. She probably figured him for an outlaw, with his seedy countenance, and that amused him as much as her disguise. Whatever Sister Mandy was, she was no more a nun than he was an outlaw; he would have bet his favorite saddle on that. Or traded it for a real good look at her.<br><br>"Would you gentlemen like a room?" she asked.<br><br>Kade remembered his manners -- he hadn't had much call to use them of late, so he was somewhat out of practice -- and removed his hat. "Two rooms," he said, without looking at Jeb. He'd been bunking on the opposite side of a campfire from that polecat for almost a week as it was, and he needed some elbow room, literally and figuratively. "Please."<br><br>Sister Mandy nodded and swiveled the registration book around for Kade to sign. He picked up the pen, dipped it into an open inkwell, and wrote his name with a flourish. Jeb penned his own signature underneath, barely legible, like always.<br><br>"I'll be wanting a bath," Jeb said. Seemed he hadn't forgotten how to talk after all, damn the luck. <br><br>"You need one," Kade observed, without looking at his brother. He was spoiling to tie into somebody, had been since they'd left Tombstone, but he'd bide his time. Becky had worked hard to make the Arizona Hotel a respectable place, and the last thing she needed -- or would tolerate -- was a brawl in her cheerful lobby. Besides, a lady was present. So to speak.<br><br>"Go to hell," Jeb responded blithely. Out of the corner of his eye, Kade saw his brother flex his left hand and knew he felt the same longing as he did to throw a punch and feel it connect.<br><br>"That's fifty cents extra," Mandy said, raising her voice a little, looking from one of them to another, clearly discomforted. The words they'd exchanged had been mild enough, but the testy undercurrent was unmistakable. Kade felt a moment's shame for alarming the girl, though he wouldn't credit Jeb with the decency to do the same. "With the room, that will be two dollars," she finished.<br><br>Jeb laid the money on the desk and gestured for a key with a beckoning motion of his fingers. Kade was reaching for his own wallet when Emmeline swept in from the dining room, looking flushed and plump and happy, and thereby distracting them all. She and Rafe had gotten off to an uneven start where matrimony was concerned, but if her expression was anything to go by, they'd resolved the worst of their difficulties and reached a comfortable accord of some sort.<br><br>"You're back!" she cried, pleased, approaching Jeb and Kade and rising on tiptoe to favor each of them with a sisterly kiss on the cheek. Kade found himself wishing, yet again, that he'd taken the time for a bath and barbering somewhere along the way. "We've been worried into a regular fret, every one of us. Where have you been all these weeks?"<br><br>Kade and Jeb glanced at each other in a desultory fashion, but when Kade turned back to his fair-haired, bright-eyed sister-in-law, he was wearing a stock smile. She was Rafe's and had been from the first, and he'd best be about accepting the truth of the matter, but facing it sounded a lonesome refrain inside him all the same. "That's too long a story to tell when I'm this hungry," he said. He cocked his head toward the lobby window overlooking the street. "Where is everybody? The place looks like a ghost town."<br><br>Emmeline reached back, fiddling with the ties of her apron. Some of the glow faded from her face and countenance. "Folks are -- nervous. There's been some trouble -- "<br><br>At the edge of his vision, Kade saw Sister Mandy put away his money and Jeb's, and set two brass keys on the desk. Her color seemed a little high. So there was a flesh-and-blood woman under that get-up.<br><br>"What kind of trouble?" Jeb asked, reaching for one of the keys, before Kade could get the words out. Though he'd never said as much, Kade suspected that Jeb, too, had cherished a few sweet illusions where Emmeline was concerned. She'd blown into their family like a fresh breeze on a hot, dry day, arriving from Kansas City as a mail-order bride, and none of them had been the same since. Especially Rafe.<br><br>Emmeline bit her lower lip. "There's talk of some gunplay between the ranches." She inclined her head toward the hotel dining room. "Come along, and I'll get you both a plate of food -- you probably haven't had anything that wasn't cooked over a campfire in days. I'll explain while you eat."<br><br>Jeb and Kade took a table by the window in the next room, and Emmeline brought them coffee first thing, bustling a little, then put in their orders for a pair of fried chicken dinners.<br><br>"Has there been any shooting?" Jeb demanded once Emmeline had served the food and joined them at the table. "Or just talk?" He looked even more amenable to the idea of a good fight than he had out there in the lobby, though now he seemed ready to take on half the territory, not just Kade. Typically, he didn't wait for an answer, but jumped to the first conclusion with a foothold. "It's got to do with Holt Cavanagh buying the Chandler place out from under Pa, hasn't it? He's gone and cut off the water to the Triple M." Cavanagh was more than just an irksome neighbor, he was a half brother to Rafe, Jeb, and Kade -- Angus's son by his first wife, born in Texas and left behind as a babe when Ellie McKettrick had died and the old man had taken it into his head to go north. They hadn't known Holt existed until recently, when he'd hired on at the Triple M pretending to be a regular cowhand, and he was still a burr under their collective hide. Cavanagh's main reason for coming to Indian Rock, it seemed to Kade, was to rankle the McKettricks as much as possible, and while he had his agreeable moments, he was making a good job of it. <br><br>Emmeline hesitated, fidgeted a bit with her hair. A few people were venturing out onto the street by then, even though the snow was coming down faster, whipped into bitter little twisters by the rising wind. Kade was doubly glad to be in out of the weather, though he wished they'd had better news awaiting them. A bare-knuckle row in back of the barn with one or more of his brothers was one thing. A bunch of rowdy cowboys riding all over the countryside gunning for each other was another.<br><br>"It hasn't come down to bullets yet," she said. "Not so far, anyhow. But there's been some nasty talk between the Triple M and the Circle C, and a few other outfits have taken sides. Some fence lines were cut, some cattle rustled, that sort of thing."<br><br>Kade picked up a piece of chicken and bit into it. His stomach was so empty it seemed to be gnawing at his backbone, and he didn't figure he'd be able to think clearly until he'd seen to the matter. "What's Rafe got to say about all this?" he asked, taking advantage of a gap in his chewing and swallowing. Rafe was foreman of the Triple M for the time being, and their pa's mandate notwithstanding, that galled Kade. By his reckoning, Angus McKettrick had been flat wrong to give one of his sons authority over the others, but these days, his opinion didn't appear to account for much.<br><br>Emmeline sighed, fiddling with the checkered gingham curtains at the window. "He's worried," she admitted. "So far, it's just been mischief, mostly, but if there's violence of any kind, there could be a range war."<br><br>History had recorded many a bloody fight between competing ranchers all over the West, and Kade didn't want to see it happen on or around the Triple M. "Has he talked to Cavanagh?" he asked. Holt had a good-sized chunk of land, and the several springs that fed the creek running through the Triple M were squarely within his property. If he wanted to cause real grief for the McKettricks, all he had to do was change the course of the stream or build himself a dam. <br><br>"They've had words," Emmeline admitted. She tried to smile and fell a little short of the mark. "You know how hardheaded Rafe is, and Holt is as bad or worse. All they've done so far is lock horns and exchange accusations. A couple of times, I thought they might actually come to blows." Innocent Emmeline. She'd grown up in the city, in a household of women, even if it was a high-toned brothel, and she knew nothing of the ways of brothers raised to scuffle like bear cubs. Adjusting to life on the Triple M must have been a monumental effort for her, and Kade, for one, admired her grit and gumption.<br><br>"Where's our big brother now?" Jeb wanted to know. He'd evidently eaten as much as he cared to and pushed his plate away to sip the stout coffee. Kade, on the other hand, was seriously thinking about ordering another chicken dinner, since the first one hadn't hit bottom yet. Nothing much interfered with his appetite, including talk of a range war.<br><br>"He's out with a crew of men, mending fence and rounding up strays," she said. The wistful look that rose in her eyes was gone in a flicker. Kade wondered if, for all her apparent well-being, there might be a problem between her and Rafe after all. <br><br>"And you're staying in town?" Kade asked, summoning up a convivial smile. "What about that fine house Rafe built for the two of you over across the creek from us? Is it standing empty these days?"<br><br>Emmeline shook her head, and all of the sudden she looked tired. Kade felt a pang of concern; if Emmeline was in the family way, Rafe was certain to win control of the Triple M for good. Much as Kade would have liked to be an uncle, he wanted to be a father first. A father with a legacy to leave. <br><br>"Becky's been up in Flagstaff with John Lewis for a week," Emmeline said, "so I've been helping Clive and Sister Mandy look after the hotel." Becky Fairmont, also known as Becky Harding, depending on her state of mind and the phase of the moon, was Emmeline's mother, and John Lewis, the town marshal, was her beau. The two of them had churned Indian Rock's version of polite society into a regular dither, carrying on the way they did; the ladies down at the spanking-new church were bound to be spending more time on gossip than prayer and hymn singing. Good thing none of them knew the family secret, that Becky had been a madam back in Kansas City, before turning to innkeeping.<br><br>Jeb let out a long sigh and sat back, folding his arms. He looked as disreputable as Kade felt, being sorely in need of scouring, and he didn't smell much better than a sweat-lathered mule. "I'm heading for the Triple M tomorrow," he told Emmeline. "I'd be glad to borrow a buckboard from Old ...</p><h2>Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book Journal</h2><p>This Mudpuppy hardcover lined journal is based on Greg's diary that started it all, in the bestselling <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> by Jeff Kinney.

Hemmed in by implacable enemies on three sides, and by ocean on the fourth, it seemed that the Christian people had nowhere to turn. Indeed, there were many who feared&#x2014;cast in the Millennium&#x2019;s shadow&#x2014;that they were nearing the time when the Antichrist would appear, drowning the world in blood and heralding its end. <br><br>But the Antichrist did not appear, and Christendom did not collapse. Instead, forged from the convulsions of those terrible times, there emerged a new civilization as the Christian people set to the heroic task of building a Jerusalem on earth themselves. With an epic sweep that transports us from the crucifixion to the First Crusade, and from the glitter of Constantinople to the bleak shores of Canada, Tom Holland&#x2019;s <i>The Forge of Christendom</i> is a brilliant study of a truly fateful revolution: the emergence of Western Europe for the first time as a distinctive and expansionist power.<br><br>It was the age of Otto the Great and William the Conqueror, of Caliphs and Viking sea-kings, of hermits, monks, and serfs. It witnessed the spread of castles, the invention of knighthood, and the founding of a papal monarchy. Above all, it brought people to fear that the end days might be at hand, and yet also&#x2014;with an effort so prodigious that it has the power to move us still&#x2014;to invent themselves anew.<br><br>A momentous achievement: for this was nothing less than the founding of the modern West. It is an epic story that Tom Holland renders with the narrative skill and wide-angled scope of a novelist and the careful scholarship a historian. It will transform its readers&#x2019; conception of the origins of the Modern West.</p></p><p><p>TOM HOLLAND gained the top degree at Cambridge before earning his Ph.D. at Oxford. He is the author of the critically acclaimed works of history <i>Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Empire </i>and <i>Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West</i></p>1<br> The Return of the King<br> The Whore of Babylon<br> "All these will I give you," said Satan, showing Jesus the kingdoms of the world, "if you will fall down and worship me."1 But Jesus, scorning empire, refused the temptation. And Satan, confounded, retired in great confusion; and angels came and ministered to the Son of Man. Or so, at any rate, his followers reported.<br>The kingdoms shown to Jesus already had a single master: Caesar. Monarch of a city which had devoured the whole earth, and trampled it down, and broken it to pieces, "exceedingly terrible,"2 he swayed the fate of millions from his palace upon the hill of the Palatine in Rome. Jesus had been born, and lived, as merely one of his myriad subjects. The rule proclaimed by the "Anointed One," the "Christ," however, was not of this world. Emperors and their legions had no power to seize it. The Kingdom of Heaven was promised instead to the merciful, the meek, the poor. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."3 And Jesus -- even facing death -- practised what he had preached. When guards were sent to arrest him, his chief disciple, Peter, "the rock" upon whom it had been prophesied that the Church itself would be built, sought to defend his master; but Jesus, healing the man wounded in the ensuing scuffle, ordered Peter to put up his weapon. "For all who take the sword," he warned, "will perish by the sword."4 Dragged before a Roman governor, Jesus raised no voice of complaint as he was condemned to death as an enemy of Caesar. Roman soldiers guarded him as he hauled his cross through the streets of Jerusalem and out on to the execution ground, Golgotha, the Place of the Skull. Roman nails were hammered through his hands and feet. The point of a Roman spear was jabbed into his side.<br>In the years and decades that followed, Christ's disciples, insisting to the world that their master had risen from His tomb in defiance of Satan and all the bonds of death, not surprisingly regarded the empire of the Caesars as a monstrosity. Peter, who chose to preach the gospel in the very maw of the beast, named Rome "Babylon";5 and it was there that he, like his master, ultimately suffered death by crucifixion. Other Christians arrested in the capital were dressed in animal skins and torn to pieces by dogs, or else set on fire to serve the imperial gardens as torches. Some sixty years after Christ had departed from the sight of His disciples, a revelation of His return was granted to a disciple named John, a vision of the end of days, in which Rome appeared as a whore "drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs," mounted upon a scarlet beast, and adorned with purple and gold -- "and on her forehead was written a name of mystery: 'Babylon the great, mother of harlots and of earth's abominations.'"6 Great though she was, however, the doom of the whore was certain. Rome would fall, and deadly portents afflict mankind, and Satan, "the dragon, that ancient serpent,"7 escape his prison, until at last, in the final hour of reckoning, Christ would come again, and all the world be judged, and Satan and his followers be condemned to a pit of fire. And an angel, the same one who had shown John the revelation, warned him not to seal up the words of the prophecy vouchsafed to him, "For the hour is near."<br>But the years slipped by, and Christ did not return. Time closed the eyes of the last man to have seen Him alive. His followers, denied a Second Coming, were obliged to adapt to a present still ruled by Caesar. Whore or not, Rome gave to them, as to all her subjects, the fruits of her world-spanning order. Across the empire, communities of Christians spread and flourished. Gradually, step by tentative step, a hierarchy was established capable of administering these infant churches. Just as Jesus had given to Peter the charge to be shepherd of His sheep, so congregations entrusted themselves to "overseers": "bishops." "Pappas," such men were called: affectionate Greek for "father." Immersed as they were in the day-to-day running of their bishoprics, such men could hardly afford to stake all their trust in extravagant visions of apocalypse. Though they remained passionate in their hope of beholding Christ's return in glory, they also had a responsibility to care for their flocks in the present. Quite as much as any pagan, many came to realise, they had good cause to appreciate the pax Romana.<br>Nor was justification for this perspective entirely lacking in Holy Scripture. St. Paul -- although martyred, as St. Peter had been, in Rome -- had advised the Church there, before his execution, that the structures of governance, even those of the very pagan empire itself, had been "instituted by God."8 Indeed, it struck many students of the apostle that the Caesars had a more than incidental role to play in his vision of the end of days. Whereas St. John had portrayed Rome as complicit with the Beast, that demon in human form who was destined, just before Christ's return, to establish a tyranny of universal evil, seducing men and women everywhere by means of spectacular miracles, chilling their souls and dimming the Church beneath a tide of blood, Paul, it seemed, had cast the empire as precisely the opposite: the one bulwark capable of "restraining" Antichrist.9 Yet such an interpretation did not entirely clear up the ambivalence with which most Christians still regarded Rome, and the prospect of her fall: for if the reign of Antichrist was self-evidently to be dreaded, then so also might it be welcomed, as heralding Christ's return. "But of that or that hour," as Jesus Himself had admonished His disciples, "no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."10 That being so, many Church fathers concluded, it could hardly be reckoned a sin to hold Rome's empire in their prayers.<br>For redeemed though they hoped to be, even the devoutest Christians were sinners still, fallen and fashioned out of dust. Until a new heaven and a new earth had been established upon the ruins of the old, and a new Jerusalem descended "out of heaven from God,"11 the Church had no choice but to accommodate itself to the rule of a worldly power. Laws still had to be administered, cities governed, order preserved. Enemies of that order, lurking in dank and distant forests, or amid the sands of pitiless deserts, still had to be kept at bay. As the fourth century of the Christian era dawned, followers of the Prince of Peace were to be found even among the ranks of Caesar's soldiers.12 Later ages would preserve the memory of Maurice, an Egyptian general stationed at the small town of Agaunum, in the Alps, who had commanded a legion entirely comprising of the faithful. Ordered to put to the sword a village of innocent fellow Christians, he had refused. And yet, as Maurice himself had made perfectly clear to the infuriated emperor, he would have found in an order to attack pagan enemies no cause for mutiny. "We are your soldiers, yes," he was said to have explained, "but we are also the soldiers of God. To you, we owe the dues of military service -- but to Him the purity of our souls."13<br>The emperor, however, had remained toweringly unimpressed. He had ordered the mutineers' execution. And so it was that Maurice and the entire legion under his command had won their martyrs' crowns.<br>Ultimately, it seemed, obedience to both Christ and Caesar could not be reconciled.<br>A New Rome<br> But what if Caesar himself were a servant of Christ? Barely a decade after Maurice's martyrdom, and even as persecution of the Church rose to fresh heights of ferocity, the hand of God was preparing to manifest itself in a wholly unexpected way. In ad 312 a pretender to the imperial title by the name of Constantine marched from Gaul -- what is now France -- across the Alps, and on towards Rome. The odds seemed stacked against him. Not only was he heavily outnumbered, but his enemies had already taken possession of the capital. One noon, however, looking to the heavens for inspiration, Constantine saw there the blazing of a cross, visible to his whole army, and inscribed with the words, "By this sign, conquer." That night, in his tent, he was visited by Christ Himself. Again came the instruction: "By this sign, conquer." Constantine, waking at dawn, obeyed. He gave orders for the "heavenly sign of God" to be inscribed upon his soldiers' shields.14 When battle was finally joined outside Rome, Constantine was victorious. Entering the capital, he did not forget to whom he had owed his triumph. Turning his back on a whole millennium of tradition, he offered up no sacrifices to those demons whom the Caesars, in their folly and their blindness, had always worshipped as gods. Instead, the dominion of the Roman people was set upon a radically new path, one which God had clearly long been planning for it, to serve Him as the tool and agent of His grace, as an imperium christianum -- a Christian empire.<br>"And because Constantine made no supplications to evil spirits, but worshipped only the one true God, he enjoyed a life more favoured by marks of worldly prosperity than anyone would have dared imagine was possible."15 Certainly, it was hard for anyone to dispute that his reign had indeed been divinely blessed. In all, Constantine ruled for thirty-one years: only a decade less than the man who had first established his fiat over Rome and her empire, Caesar Augustus. It was during the reign of Augustus that Jesus had been born into the world; and now, under Constantine, so it seemed to his Christian subjects, the times were renewing themselves again. In Jerusalem, earth and rubbish were cleared from the tomb in which Christ had been laid. A Church of the Holy Sepulchre, "surpassing all the churches of the world in beauty," was raised above it, and over Golgotha, the hill of the crucifixion...</p><h2>Rimbaud: Complete Works, Selected Letters</h2><p>Wallace Fowlie's prose translations accompany the original French texts in this, the first complete bilingual edition of Rimbaud's work in prose and poetry.<br><br>"This handsome edition, which makes France's most remarkable poet readily available in the U.S., may well be a literary landmark comparable to Baudelaire's introduction of Edgar Allan Poe in France a century earlier."&#x2014;Anna Balakian, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p></p><h2>Brightness Reef (The Uplift Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p><b>David Brin&#x2019;s Uplift novels&#x2014;<i>Sundiver,</i> Hugo award winner <i>The Uplift War,</i> and Hugo and Nebula winner <i>Startide Rising&#x2014;</i>are among the most thrilling and extraordinary science fiction tales ever written.

Inspired by the books of Maurice Sendak, Brown decided to pursue his ambition of becoming an illustrator. After receiving a B.F.A. in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art, he worked as a TV art director, a professor of mechanical drawing, and a freelance illustrator, before becoming a writer. In his books, he addresses the fears and problems which children face and events like friendship, family, school and pets. For his illustrations, Brown uses pencil with watercolor on a variety of papers to achieve different visual effects. The &#34;Arthur&#34; series, about the everyday adventures of a lovable aardvark, began in 1976 and continues to this day with 25 titles published. Brown has also created other series such as the &#34;Rhymes&#34; series, and the nonfiction &#34;Dinosaur&#34; series, which conveys messages of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. These series, like the stories of Arthur, hold the attention of young children while transporting their imaginations on magical journeys.Aided again by the amiable dinos from Dinosaurs to the Rescue! and Dinosaurs Divorce, the Browns tackle perhaps their toughest subject to date. Using the frank yet reassuring tack employed in the previous books, the author presents a balanced, comprehensive and age-appropriate explanation of why death occurs and other such issues, and suggests sensible, specific tactics for coping with the resulting loneliness, fright and anger. At the same time, she wisely leaves room for a child's individual response, acknowledging that with the death of a loved one, be it a pet or a parent, "there is no right or wrong way to feel." Equally wisely, she defers some explanations to other adults. For example, after an array of dinosaur characters offers different beliefs on what happens after death, she advises readers, "If you have questions about it, ask your family or your religious leader." Marc Brown's typically busy art contains uplifting details and comical asides, yet does not whitewash the subject matter; one particularly wrenching scenario shows a young dino kneeling at her bed, saying, "Please, God, let Daddy be alive again. I want him back." These astute collaborators provide a commendable service for grieving children and the adults in their lives.

She lives in Brooklyn.<b>I</b><br> &nbsp;<br><b> Gordes</b><br> &nbsp;<br> There was, it turned out, no train to the village where the Chagalls lived: one of many complications he&#x2019;d failed to anticipate. He had to pay a boy with a motorbike to run him up from the station at Cavail�lon, ten miles at a brainshaking pace along a narrow rutted road. On either side rose ochre hills striated with grapevines and lavender and olive trees; overhead, a blinding white-veined sky. The smell was of the boy&#x2019;s leather jacket and of charred potatoes, exhalate of his clever homemade fuel. At the foot of the village the boy parked in a shadow, accepted Varian&#x2019;s francs, and tore off into the distance before Varian could arrange a ride back.<br><br> The streets of Gordes, carved into a sunstruck limestone hill above the Luberon Valley, offered little in the way of shade. He would have given anything to be back in Marseille with a glass of Aperol before him, watching sailors and girls, gangsters and spice vendors, parading the Canebi�re. The Chagalls had only agreed to see him on the basis that he not bring up the prospect of their emigration. But what other subject was there? The Nazis had taken Paris months ago, they were burning books in the streets of Alsace, they could send any refugee over the border at will. At least the Chagalls <i>had </i>agreed; that was something. But as he reached the house, an ancient Catholic girls&#x2019; school on the rue de la Fontaine Basse, he found himself fighting the urge to flee. His credentials, if anyone examined them, amounted to a fanatic&#x2019;s knowledge of European history, a desire to get out from behind his desk in New York, and a deep frustration with his isola�tionist nation. And yet this was his job; he&#x2019;d volunteered for it. What was more, he believed he could do it. He raised his hand and knocked.<br><br> An eye appeared in the brass circlet of the peephole, and a girl in a striped apron opened the door. She listened, strangling her index finger with one dark curl, as he stated his name and mission. Then she ushered him down a corridor and out into a courtyard, where a stone path led to a triangle of shade. There, at a bare wooden table, Chagall and his wife sat at lunch: the painter in his smock, his hair swept back from his forehead in silver waves; Bella in a close-fitting black dress too hot for the day.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah, Monsieur Fry,&#x201d; Chagall said, rising to meet him. The painter&#x2019;s eyes were large and uncommonly sharp, his expression one of bemuse�ment. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come after all. I thought you might. You won&#x2019;t forget our agreement, will you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All I want is your company for an hour.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying, of course. But you lie charmingly.&#x201d;<br><br> They sat together at the table, Bella on Varian&#x2019;s left, the painter to his right&#x2014;he, Varian Fry, sitting down with the Chagalls, with <i>Chagall, </i>author of those color-saturated visions, those buoyant bridal couples and intelligent-eyed goats he&#x2019;d seen in hushed rooms at the Museum of Modern Art. Bella filled a plate with brown hard-crusted miche, soft cheese, sardines crackling with salt; she handed it across the table, assessing Varian in silence.<br><br> &#x201c;Had you been here a few days ago, we would have had tomatoes,&#x201d; Chagall said. &#x201c;A farmer brings them up to the market on Thursdays. I&#x2019;m sorry we don&#x2019;t have more to offer. The bread&#x2019;s a little hard on the tooth, I&#x2019;m afraid, but c&#x2019;est la guerre!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This is lavish,&#x201d; Varian said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too kind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not at all. We like to share what we have.&#x201d; He gestured around him at the bare yellow stones, the rough benches, the shock of gold-green hillside visible through an archway in the wall. &#x201c;As you see, we&#x2019;re living a quiet and retired life in our little dacha. No one will bother us here at Gordes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You have a studio,&#x201d; Varian said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re still producing work. That&#x2019;s what makes you dangerous.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Our daughter says the same,&#x201d; Bella said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been saying it for months. But you understand, Monsieur Fry&#x2014;my husband&#x2019;s reputa�tion will protect him. Vichy wouldn&#x2019;t dare touch us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;With respect, Madame Chagall, I don&#x2019;t believe that for a moment. Vichy is subject to the Nazis&#x2019; whims. And we all know what they&#x2019;re capable of. I&#x2019;ve seen it myself. I was in Berlin in &#x2019;35&#x2014;sent by the magazine I worked for. My last night in town there was a riot on the Kurfurstendamm. The things I saw&#x2014;men pulled from their shops and beaten in the streets&#x2014;an old man stabbed through the hand at a caf� table&#x2014;boys dragging a woman by her hair&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;These things happened in Germany,&#x201d; Chagall said, his tone harder now. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t happen here. Not to us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Let me speak to my friend at the consulate,&#x201d; Varian said. &#x201c;Ask him to start a file for you, at least. If you do decide to leave, it might take months.&#x201d;<br><br> Chagall shook his head. &#x201c;My apologies, Monsieur Fry. I&#x2019;m sorry you had to come all this way in vain. But perhaps you&#x2019;d like to have a look at the studio before you go&#x2014;if you&#x2019;ve finished, that is.&#x201d;<br><br> Varian couldn&#x2019;t speak; he could scarcely believe that a person of Chagall&#x2019;s intelligence, a person of his experience, could fail to see what he himself saw clearly. Chagall rose and crossed the courtyard to a set of ten-foot-high blue doors, and Varian got to his feet. He nodded his thanks to Bella, then followed Chagall across the bro�ken paving stones. Beyond the blue doors was a long, high-ceilinged room with a wall of windows: the former refectory of the girls&#x2019; school. Canvases lay about everywhere, and for long minutes Varian walked among them in silence. As well as he knew the painter&#x2019;s work, he had never seen it like this: in its pupal state, damp and mutable, smell�ing of turpentine, raw wood, wet clay. From the canvases rose ghost�like images: a grave-eyed Madonna hovering above a shadowed town, serenaded by cows and angels; crucified Christ wrapped in a prayer shawl, his head encircled by grieving sages; a woman kneeling beside a river, pressing a baby to her chest; clusters of red and white flowers rising like flames.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no small matter to cross an ocean,&#x201d; Chagall said. &#x201c;More can be lost than canvas and paint. An artist must bear witness, Monsieur Fry. He cannot turn away, even if he wishes to.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;An artist can&#x2019;t bear witness if he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br><br> The painter removed his hat and set it on his knee. &#x201c;The Emer�gency Rescue Committee mustn&#x2019;t concern itself further with our wel�fare,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Save your resources for those who truly need help. Max Ernst, for example&#x2014;he&#x2019;s rumored to be in a concentration camp at Gurs. Or Jacques Lipchitz, my friend from Montparnasse. Who knows where he&#x2019;s fled to now? Or Lev Zilberman, who painted those massive murals in Berlin.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I know Zilberman&#x2019;s work. Alfred Barr fought to get him on our list.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not entirely on the wrong path, then. Help Ernst, help Zil�berman. Not me.&#x201d; And he turned away from Varian, toward his can�vases, toward the brushes and knives, the wooden boxes cluttered with crushed tubes of paint. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll mention your name among our circles,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know plenty who are eager to leave.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> _____<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Varian stumbled along the road toward Cavaillon, down the hill he&#x2019;d seen through the courtyard arch. It would take him two hours to reach the station at this rate; another two on the train after that, and then he&#x2019;d be back in Marseille, having made no progress at all. And what would he report to his colleagues in New York&#x2014;to Paul Hagen, who directed the Emergency Rescue Committee, or to Frank Kingdon, its chair? That summer, when he and Paul and Ingrid Warburg and Alfred Barr and the others had compiled their list&#x2014;two hundred art�ists, writers, and intellectuals who&#x2019;d been blacklisted by the Gestapo and had no way out of France&#x2014;they hadn&#x2019;t imagined that their clients might resist being helped, nor that they&#x2019;d consider themselves beyond Vichy&#x2019;s reach. There were so many things they hadn&#x2019;t considered; his life in France had become a process of discovering them, often to his embarrassment. It was a miracle he&#x2019;d managed to get anyone out at all. There had been only twelve so far, a minuscule fraction of his list.<br><br> What he ought to do, he thought as he kicked stones along the rutted road, was to write his wife that night to say he was coming home. He&#x2019;d confess&#x2014;and what a relief it would be&#x2014;that his work wasn&#x2019;t going as planned. How had he imagined it would take a month, <i>one month, </i>to find and extract two hundred endangered artists? He&#x2019;d envisioned himself riding a rented bicycle through the countryside, rounding up refugees by the dozen, as if they&#x2019;d be waiting in the lemon orchards with traveling papers in hand. He&#x2019;d imagined that the consulate would contort itself miraculously to help him. But then the chaos of this place, the innumerable bureaucratic barriers, the cre�tins in the U.S. Visa Office, the resistance of the artists themselves. What a mistake he&#x2019;d made, crawling out from behind his desk at the publishing house. How could he have presumed to take the lives of men like Chagall and Ernst into his hands when he had no idea how to manage them&#x2014;no idea, even, of how to convince them they were in danger? Eileen wanted him home; she feared for his life. Her letter from last week had made that clear. Well, home he&#x2019;d go. He&#x2019;d write her at once; he&#x2019;d write her as soon as he reached the Splendide.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Paradise War: Book One in The Song of Albion Trilogy (Song of Albion)</h2><p><p>From the dreaming spires of Oxford, Lewis Gillies drives north to seek a mythical creature in a misty glen in Scotland.

Deo was a young medical student who fled the genocidal civil war in Burundi in 1994 for the uncertainty of New York City. Against absurd odds--he arrived with little money and less English and slept in Central Park while delivering groceries for starvation wages--his own ambition and a few kind New Yorkers led him to Columbia University and, beyond that, to medical school and American citizenship. That his rise followed a familiar immigrant's path to success doesn't make it any less remarkable, but what gives Deo's story its particular power is that becoming an American citizen did not erase his connection to Burundi, in either his memory or his dreams for the future. Writing with the same modest but dogged empathy that made his recent <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i> (about Deo's colleague and mentor, Dr. Paul Farmer) a modern classic, Tracy Kidder follows Deo back to Burundi, where he recalls the horrors of his narrow escape from the war and begins to build a medical clinic where none had been before. Deo's terrible journey makes his story a hard one to tell; his tirelessly hopeful but clear-eyed efforts make it a gripping and inspiring one to read. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Tracy Kidder on <i>Strength in What Remains </i></strong><br><br> <i>Strength in What Remains</i> is the story of Deogratias, a young man from the central African nation of Burundi.

When I first heard his story, I had one simple thought: I would not have survived. I hoped in part to reproduce that feeling as I retold his story. I also hoped to humanize what, to most westerners anyway, is a mysterious, little-known part of the world. We hear about mass slaughter in distant countries and we imagine that murder and mayhem define those locales. Deo&#x2019;s story opens up one of those places into a comprehensible landscape&#x2014;and also opens up a part of New York that is designed to be invisible, the service entrances of the upper East Side, the camping sites that homeless people use in Central Park. But above all, I think, this is a book about coming to terms with memories. How can a person deal with memories like Deo&#x2019;s, tormenting memories, memories with a distinctly ungovernable quality?</p> <p>In the first part of <i>Strength In What Remains</i>, I recount Deo&#x2019;s story. In the second part, I tell about going back with him to the stations of his life, in New York and Burundi. So the story that I tell isn&#x2019;t only about the memories that Deo related to me. It&#x2019;s also about seeing him overtaken by memories&#x2014;again and again, and sometimes acutely. But Deo didn&#x2019;t take me to Burundi just to show me around. Giving me a tour of his past was incidental to what he was up to in the present and the future. His story has a denoument that even now amazes me. </p> <p>Deo is an American citizen. He doesn&#x2019;t have to go back to Burundi. But he has returned continually and keeps on returning, and, amid the postwar wreckage, with the help of friends and family, he has created a clinic and public health system, free to those who can&#x2019;t pay, in a rural village&#x2014;part of a beginning, Deo dreams, of a new Burundi.</p> <p>This facility was a pile of rocks when I visited the site in the summer of 2006. By the fall of 2008, it had become a medical center with several new buildings, a trained professional staff, and a fully stocked pharmacy. In its first year of operation it treated 21,000 different patients. (The organization that Deo founded and that sponsors and operates this facility is called Village Health Works.) </p> <p>Deo was very young when he went through his long travail. Several strangers helped to save him from death and despair in Burundi and New York. So did sheer courage and pluck, and also Columbia University, which he attended as an undergraduate. But when it&#x2019;s come to dealing with the burden of his memories, the public health system and clinic that he founded has been the nearest thing to a solution. In the end, it&#x2019;s neither forgetting the past nor dwelling on the past that has worked for him. For him the answer has been remembering and acting. I once asked Deo why he had studied philosophy at Columbia. He told me, "I wanted to understand what had happened to me." In the end, he received what most students of philosophy receive&#x2014;not answers, but more questions. As I was trying to describe his effort to build a clinic, I found myself writing: "Deo had discovered a way to quiet the questions he&#x2019;d been asking at Columbia. That is, he saw there might be an answer for what troubled him most about the world, an answer that lay in his hands, indeed in his memory. You had to do something."<i>&#x2014;Tracy Kidder</i></p> <p>(Photo � Gabriel Amadeus Cooney) </p>Tracy Kidder graduated from Harvard and studied at the University of Iowa.

You are likely not a giraffe, toad, or woodpecker. Nor are you a ruminant, those taciturn creatures that graze on grass.<br><br>Ruminants, such as goats and cows, and their ancient, wild counterparts, ibex and aurochs, enjoy evolutionary adaptations that allow them to consume grasses. They have continuously growing teeth to compensate for the wear generated by coarse, sandlike phytolith particles in grass blades; produce in excess of 100 quarts of saliva per day; have four-compartment stomachs that host unique microorganisms to digest grass components, including a compartment that grinds and then regurgitates its contents up as a cud to rechew; and a long, spiral colon that's also host to microorganisms that further digest grassy remains. In other words, ruminants have a gastrointestinal system uniquely specialized to consume grasses.<br><br>You don't look, smell, or act like a ruminant. Then why would you eat like one?<br><br>Those of you who have already forgone wheat do not, of course. But if you remain of the "healthy whole grain"-consuming persuasion, you have fallen victim to believing that grasses should be your primary source of calories. Just as Kentucky bluegrass and ryegrass in your backyard are grasses from the biological family Poaceae, so are wheat, rye, barley, corn, rice, bulgur, sorghum, triticale, millet, teff, and oats. You grow teeth twice in your life, then stop, leaving you to make do for a lifetime with a prepubertal set that erupted around age 10; produce a meager quart of saliva per day; have three fewer stomach compartments unpopulated by foreign organisms and without grinding action; don't chew a cud; and have a relatively uninteresting, linear, nonspiral colon. These adaptations allow you to be omnivorous--but not to consume grasses.<br><br>Early members of our species found nourishment through scavenging, and then hunting, animals such as gazelles, turtles, birds, and fish, and consuming the edible parts of plants, including fruit and roots, as well as mushrooms, nuts, and seeds. Hungry humans instinctively regarded all of these as food. About 10,000 years ago, during a period of increasing temperature and dryness in the Fertile Crescent, humans observed the ibex and aurochs grazing on einkorn, the ancient predecessor of modern wheat. Our hungry, omnivorous ancestors asked, "Can we eat that, too?" They did, and surely got sick: vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea. At the very least they simply passed wheat plants out undigested, since humans lack the ruminant digestive apparatus. Grass plants in their intact form are unquestionably unappetizing. We somehow figured out that for humans, the only edible part of the einkorn plant was the seed--not the roots, not the stem, not the leaves, not the entire seed head--just the seed, and even that was only edible after the outer husk was removed and the seed was chewed or crushed with rocks and then heated in crude pottery over fire. Only then could we consume the seeds of this grass as porridge, a practice that served us well in times of desperation when ibex meat, bird eggs, and figs were in short supply.<br><br>Similar grass-consuming adventures occurred with teosinte and maize (the ancestors of modern corn) in the Americas; rice from the swamps of Asia; and sorghum and millet in sub-Saharan Africa, all requiring similar manipulations to allow the edible part--the seed--to be consumed by humans. Some grasses, such as sorghum, posed other obstacles; its content of poisons (such as hydrocyanic acid, or cyanide) results in sudden death when the plant is consumed before maturity. Natural evolution of grasses led to wheat strains such as emmer, spelt, and kamut as wheat exchanged genes from other wild grasses, while humans selected strains of corn with larger seeds and seed heads (cobs).<br><br>What happened to those first humans, hungry and desperate, who figured out how to make this one component of grasses--the seed--edible? Incredibly, anthropologists have known this for years. The first humans to consume the grassy food of the ibex and aurochs experienced explosive tooth decay; shrinkage of the maxillary bone and mandible, resulting in tooth crowding; iron deficiency; and scurvy. They also experienced a reduction in bone diameter and length, resulting in a loss of as much as 5 inches in height for men and 3 inches for women.1<br><br>The deterioration of dental health is especially interesting, as dental decay was uncommon prior to the consumption of the seeds of grasses, affecting less than 1 percent of all teeth recovered, despite the lack of toothbrushes, toothpaste, fluoridated water, dental floss, and dentists. Even though they lacked any notion of dental hygiene (aside from possibly using a twig to pick the fibers of wild boar from between their teeth), dental decay was simply not a problem that beset many members of our species prior to the consumption of grains. The notion of toothless savages is all wrong; they enjoyed sturdy, intact teeth for their entire lives. It was only after humans began to resort to the seeds of grasses for calories that mouths of rotten and crooked teeth began to appear in children and adults. From that point on, decay was evident in 16 to 49 percent of all teeth recovered, along with tooth loss and abscesses, making tooth decay as commonplace as bad hair among humans of the agricultural Neolithic Age.2<br><br>In short, when we started consuming the seeds of grasses 10,000 years ago, this food source may have allowed us to survive another day, week, or month during times when foods we had instinctively consumed during the preceding 2.5 million years fell into short supply. But this expedient represents a dietary pattern that constitutes only 0.4 percent--less than one-half of 1 percent--of our time on earth. This change in dietary fortunes was accompanied by a substantial price. From the standpoint of oral health, humans remained in the Dental Dark Ages from their first taste of porridge all the way up until recent times. History is rich with descriptions of toothaches, oral abscesses, and stumbling and painful efforts to extract tainted teeth. Remember George Washington and his mouthful of wooden false teeth? It wasn't until the 20th century that modern dental hygiene was born and we finally managed to keep most of our teeth through adulthood.<br><br>Fast-forward to the 21st century: Modern wheat now accounts for 20 percent of all calories consumed by humans; the seeds of wheat, corn, and rice combined make up 50 percent.3 Yes, the seeds of grasses provide half of all human calories. We have become a grass seed-consuming species, a development enthusiastically applauded by agencies such as the USDA, which advises us that increasing our consumption to 60 percent of calories or higher is a laudable dietary goal. It's also a situation celebrated by all of those people who trade grain on an international scale, since the seeds of grasses have a prolonged shelf life (months to years) that allows transoceanic shipment, they're easy to store, they don't require refrigeration, and they're in demand worldwide--all the traits desirable in a commoditized version of food. The transformation of foodstuff into that of a commodity that's tradeable on a global scale allows financial manipulations, such as buying and selling futures, hedges, and complex derivative instruments--the tools of mega-commerce--to emerge. You can't do that with organic blueberries or Atlantic salmon.<br><br>Examine the anatomy of a member of the species Homo sapiens and you cannot escape the conclusion that you are not a ruminant, have none of the adaptive digestive traits of such creatures, and can only consume the seeds of grasses--the food of desperation--by accepting a decline in your health. But the seeds of grasses can be used to feed the masses cheaply, quickly, and on a massive scale, all while generating huge profits for those who control the flow of these commoditized foods.<br><br>MUTANT NINJA GRASSES<br><br>The seeds of grasses, known to us more familiarly as "grains" or "cereals," have always been a problem for us nonruminant creatures. But then busy geneticists and agribusiness got into the act. That's when grains went from bad to worse.<br><br>Readers of the original <i>Wheat Belly</i> know that modern wheat is no longer the 4 1/2-foot-tall traditional plant we all remember; it is now an 18-inch-tall plant with a short, thick stalk; long seed head; and larger seeds. It has a much greater yield per acre than its traditional predecessors. This high- yield strain of wheat, now the darling of agribusiness, was not created through genetic modification, but through repetitive hybridizations, mating wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce new genes (wheat is a grass, after all) and through mutagenesis, the use of high-dose x-rays, gamma rays, and chemicals to induce mutations. Yes: Modern wheat is, to a considerable degree, a grass that contains an array of mutations, some of which have been mapped and identified, many of which have not. Such uncertainties never faze agribusiness, however. Unique mutated proteins? No problem. The USDA and FDA say they're okay, too--perfectly fine for public consumption.<br><br>Over the years, there have been many efforts to genetically modify wheat, such as by using gene-splicing technology to insert or delete a gene. However, public resistance has dampened efforts to bring genetically modified (GM) wheat to market, so no wheat currently sold is, in the terminology of genetics, "genetically modified." (There have been recent industry rumblings, however, that make the prospect of true GM wheat a probable reality in the near future.) All of the changes introduced into modern wheat are the results of methods that predate the technology to create GM foods. This does not mean that the methods used to change wheat were benign; in fact, the crude and imprecise methods used to change wheat, such as chemical mutagenesis, have the potential to be worse than genetic modification, yielding a greater number of unanticipated changes in genetic code than the handful introduced through gene-splicing.4<br><br>Corn and rice, on the other hand, have been genetically modified, in addition to undergoing other changes. For instance, scientists introduced genes to make corn resistant to the herbicide glyphosate and to express Bacillus thurigiensis (Bt), a toxin that kills insects, while rice has been genetically modified to make it resistant to the herbicide glufosinate and to express beta-carotene (a variety called Golden Rice). Problem: While, in theory, the notion of just inserting one silly gene seems simple and straightforward, it is anything but. The methods of gene insertion remain crude. The site of insertion--which chromosome, within or alongside other genes, within or without various control elements--not to mention disruption of epigenetic effects that control gene expression, cannot be controlled with current technology. And it's misleading to say that only one gene is inserted, as the methods used usually require several genes to be inserted. (We discuss the nature of specific changes in GM grains in Chapter 2.)<br><br>The wheat, corn, and rice that make up 50 percent of the human diet in the 21st century are not the wheat, corn, and rice of the 20th century. They're not the wheat, corn, and rice of the Middle Ages, nor of the Bible, nor of the Egyptian empire. And they are definitely not the same wheat, corn, and rice that was harvested by those early hungry humans. They are what I call "Frankengrains": hybridized, mutated, genetically modified to suit the desires of agribusiness, and now available at a supermarket, convenience store, or school near you.<br><br>Wheat: What Changed . . . and Why Are the Changes So Bad?<br><br>All strains of wheat, including traditional strains like spelt and emmer, are problems for nonruminant humans who consume them. But modern wheat is the worst.<br><br>Modern wheat looks different: shorter, thicker shaft, larger seeds. The reduction in height is due to mutations in Rh (reduced height) genes that code for the protein gibberellin, which controls stalk length. This one mutant gene is accompanied by other mutations. Changes in Rh genes are thereby accompanied by other changes in the genetic code of the wheat plant.5 There's more here than meets the eye.<br><br>Gliadin<br><br>While gluten is often fingered as the source of wheat's problems, it's really gliadin, a protein within gluten, that is the culprit behind many destructive health effects of modern wheat. There are more than 200 forms of gliadin proteins, all incompletely digestible.6 One important change that has emerged over the past 50 years, for example, is increased expression of a gene called Glia-&#x3b1;9, which yields a gliadin protein that is the most potent trigger for celiac disease. While the Glia-&#x3b1;9 gene was absent from most strains of wheat from the early 20th century, it is now present in nearly all modern varieties,7 likely accounting for the 400 percent increase in celiac disease witnessed since 1948.8<br><br>New gliadin variants are partially digested into small peptides that enter the bloodstream and then bind to opiate receptors in the human brain--the same receptors activated by heroin and morphine.9 Researchers call these peptides "exorphins," or exogenous morphine-like com�ds. Gliadin-derived peptides, however, generate no "high," but they do trigger increased appetite and increased calorie consumption, with studies demonstrating consistent increases of 400 calories per day, mostly from carbohydrates.<br><br>Gluten<br><br>Gluten (gliadin + glutenins) is the stuff that confers the stretchiness unique to wheat dough. Gluten is a popular additive in processed foods such as sauces, instant soups, and frozen foods, which means the average person ingests between 15 and 20 grams (g) per day.10 Gluten has been genetically manipulated to improve the baking characteristics of its glutenin. Geneticists have therefore crossbred wheat strains repeatedly, bred wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce new genes, and used chemicals and radiation to induce mutations. Breeding methods used to alter gluten quality do not result in predictable changes. Hybridizing two different wheat plants yields as many as 14 unique glutenin proteins never before encountered by humans.11<br><br>Wheat Germ Agglutinin<br><br>The genetic changes inflicted on wheat have altered the structure of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a protein in wheat that provides protection against molds and insects. The structure of WGA in modern wheat, for instance, differs from that of ancient wheat strains.12 WGA is indigestible and toxic, resistant to any breakdown in the human body, and unchanged by cooking, baking, and sourdough fermentation. Unlike gluten and gliadin, which require genetic susceptibility to exert some of their negative effects, WGA does its damage directly. WGA alone is sufficient to generate celiac disease-like intestinal damage by disrupting microvilli, the absorptive "hairs" of intestinal cells.13</p><h2>American Family Style: Decorating, Cooking, Gardening, Entertaining</h2><p>In more than 500 full-color photographs, Carter offers a treasure trove of ideas for every home, in every region of the country, in every season of the year, and for every holiday.

The second time our house was robbed, it was my brother Nnamabia who faked a break-in and stole my mother&#x2019;s jewelry. It happened on a Sunday. My parents had traveled to our hometown, Mbaise, to visit our grandparents, so Nnamabia and I went to church alone. He drove my mother&#x2019;s green Peugeot 504. We sat together in church as we usually did, but we did not nudge each other and stifle giggles about somebody&#x2019;s ugly hat or threadbare caftan, because Nnamabia left without a word after about ten minutes. He came back just before the priest said, &#x201c;The Mass is ended. Go in peace.&#x201d; I was a little piqued. I imagined he had gone off to smoke and to see some girl, since he had the car to himself for once, but he could at least have told me where he was going. We drove home in silence and, when he parked in our long driveway, I stopped to pluck some ixora flowers while Nnamabia unlocked the front door. I went inside to find him standing still in the middle of the parlor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been robbed!&#x201d; he said in English.<br><br>It took me a moment to understand, to take in the scattered room. Even then, I felt that there was a theatrical quality to the way the drawers were flung open, as if it had been done by somebody who wanted to make an impression on the discoverers. Or perhaps it was simply that I knew my brother so well. Later, when my parents came home and neighbors began to troop in to say <i>ndo, </i>and to snap their fingers and heave their shoulders up and down, I sat alone in my room upstairs and realized what the queasiness in my gut was: Nnamabia had done it, I knew. My father knew, too. He pointed out that the window louvers had been slipped out from the inside, rather than outside (Nnamabia was really much smarter than that; perhaps he had been in a hurry to get back to church before Mass ended), and that the robber knew exactly where my mother&#x2019;s jewelry was &#x2014; the left corner of her metal trunk. Nnamabia stared at my father with dramatic, wounded eyes and said, &#x201c;I know I have caused you both terrible pain in the past, but I would never violate your trust like this.&#x201d; He spoke English, using unnecessary words like &#x201c;terrible pain&#x201d; and &#x201c;violate,&#x201d; as he always did when he was defending himself. Then he walked out through the back door and did not come home that night. Or the next night. Or the night after. He came home two weeks later, gaunt, smelling of beer, crying, saying he was sorry and he had pawned the jewelry to the Hausa traders in Enugu and all the money was gone.<br><br>&#x201c;How much did they give you for my gold?&#x201d; my mother asked him. And when he told her, she placed both hands on her head and cried, &#x201c;Oh! Oh! <i>Chi m egbuo m! </i>My God has killed me!&#x201d; It was as if she felt that the least he could have done was get a good price. I wanted to slap her. My father asked Nnamabia to write a report: how he had sold the jewelry, what he had spent the money on, with whom he had spent it. I didn&#x2019;t think Nnamabia would tell the truth, and I don&#x2019;t think my father thought he would, either, but he liked reports, my professor father, he liked things written down and nicely documented. Besides, Nnamabia was seventeen, with a carefully tended beard. He was in that space between secondary school and university and was too old for caning. What else could my father have done? After Nnamabia wrote the report, my father filed it in the steel drawer in his study where he kept our school papers.<br><br>&#x201c;That he could hurt his mother like this&#x201d; was the last thing my father said, in a mutter.<br><br>But Nnamabia really hadn&#x2019;t set out to hurt her. He did it because my mother&#x2019;s jewelry was the only thing of any value in the house: a lifetime&#x2019;s collection of solid gold pieces. He did it, too, because other sons of professors were doing it. This was the season of thefts on our serene Nsukka campus. Boys who had grown up watching <i>Sesame Street, </i>reading Enid Blyton, eating cornflakes for breakfast, attending the university staff primary school in smartly polished brown sandals, were now cutting through the mosquito netting of their neighbors&#x2019; windows, sliding out glass louvers, and climbing in to steal TVs and VCRs. We knew the thieves. Nsukka campus was such a small place &#x2014; the houses sitting side by side on tree-lined streets, separated only by low hedges &#x2014; that we could not but know who was stealing. Still, when their professor parents saw one another at the staff club or at church or at a faculty meeting, they continued to moan about riffraff from town coming onto their sacred campus to steal.<br><br>The thieving boys were the popular ones. They drove their parents&#x2019; cars in the evening, their seats pushed back and their arms stretched out to reach the steering wheel. Osita, the neighbor who had stolen our TV only weeks before the Nnamabia incident, was lithe and handsome in a brooding sort of way and walked with the grace of a cat. His shirts were always sharply ironed; I used to look across the hedge and see him and close my eyes and imagine that he was walking toward me, coming to claim me as his. He never noticed me. When he stole from us, my parents did not go over to Professor Ebube&#x2019;s house to ask him to ask his son to bring back our things. They said publicly that it was riffraff from town. But they knew it was Osita. Osita was two years older than Nnamabia; most of the thieving boys were a little older than Nnamabia, and perhaps that was why Nnamabia did not steal from another person&#x2019;s house. Perhaps he did not feel old enough, qualified enough, for anything bigger than my mother&#x2019;s jewelry.<br><br>Nnamabia looked just like my mother, with that honey-fair complexion, large eyes, and a generous mouth that curved perfectly. When my mother took us to the market, traders would call out, &#x201c;Hey! Madam, why did you waste your fair skin on a boy and leave the girl so dark? What is a boy doing with all this beauty?&#x201d; And my mother would chuckle, as though she took a mischievous and joyful responsibility for Nnamabia&#x2019;s good looks. When, at eleven, Nnamabia broke the window of his classroom with a stone, my mother gave him the money to replace it and did not tell my father. When he lost some library books in class two, she told his form-mistress that our houseboy had stolen them. When, in class three, he left early every day to attend catechism and it turned out he never once went and so could not receive Holy Communion, she told the other parents that he had malaria on the examination day. When he took the key of my father&#x2019;s car and pressed it into a piece of soap that my father found before Nnamabia could take it to a locksmith, she made vague sounds about how he was just experimenting and it didn&#x2019;t mean a thing. When he stole the exam questions from the study and sold them to my father&#x2019;s students, she shouted at him but then told my father that Nnamabia was sixteen, after all, and really should be given more pocket money.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know whether Nnamabia felt remorse for stealing her jewelry. I could not always tell from my brother&#x2019;s gracious, smiling face what it was he really felt. And we did not talk about it. Even though my mother&#x2019;s sisters sent her their gold earrings, even though she bought an earring-and-pendant set from Mrs. Mozie, the glamorous woman who imported gold from Italy, and began to drive to Mrs. Mozie&#x2019;s house once a month to pay for it in installments, we never talked, after that day, about Nnamabia&#x2019;s stealing her jewelry. It was as if pretending that Nnamabia had not done the things he had done would give him the opportunity to start afresh. The robbery might never have been mentioned again if Nnamabia had not been arrested three years later, in his third year in the university, and locked up at the police station.<br><br>It was the season of cults on our serene Nsukka campus. It was the time when signboards all over the university read, in bold letters, <b>Say No to Cults</b>. The Black Axe, the Buccaneers, and the Pirates were the best known. They may once have been benign fraternities, but they had evolved and were now called &#x201c;cults&#x201d;; eighteen-year-olds who had mastered the swagger of American rap videos were undergoing secret and strange initiations that sometimes left one or two of them dead on Odim Hill. Guns and tortured loyalties and axes had become common. Cult wars had become common: a boy would leer at a girl who turned out to be the girlfriend of the Capone of the Black Axe, and that boy, as he walked to a kiosk to buy a cigarette later, would be stabbed in the thigh, and he would turn out to be a member of the Buccaneers, and so his fellow Buccaneers would go to a beer parlor and shoot the nearest Black Axe boy in the shoulder, and then the next day a Buccaneer member would be shot dead in the refectory, his body falling against aluminum bowls of soup, and that evening a Black Axe boy would be hacked to death in his room in a lecturer&#x2019;s Boys&#x2019; Quarters, his CD player splattered with blood. It was senseless. It was so abnormal that it quickly became normal. Girls stayed inside their hostel rooms after lectures and lecturers quivered and when a fly buzzed too loudly, people were afraid. So the police were called in. They sped across campus in their rickety blue Peugeot 505, rusty guns poking out of the car windows, and glowered at the students. Nnamabia came home from his lectures laughing. He thought the police would have to do better; everyone knew the cult boys had more modern guns.<br><br>My parents watched Nnamabia&#x2019;s laughing face with silent concern and I knew that they, too, were wondering whether he was in a cult. Sometimes I thought he was. Cult boys were popular and Nnamabia was very popular. Boys yelled out his nickname &#x2014; &#x201c;The Funk!&#x201d; &#x2014; and shook his hand whenever he passed by, and girls, especially the popular Big Chicks, hugged him for too long when they said hello. He went to all the parties, the tame ones on campus and the wilder ones in town, and he was the kind of ladies&#x2019; man who was also a guy&#x2019;s guy, the kind who smoked a pack of Rothmans a day and was reputed to be able to finish a carton of Star beer in a sitting. Other times I thought he was not in a cult, because he <i>was </i>so popular and it seemed more his style that he would befriend all the different cult boys and be the enemy of none. And I was not entirely sure, either, that my brother had whatever it took &#x2014; guts or insecurity &#x2014; to join a cult. The only time I asked him if he was in a cult, he looked at me with surprise, his eyelashes long and thick, as if I should have known better than to ask, before he said, &#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d; I believed him. My father believed him, too. But our believing him made little difference, because he had already been arrested and accused of belonging to a cult. He told me this &#x2014; &#x201c;Of course not&#x201d; &#x2014; on our first visit to the police station where he was locked up.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Frida Kahlo: 1907-1954 Pain and Passion</h2><p>The Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) is one of the most important 20th century painters, and one of the few Latin American artists to have achieved a global reputation. In 1983 her work was declared the property of the Mexican state. Kahlo was one of the daughters of an immigrant German photographer and a Mexican woman of Indian origin. Her life and work were more inextricably interwoven than in almost any other artist&#39;s case. Two events in her life were of crucial importance. When she was 18, a bus accident put her in hospital for a year with a smashed spinal column and fractured pelvis. It was from her sick bed that she first started to paint. Then, aged 21, she married the world-famous Mexican mural artist Diego Rivera. She was to suffer the effects of the accident her whole life long, and was particularly pained by her inability to have children. Her arresting pictures, most of them small format self-portraits, express the burdens that weighed upon her soul: her unbearable physical pain, the grief that Rivera&#39;s occasional affairs prompted, the sorrow about her childlessness caused her, her homesickness when living abroad and her longing to feel that she had put down roots, profound loneliness. However, they also declare her passionate love for her husband, her pronounced sensuousness, and her unwavering survival instinct.</p><p>Andrea Kettenmann (born in 1959) studied art history in Gie�en, G�ttingen and Heidelberg before joining the art history department of the University of Hamburg. In 1986 she visited Mexico on a fellowship, and now lives there, working as a freelance art historian. She has now worked on a number of exhibitions and catalogues, including the catalogue for the retrospective on Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo&#x2019;s husband, in Detroit.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</h2><p>Chronicles the off-beat and occasionally extraterrestrial journeys, notions, and acquaintances of galactic traveler Arthur Dent</p><p>Join Douglas Adams's hapless hero Arthur Dent as he travels the galaxy with his intrepid pal Ford Prefect, getting into horrible messes and generally wreaking hilarious havoc.

Imprisoned for the bizarre murder of her lover, Eva Median Canada weaves together memory and fantasy to reveal a life tormented by the brutality of sexual abuse and emotional silence. Brilliantly experimenting with language, Jones infuses her graphic and powerful narrative of the triple yoke of race, class, and gender with a rich musical and oral idiom.Gayl Jones was born in Kentucky in 1949.

( Author ) ON May-02-1991, Paperback - Shirer, William L. - Cornerstone</p><p>William L. Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH is a monumental study of the 20th Century's most frightening moments. Now, 53 years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that our most valued institutions, and way of life, were threatened by the menace that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course Europe was to take is unforgettable.<br><br>Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of documents from the German Foreign Office, captured by the First Army, as well as countless other diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and executed his 6 year quest to dominate the world, only at the end, to see Germany go down in flames.<br><br>The combination of personal recollection and amassing of historical evidence distinguishes this book as one of the great historical works of any time. For instance, he recounts that, from his apartment in Plosslgasse, in Vienna, he personally witnessed how perhaps half of Vienna's 180,000 Jews bargained their way to freedom in 1938.<br><br>Shirer explains that Hitler believed that France and England were too weak to pose much of a threat to his ambitions to subjugate Czechoslovakia, and later Poland. The momentary relief of Russia as a threat to his domination of Europe as a result of the flurry of diplomatic activity that proceeded his invasion of Poland is fascinating. There is no relief, throughout his narrative, of the brutality of Hitler and such a large contingent of Germans who populate this narrative.<br><br>Although 1600 pages long, this is such a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips with the mysterious question as to how this menace to civilization ever came into being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.<br><br>For another book that deals with this problem, why so much of Germany lent its support to Hitler, I heartily recommend HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONER'S, by Daniel Goldhagen, published by Vintage Books. Although filled with perhaps more statistical details then the non-professional historian would need, this book helps to adumbrate the themes in Shirer's great book.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group<b>Ron Rosenbaum </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Explaining Hitler </i>and <i>The Shakespeare Wars </i>and has written or edited six<i> </i>other books.

Such change will not come from governments or corporations but from the ageless process of thinking together in conversation. Turning to One Another encourages this process. Part One explores the power of conversation and the conditions -- simplicity, personal courage, real listening, and diversity -- that support it. Part Two provides ten &#34;&#34;conversation starters&#34;&#34; -- questions that in Wheatley&#39;s experience have led people to share their deepest beliefs, fears, and hopes.</p><p>It is impossible to read <i>Turning to One Another</i> in the wake of the devastating attack on New York City's World Trade Center and not marvel at the book's eerie and moving prescience. Of course Margaret Wheatley has already earned herself a (deserved and legit) reputation as the Oprah of "sensitive" organizational books with such titles as <i>A Simpler Way</i>. But this book--devoted entirely to centrality of conversation in healing everything from personal relationships to organizational dysfunction to world discord--flows so broadly and easily across the borders of genre or topic it's almost as though Wheatley intuited when writing it how the need for its message would soon skyrocket. "The intent of this book is to encourage and support you to begin conversations about things that are important to you and those near you," Wheatley writes right up front in the clean, straightforward voice that always saves her work, unlike that of so many other "New Age" gurus, from cheesiness. "It has no other purpose." She then delivers on that promise, making her points in short, succinct, finely written essays on various aspects of human understanding and connection, invoking the thinking of great humanists like Paolo Friere and Nelson Mandela, peppering her thoughts with encounters with people around the world, and then expanding on 10 "conversation starters" like "Do I feel a 'vocation to be truly human'?" "When have I experienced good listening?" and "When have I experienced working for the common good?" <p> Suffice to say, those looking for some worksheet-packed, three-step plan for organizational harmony won't find it here. Those willing to take a slower, harder, more thoughtful and likely more rewarding path to better relations on any level--or even those looking for the book equivalent of a cool, tall drink of water (perhaps where all change begins)--will be truly moved and genuinely inspired by Wheatley's practical, timely wisdom. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i></p>Margaret J.

She is the author of Leadership and the New Science, a groundbreaking international bestseller (translated into 12 languages), which was named Best Management Book of the Year by Industry Week magazine, one of the Top Ten Business Books of the 1990s by CIO magazine, and one of the Top 10 Business Books of All Time by Xerox Business Services Magazine.

Get inspired, feel confident, and make beautiful clothing you'll be proud to wear!</p><p><p><b> Featured Tips from <em>The Collect Sewing Handbook</em>: Seam Finishes</b></p> <p> <strong>Finishing raw edges will extend the life of your garment, keeping the cut edges of your fabric from raveling and possibly destroying the integrity of your seams.</strong></p> <p><b> Bound Edge [<em>pictured</em>]</b></p> <p> This is a method of finishing an edge, such as a neckline or sleeve hem, by enclosing it with bias tape. The seam allowance will vary, depending on the size of the bias tape you use. Use a bound edge when your pattern calls for one, such as the Taffy Blouse pattern in this chapter. You can purchase bias tape, or make your own.</p> <p><b> French Seam</b></p> <p> A French seam is sewn twice, encasing the raw edges within the seam. It creates a very neat, narrow seam, making it perfect for sheer or very light fabrics. It's not suited for heavy fabrics, since it will create too much bulk.</p> <p><b> Flat Felled Seam</b></p> <p> Flat felled seams are quite strong and are found often in tailored shirts or trousers. Take a look at your favorite jeans and you'll find flat felled seams. Use this technique when extra strength or durability is needed.</p> <p><b> Bound Seam</b></p> <p> A bound seam uses binding around the raw edges of a stitched seam. Because of its bulk, it can show through on lighter fabrics, so it's most often used with very sturdy fabrics such as denim, or on jackets and outerwear. It's a wonderful opportunity to use a fun color or printed binding, to add some flash to the inside of your garment.</p> <p><b> Serged Seam</b></p> <p> Serging is what you will see most often in ready-to-wear clothing. Raw edges are stitched with a special machine called a serger, which holds multiple spools of thread and trims the seams as it sews. If you don't have a serger, you can try zigzag stitching over the raw edges of your seam allowance, or use your sewing machine's overlock stitch if it has one. Be aware that this uses a considerable amount of thread.</p> <p><b> Pinked Seam</b></p> <p> Pinked seams are simple to create, requiring just a pair of pinking shears. The zigzag pattern of the cut edge keeps the fabric from raveling. Pinked seams are commonly found within vintage garments, which goes to show that they can last. Use pinked seams on cottons and other somewhat sturdy fabrics that are not very prone to fraying.</p>Sarai Mitnick is the founder and designer behind Colette Patterns, a boutique sewing pattern company with a vintage-modern twist.

Now, <i>The Silver Slippers</i> takes a dramatic new turn with a fresh redesign featuring a new cover and an irresistible 5" x 6 1�2" trim size--a smaller book for smaller hands, and the perfect stocking stuffer.

In their own words, unfiltered and uncensored, a dazzling galaxy of trail-blazing talents recalled three turbulent decades of on-camera antics and off-camera escapades. Now a fourth decade has passed---and bestselling authors James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales have returned to Studio 8H. Over more than 100 pages of new material, they raucously and revealingly take the SNL story up to the present, adding a constellation of iconic new stars, surprises, and controversies.</p><p>James Andrew Miller is an award-winning journalist who has also worked in the entertainment side of television production and development.

And dozens of other celebrities, sketches, and cast . . . do not appear on this program except in disembodied form as a platoon of experienced readers slog through this tell-all history of SNL. That's the main weakness of this set. Though we learn in detail the peccadilloes of the long history of the show, no original cast members and not one minute of show outtakes grace the hours and hours of talk. This would be a fantastic journey if only the publisher had shelled out the licensing fees and reimbursed the stars. You know when a potentially great listen gets so boring that your brain gets numb? Yeah, I hate it when that happens!

They want work that not only pays the bills but also allows them to pursue their real passions. In this revised edition, Laurence Boldt updates and revises his revolutionary guide to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century workplace. The first part of this book helps readers to identify the work that they really want to do, while the second provides practical, active steps to finding or creating that work. <i>Zen and the</i> <i>Art of Making a Living</i> goes beyond inspiration, providing a proven formula for bringing creativity, dignity, and meaning to every aspect of the work experience.</p><p>The bad old days of multiple-choice-test career counseling are over. It takes more than a #2 pencil and a computer to find your life's work, as career consultant Laurence G.

Boldt is quite up-front about it, though: it's a long, hard journey to get there. But his uplifting prose and liberal doses of inspirational quotes from wise men and women provide support for the weary traveler. Indeed, in between learning how to find the kind of work that strikes the right chord for you, figuring out what skills and talents you'll need to succeed at it, and righteously persisting until you get your reward, you may find lapses and stumbling blocks you hadn't expected--but Boldt has seen them all and finds the right words at the right time to keep you moving.

There they learn that a relic holding the power to wipe out humankind has been stolen. The world faces physical and metaphysical peril, and Pendergast must do battle with this ancient ominous force.

In A Question of Belief, Brunetti must contend with ingenious corruption, bureaucratic intransigence, and the stifling heat of a Venetian summer. With his hometown beset by hordes of tourists and baking under a glaring sun, Brunetti?s greatest wish is to go to the mountains with his family, where he can sleep under a down comforter and catch up on his reading. But before he can go on vacation, a folder with court records has landed on his desk, brought by an old friend. It appears that cases at the local court&#x2014;hardly known as a model of efficiency&#x2014;are being delayed to the benefit of one of the parties. A creative new trick for corrupting the system, perhaps, but what can Brunetti do about it? And just when it looks like Brunetti will be able to get</p><p>Donna Leon was named by The Times as one of the 50 Greatest Crime Writers. She is an award-winning crime novelist, celebrated for the bestselling Brunetti series. Donna has lived in Venice for thirty years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China, where she worked as a teacher. Donna&#39;s books have been translated into 35 languages and have been published around the world. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed; including Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Fatal Remedies, Doctored Evidence, A Sea of Troubles and Beastly Things.The much-admired atmosphere of Donna Leon&#x2019;s mysteries derives from more than their pungent descriptions of Venetian life. Not that we don&#x2019;t appreciate the scenic walks and vaporetto rides. . . . The special atmosphere that permeates Leon&#x2019;s novels and especially her latest, <i>A Question of Belief</i> has more to do with the sense it conveys of a Venice teetering on the edge of oblivion and living on the faith that it won&#x2019;t fall in. Brunetti thus has a dual function: to chronicle the city&#x2019;s decline as it collapses under the forces of progress and its own internal corruption, and to save it from itself, one crime at a time.&#x201d; Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> <b>Brunetti is a marvel</b>: smart, cultured, and dedicated to his work.&#x201d; <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> Fast-paced, with a strong cast and a powerful look at Venice and its local government.&#x201d; Harriet Klausner, <i>The Mystery Gazette</i><br><br> <b>Wonderful</b>.&#x201d; Nina Sankovitch, <i>The Huffington Post</i><br><br> It&#x2019;s hot as Hades in Venice, and Commissario Guido Brunetti is feeling the heat in this 19th installment in the best-selling series. Not only is the temperature soaring, but Brunetti is working on several hot, puzzling cases. As always, he is a superb police detective calm, deliberate, and insightful as he investigates with a reflective thoroughness. Unfortunately, just when Brunetti thinks he can finally escape on vacation to cooler climes, he is recalled to Venice because of a brutal murder. In the end, he solves one case, but the solution to the other remains hellishly ambiguous. Leon&#x2019;s daring, provocative conclusion leads us to reflect upon the pernicious consequences of the usual culprits: sex, love, ambition, and greed. <b>An excellent read,</b> especially for those who enjoy intelligent, urbane, literary mysteries set in Europe.&#x201d; Lynne F. Maxwell, <i>Library Journal</i><br><br> <b>If you are not reading Donna Leon&#x2019;s novels with Venice Police Commissario Guido Brunetti, then you are missing out</b>. You won&#x2019;t find an abundance of violence here. Instead, you can expect clever plotting, solid characterization and fine storytelling. If you are wondering why <i>Time</i> named Leon one of the top 50 mystery writers, then <i>A Question of Belief</i> will answer that question conclusively.&#x201d; Joe Hartlaub, <i>Bookreporter.com</i><br><br> <b>Beautifully written, atmospheric and redolent of an Italian summer at its murderous best.</b>&#x201d; Bruce Tierney, <i>Book Page</i><br><br> With her trademark flair and grace, Leon imbues <i>A Question of Belief</i> with a conclusion at once stunning and ambivalent and an atmospheric evocation of Venice, either of which would be reason for celebration. But she is not content to confine her gifts, and the third leg of her genius, rich characterization, is again on display as the reader&#x2019;s appreciation of Brunetti continues to grow. <b>Literate and lovely, <i>A Question of Belief</i> reaffirms Leon&#x2019;s place in the firmament of the genre.</b>&#x201d; Jay Strafford, <i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i><br><br> There are a bare handful of mystery authors who can maintain quality over 19 books. There are even fewer who can claim the latest works are some of their best. <i>A Question of Belief</i> puts Donna Leon in that category. It is a stunning novel, the best of this brilliant series, with a twist at the end that will leave even the most sophisticated reader gasping. . . . Fans shouldn&#x2019;t miss this, and if you&#x2019;re not already a devotee, start here and work your way backward.&#x201d; Margaret Cannon, <i>The Globe and Mail</i> (Canada)<br><br> Leon's books are a joy, and the 19th Venice-based Commissario Brunetti novel is well up to her consistently high standard.&#x201d; Laura Wilson, <i>The Guardian</i> (UK)<br><br> Leon vividly churns the social and political stew of her adopted city through Brunetti's eternally dismayed but unvanquished eyes. Despite a wry, laconic delivery, her soft, lingering touch reveals a keen compassion as Brunetti's cynical fatalism vies with a stubborn faith.&#x201d; John Sullivan, <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i><br></p><h2>Intuitive Color &amp; Design: Adventures in Art Quilting</h2><p>11 lessons help quilters break out of the block and create quilts with a whole new level of artistic freedom.</p><p>Jean Wells is a hugely successful and popular quilter.

When Corbin Dell, a distant cousin in Boston, suggests the two temporarily swap apartments, Kate, an art student in London, agrees, hoping that time away in a new place will help her overcome the recent wreckage of her life. </p><p>But soon after her arrival at Corbin&#x2019;s grand apartment on Beacon Hill, Kate makes a shocking discovery: his next-door neighbor, a young woman named Audrey Marshall, has been murdered. When the police question her about Corbin, a shaken Kate has few answers, and many questions of her own&#x2014;curiosity that intensifies when she meets Alan Cherney, a handsome, quiet tenant who lives across the courtyard, in the apartment facing Audrey&#x2019;s. Alan saw Corbin surreptitiously come and go from Audrey&#x2019;s place, yet he&#x2019;s denied knowing her. Then, Kate runs into a tearful man claiming to be the dead woman&#x2019;s old boyfriend, who insists Corbin did the deed the night that he left for London. </p><p>When she reaches out to her cousin, he proclaims his innocence and calms her nerves . . . until she comes across disturbing objects hidden in the apartment&#x2014;and accidently learns that Corbin is not where he says he is. Could Corbin be a killer? And what about Alan? Kate finds herself drawn to this appealing man who seems so sincere, yet she isn&#x2019;t sure. Jetlagged and emotionally unstable, her imagination full of dark images caused by the terror of her past, Kate can barely trust herself . . . So how could she take the chance on a stranger she&#x2019;s just met? </p><p>Yet the danger Kate imagines isn&#x2019;t nearly as twisted and deadly as what&#x2019;s about to happen.

When Corbin Dell, a cousin in Boston, suggests the two temporarily swap apartments, Kate agrees, hoping that time away in a new place will help her overcome the past traumas of her life.</p><p>But at Corbin&#x2019;s grand apartment on Beacon Hill, Kate makes a shocking discovery: his next-door neighbor, a young woman named Audrey, has been murdered. When the police question her about Corbin, a shaken Kate has few answers, but many questions of her own&#x2014;and her curiosity intensifies when she meets Alan, a handsome tenant who lives across the courtyard. Alan saw Corbin surreptitiously come and go from Audrey&#x2019;s place, yet Corbin&#x2019;s denied knowing her. Then, Kate runs into a man claiming to be the dead woman&#x2019;s old boyfriend, who insists Corbin did the deed.</p><p>Corbin proclaims his innocence and calms Kate&#x2019;s nerves . . . until she comes across disturbing objects hidden in the apartment. Could Corbin really be a killer? And what about Alan? Kate finds herself drawn to this appealing man who seems so sincere, but she isn&#x2019;t sure. Jet-lagged and emotionally fragile, her imagination full of dark images, Kate can barely trust herself, let alone a stranger she&#x2019;s just met. Yet the danger Kate imagines isn&#x2019;t nearly as twisted as what is about to happen.

Despite their criminal nature, the yakuza are accepted by fellow Japanese to a degree guaranteed to shock most Westerners. Here is the first book to reveal the extraordinary reach of Japan's Mafia. Originally published in 1986, <i>Yakuza </i>was so controversial in Japan that it could not be published there for five years. But in the West it has long served as the standard reference on Japanese organized crime, inspiring novels, screenplays, and criminal investigations. David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro spent nearly two decades conducting hundreds of interviews with everyone from street-level hoodlums and police to Japan's most powerful godfathers. The result is a searing indictment of corruption in the world's second-largest economy.<br><br>This updated, expanded, and thoroughly revised edition of <i>Yakuza </i>tells the full story of Japan's remarkable crime syndicates, from their feudal start as bands of medieval outlaws to their emergence as billion-dollar investors in real estate, big business, art, and more.</p><p>"A fascinating study of how criminal enterprise can infect the very heart of modern capitalism. Here is the backstage world of political influence and organized crime in the world's second largest economy... by far the most detailed and even-handed study of this important and neglected subject."&#x2014;John W. Dower, author of <i>Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II</i><br><br><b>Reviews of original edition:</b><br><br>"A superb study of Japan's underworld that is both entertaining and revealing. The authors miss none of the color and curious detail of the yakuza style, but at the same time go far beyond surface observations."&#x2014;<i>Far Eastern Economic Review</i><br><br>"The book is laden with fascinating information, some of it heretofore unavailable in English."&#x2014;<i>Washington Post </i><br><br>"Blend the Mafia with the Masons.

Eventually adopted by a pair of well-meaning white professors, Deming is moved from the Bronx to a small town upstate and renamed Daniel Wilkinson. But far from all he&#x2019;s ever known, Daniel struggles to reconcile his adoptive&nbsp;parents&#x2019; desire that he assimilate with his memories of his mother and the community he left behind.&nbsp;<br> Told from the perspective of both Daniel&#x2014;as he grows into a directionless young man&#x2014;and Polly, Ko&#x2019;s novel gives us one of fiction&#x2019;s most singular mothers.

She has been awarded fellowships and residencies from the New York Foundation for the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Writers OMI at Ledig House, the Jerome Foundation, and Blue Mountain Center, among others. She was born in New York City, where she now lives.The day before Deming Guo saw his mother for the last time, she surprised him at school. A navy blue hat sat low on her forehead, scarf around her neck like a big brown snake. &#x201c;What are you waiting for, Kid? It&#x2019;s cold out.&#x201d;<br><br> He stood in the doorway of PS 33 as she zipped his coat so hard the collar pinched. &#x201c;Did you get off work early?&#x201d; It was four thirty, already dark, but she didn&#x2019;t usually leave the nail salon until six.<br><br> They spoke, as always, in Fuzhounese. &#x201c;Short shift. Michael said you had to stay late to get help on an assignment.&#x201d; Her eyes narrowed behind her glasses, and he couldn&#x2019;t tell if she bought it or not. Teachers didn&#x2019;t call your mom when you got detention, only gave a form you had to return with a signature, which he forged. Michael, who never got detention, had left after eighth period, and Deming wanted to get back home with him, in front of the television, where, in the safety of a laugh track, he didn&#x2019;t have to worry about letting anyone down.<br><br> Snow fell like clots of wet laundry. Deming and his mother walked up Jerome Avenue. In the back of a concrete courtyard three older boys were passing a blunt, coats unzipped, wearing neither backpacks nor hats, sweet smoke and slow laughter warming the thin February air. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to be like that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to be like me. I didn&#x2019;t even finish eighth grade.&#x201d;<br><br> What a sweet idea, not finishing eighth grade. He could barely finish fifth. His teachers said it was an issue of focus, of not applying himself. Yet when he tripped Travis Bhopa in math class Deming had been as shocked as Travis was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come to your school tomorrow,&#x201d; his mother said, &#x201c;talk to your teacher about that assignment.&#x201d; He kept his arm against his mother&#x2019;s, loved the scratchy sound of their jackets rubbing together. She wasn&#x2019;t one of those TV moms, always hugging their kids or watching them with bemused smiles, but insisted on holding his hand when they crossed a busy street. Inside her gloves her hands were red and scraped, the skin angry and peeling, and every night before she went to sleep she rubbed a thick lotion onto her fingers and winced. Once he asked if it made them hurt less. She said only for a little while, and he wished there was a special lotion that could make new skin grow, a pair of superpower gloves.<br><br> Short and blocky, she wore loose jeans&#x2014;never had he seen her in a dress&#x2014;and her voice was so loud that when she called his name dogs would bark and other kids jerked around. When she saw his last report card he thought her shouting would set off the car alarms four stories below. But her laughter was as loud as her shouting, and there was no better, more gratifying sound than when she slapped her knee and cackled at something silly. She laughed at things that weren&#x2019;t meant to be funny, like TV dramas and the swollen orchestral soundtracks that accompanied them, or, better yet, at things Deming said, like when he nailed the way their neighbor Tommie always went, &#x201c;Not-bad-not-bad-not-bad&#x201d; when they passed him in the stairwell, an automatic response to a &#x201c;Hello-how-are-you&#x201d; that hadn&#x2019;t yet been issued. Or the time she&#x2019;d asked, flipping through TV stations, &#x201c;<i>Dancing with the Stars</i> isn&#x2019;t on?&#x201d; and he had excavated Michael&#x2019;s old paper mobile of the solar system and waltzed with it through the living room as she clapped. It was almost as good as getting cheered on by his friends.<br><br> When he had lived in Minjiang with his grandfather, Deming&#x2019;s mother had explored New York by herself. There was a restlessness to her, an inability to be still or settled. She jiggled her legs, bounced her knees, cracked her knuckles, twirled her thumbs. She hated being cooped up in the apartment on a sunny day, paced the rooms from wall to wall to wall, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. &#x201c;Who wants to go for a walk?&#x201d; she would say. Her boyfriend Leon would tell her to relax, sit down. &#x201c;Sit down? We&#x2019;ve been sitting all day!&#x201d; Deming would want to stay on the couch with Michael, but he couldn&#x2019;t say no to her and they&#x2019;d go out, no family but each other. He would have her to himself, an ambling walk in the park or along the river, making up stories about who lived in the apartments they saw from the outside&#x2014;a family named Smith, five kids, father dead, mother addicted to bagels, he speculated the day they went to the Upper East Side. &#x201c;To bagels?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What flavor bagel?&#x201d; &#x201c;Everything bagels,&#x201d; he said, which made her giggle harder, until they were both bent over on Madison Avenue, laughing so hard no sounds were coming out, and his stomach hurt but he couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing, old white people giving them stink eye for stopping in the middle of the sidewalk. Deming and his mother loved everything bagels, the sheer balls of it, the New York audacity that a bagel could proclaim to be everything, even if it was only topped with sesame seeds and poppy seeds and salt.<br><br> A bus lumbered past, spraying slush. The walk sign flashed on. &#x201c;You know what I did today?&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;One lady, she had a callus the size of your nose on her heel. I had to scrape all that dead skin off. It took forever. And her tip was shit. You&#x2019;ll never do that, if you&#x2019;re careful.&#x201d;<br><br> He dreaded this familiar refrain. His mother could curse, but the one time he&#x2019;d let <i>motherfucker</i> bounce out in front of her, loving the way the syllables got meatbally in his mouth, she had slapped his arm and said he was better than that. Now he silently said the word to himself as he walked, one syllable per footstep.<br><br> &#x201c;Did you think that when I was growing up, a small girl your age, I thought: hey, one day, I&#x2019;m going to come all the way to New York so I can pick gao gao out of a stranger&#x2019;s toe? That was not my plan.&#x201d;<br><br> Always be prepared, she liked to say. Never rely on anyone else to give you things you could get yourself. She despised laziness, softness, people who were weak. She had few friends, but was true to the ones she had. She could hold a fierce grudge, would walk an extra three blocks to another grocery store because, two years ago, a cashier at the one around the corner had smirked at her lousy English. It was lousy, Deming agreed.<br><br> &#x201c;Take Leon, for instance. He look okay to you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Leon&#x2019;s always okay.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;His back&#x2019;s screwed up. His shoulders are busted. Men don&#x2019;t work in nail salons. You don&#x2019;t finish school, you end up cutting meat like Leon, arthritis by the time you&#x2019;re thirty-five.&#x201d;<br><br> It seemed disloyal to talk like this about Yi Ba Leon, who was so strong he&#x2019;d do one-arm push-ups for Deming and Michael and their friends, let them punch him in the gut for kicks, though Deming stopped short of punching as hard as he could. &#x201c;Do it again,&#x201d; Leon would say. &#x201c;You call that a punch? That&#x2019;s a handshake. Even if Leon wasn&#x2019;t his real father&#x2014;on this topic, his mother was so tightlipped that all he knew about the man was that he&#x2019;d never been around&#x2014;he made Deming proud. If he could grow up to be like any man, he wanted to be like Leon, or the guy who played the saxophone in the subway station, surrounded by people as his fingers danced and his chest heaved and the tunnel filled with flashes of purples and oranges. Oh, to be loved like that!<br><br> Fordham Road was unusually quiet in the snow. Ice covered the sidewalk in front of an abandoned building, a reddish piece of gum clinging to it like a lonely pepperoni atop a frozen pizza. &#x201c;This winter is never-ending,&#x201d; Deming&#x2019;s mother said, and they gripped each other&#x2019;s arms for balance as they made their way across the sidewalk. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to get out of here, go somewhere warm?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s warm at home.&#x201d; In their apartment, if they could just get there, the heat was blasting. Some days they even wore T-shirts inside.<br><br> His mother scowled. &#x201c;I was the first girl in my village to go to the provincial capital. I made it all the way to New York. I was supposed to travel the world.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But then.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But then I had you. Then I met Leon. You&#x2019;re my home now.&#x201d; They started up the hill on University Avenue. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re moving.&#x201d;<br><br> He stopped in a slush puddle. &#x201c;What? Where?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Florida. I got a new job at a restaurant. It&#x2019;s near this Disney World. I&#x2019;ll take you there.&#x201d; She grinned at him like she was expecting a grin back.<br><br> &#x201c;Is Yi Ba Leon coming?&#x201d;<br><br> She pulled him away from the puddle. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What about Michael and Vivian?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll join us later.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The job starts soon. In a week or two.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A week? I have school.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Since when do you love school so much?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I have friends.&#x201d; Travis Bhopa had been calling Michael and Deming cockroaches for months, and the impulse to stick a foot out as he lumbered down the aisle was brilliant, spontaneous, the look on Travis&#x2019;s face one of disbelief, the sound of Travis&#x2019;s body going down an oozy plop. Michael and their friends had high-fived him. <i>Badass, Deming!</i> Detention had been worth it.<br><br> They stood in front of the bodega. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to go to a good school. The new job is going to pay good money. We&#x2019;ll live in a quiet town.&#x201d;<br><br> Her voice was a trumpet, her words sharp triangles. Deming remembered the years without her, the silent house on 3 Alley with Yi Gong, and saw a street so quiet he could only hear himself blink. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m your mother. You have to go with me.&#x201d;<br><br> The bodega door slammed shut. Mrs. Johnson, who lived in their building, walked out with two plastic bags.<br><br> &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t with me when I was in China,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;Yi Gong was with you then. I was working so I could save money to have you here. It&#x2019;s different now.&#x201d;<br><br> He removed his hand from hers. &#x201c;Different how?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love Florida. You&#x2019;ll have a big house and your own room.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want my own room. I want Michael there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve moved before. It wasn&#x2019;t so hard, was it?&#x201d;<br><br> The light had changed, but Mrs. Johnson remained on their side of the street, watching them. University Avenue wasn&#x2019;t Chinatown, where they had lived before moving in with Leon in the Bronx. There were no other Fuzhounese families on their block, and sometimes people looked at them like their language had come out of the drain.<br><br> Deming answered in English. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going. Leave me alone.&#x201d;<br><br> She raised her hand. He jolted back as she lunged forward. Then she hugged him, the snowy front of her jacket brushing against his cheek, his nose pressing into her chest. He could hear her heartbeat through the layers of clothing, thumping and determined, and before he could relax he forced himself to wriggle out of her arms and race up the block, backpack bumping against his spine. She clomped after him in her plastic boots, hooting as she slid across the sidewalk.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash</h2><p>How could you, a mathematician, believe that extraterrestrials were sending you messages?" the visitor from Harvard asked the West Virginian with the movie-star looks and Olympian manner. <p>"Because the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way my mathematical ideas did," came the answer. "So I took them seriously." </p><p>Thus begins the true story of John Nash, the mathematical genius who was a legend by age thirty when he slipped into madness, and who -- thanks to the selflessness of a beautiful woman and the loyalty of the mathematics community -- emerged after decades of ghostlike existence to win a Nobel Prize and world acclaim. The inspiration for a major motion picture, Sylvia Nasar's award-winning biography is a drama about the mystery of the human mind, triumph over incredible adversity, and the healing power of love.</p></p><p>Stories of famously eccentric Princetonians abound--such as that of chemist Hubert Alyea, the model for <i>The Absent-Minded Professor</i>, or Ralph Nader, said to have had his own key to the library as an undergraduate. Or the "Phantom of Fine Hall," a figure many students had seen shuffling around the corridors of the math and physics building wearing purple sneakers and writing numerology treatises on the blackboards. The Phantom was John Nash, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of his generation, who had spiraled into schizophrenia in the 1950s. His most important work had been in game theory, which by the 1980s was underpinning a large part of economics. When the Nobel Prize committee began debating a prize for game theory, Nash's name inevitably came up--only to be dismissed, since the prize clearly could not go to a madman. But in 1994 Nash, in remission from schizophrenia, shared the Nobel Prize in economics for work done some 45 years previously.<p>Economist and journalist Sylvia Nasar has written a biography of Nash that looks at all sides of his life. She gives an intelligent, understandable exposition of his mathematical ideas and a picture of schizophrenia that is evocative but decidedly unromantic. Her story of the machinations behind Nash's Nobel is fascinating and one of very few such accounts available in print (the CIA could learn a thing or two from the Nobel committees). This highly recommended book is indeed "a story about the mystery of the human mind, in three acts: genius, madness, reawakening." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><b>Sylvia Nasar</b> is the author of the bestselling <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for biography.

Reprint.</p><p>Otherland, the quartet of which <i>Mountain of Black Glass</i> is the powerful third part, combines some terrifying speculation on the future of virtual reality with adventures no less terrifying because they are technologized dreaming. These are dreams the adventurers cannot awaken from and in which, if they die, they are really dead.<p> An epidemic of comatose children has led Renie and her San friend !Xabbu into the net and to a series of dream worlds created as palaces by the corrupt aspiring immortals, the Grail Brotherhood. Two of those children, Orlando and Fredericks, have become adventurers in their own right, while their parents' lawyer Ramsey follows real-world money and lesbian cop Calliope tracks a serial killer with serious ambitions to become an angry god. In this volume, adventures take place in a mythic ancient Egypt and a rambling Gormenghastlike house before all the virtual adventurers meet where they were always destined to, before the walls of Troy.</p><p> </p><blockquote> "All around, death. It was not a quiet presence during the long day--not a pale-faced maiden bringing surcease from pain, not a skillful reaper with a scalpel-sharp blade.... Death on the Trojan plain was a crazed beast that roared and clawed and smashed, which was everywhere at once, and which in its unending fury showed that even armored men were terribly frail things." </blockquote><p> Tad Williams takes the gameworld and turns it on its head, passionately; how do we know that what bleeds does not feel pain?

Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap.</em></blockquote><p>Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man <em>(the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night),</em> and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: <em>She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control.</em></p><p>Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful "monkey"; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle "bunny." From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. <em>I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear,</em> Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, <em>he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it.</em></p><p>But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. </p><p>To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the <em>sostegno del famiglia,</em> was born. <em>Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went.</em> Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, <em>The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings.</em> </p><p>Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. </p><p>Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, <em>I Know This Much Is True</em> is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched. </p></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, June 1998:</b> What if you were a 40-year-old housepainter, horrifically abused, emotionally unavailable, and your identical twin was a paranoid schizophrenic who believed in public self-mutilation? You'd either be a guest on the <i>Jerry Springer Show</i> or Dominick Birdsey, the antihero, narrator, and bad-juju magnet of <i>I Know This Much Is True</i>. Somewhere in the recesses of this hefty 912-page tome lurks an honest, moving account of one man's search, denial, and acceptance of self. This is no easy feat considering his grandfather seemed to take parenting tips from the SS and his grandmother was a possible teenage murderess, his stepfather a latent sadist, and his brother, Thomas, a politically motivated psychopath. Not one to break with tradition, Dominick continues the dysfunctional legacy with rape, a failed marriage, a nervous breakdown, SIDS, a car crash, and a racist conspiracy against a coworker--just to name a few. <p> A stretch, both literally and figuratively from his Oprah-christened bestseller, <i>She's Come Undone</i>, Lamb's book ventures outside the confines of the tightly bound beach read and marathons through a detailed, neatly cataloged account of every familial travesty and personal failure one can endure. At its heart lies Freud's "return of the repressed": the more we try to deny who we are, the more we become what we fear. Lamb takes Freud's psychological abstraction to the realm of everyday living, packing his novel with tender, believable dialogue and thoughtful observation. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>Reading a novel is a highly personal experience and I think different readers will take different things from it. As for me, the experience of writing the book has reinforced for me the truths that Dominick had to learn: that love grows from forgiveness, that mongrels make good dogs, and that the roundness of life&#39;s design may be a sign that there is a presence beyond ourselves. --From a recent interview with Wally Lamb, author of I Know This Much Is True</p><h2>We the Living</h2><p>An exploration of the eternal human struggle between the human individual and the state offers the first installment of Rand&#39;s philosophy of Objectivism and features an introduction by the author&#39;s heir, Leonard Peikoff.

He explains that global economy is shouldered by trust, and that we need to trust the people we interact with, customers, co-workers and managers, in order to function in this world. He explains how trust empowers our transactions and how to establish trust. He provides anecdotes and examples of how organizations can eliminate time-wasting bureaucratic checks and install a system of trust to believe in their employees and in their ability to carry out their responsibilities. He shows that costs come down when a company trusts its employees more. This principle is further reinforced by his stories of how democratic capitalism has succeeded where the old models have failed. His principles show readers that the trust they place in the people they interact with may sometimes be more valuable than the outcome of the interaction itself, making valuable decisive factors in future transactions.</p><p>Stephen M. R. Covey is a Harvard MBA and the former CEO of the Covey Leadership Center which, under his stewardship, became the largest leadership development company in the world. He is in demand as a leading authority on creating high-performance organizations. He lives in Utah.<p><b>From Nothing is as Fast as the Speed of Trust</b></p><p></p><blockquote><p><i>Speed happens when people . . . truly trust each other</i>.</p><p>-- EDWARD MARSHALL</p><p><i>If you're not fast, you're dead</i>.</p><p>-- JACK WELCH</p></blockquote><p>I'll never forget an experience I had several years ago when I worked for a short stint with a major investment banking firm in New York City. We had just come out of a very exhausting meeting, during which it had become evident that there were serious internal trust issues. These issues were slowing things down and negatively affecting execution. The senior leader said to me privately, "These meetings are dysfunctional and a waste of time. I just don't trust 'Mike.' I don't trust 'Ellen.' In fact, I find it hard to trust anyone in this group."</p><p>I said, "Well, why don't you work on increasing trust?"</p><p>He turned to me and replied seriously, "Look, Stephen, you need to understand something. Either you have trust or you don't. We don't have it, and there's nothing we can do about it."</p><p>I strongly disagree. In fact, both my personal life and my work as a business practitioner over the past 20 years have convinced me that there is a <i>lot</i> we can do about it. We <i>can</i> increase trust -- much faster than we might think -- and doing so will have a huge impact, both in the quality of our lives and in the results we're able to achieve.</p><p></p><p><b>TRUST ISSUES AFFECT EVERYONE</b></p><p>As I speak to audiences around the world about the Speed of Trust, I repeatedly hear expressions of frustration and discouragement such as these:</p><blockquote><p><i>I can't stand the politics at work. I feel sabotaged by my peers. It seems like everyone is out for himself and will do anything to get ahead.</i></p><p><i>I've really been burned in the past. How can I ever trust anyone enough to have a real relationship?</i></p><p><i>I work in an organization that's bogged down with bureaucracy. It takes forever to get anything done. I have to get authorization to buy a pencil!</i></p><p><i>The older my children get, the less they listen to me. What can I do?</i></p><p><i>I feel like my contributions at work are hardly ever recognized or valued.</i></p><p><i>I foolishly violated the trust of someone who was supremely important to me. If I could hit "rewind" and make the decision differently, I would do it in a heartbeat. But I can't. Will I ever be able to rebuild the relationship?</i></p><p><i>I have to walk on eggshells at work. If I say what I really think, I'll get fired . . . or at least made irrelevant.</i></p><p><i>My boss micromanages me and everyone else at work. He treats us all like we can't be trusted. </i></p><p><i>With all the scandals, corruption, and ethical violations in our society today, I feel like someone has pulled the rug out from under me. I don't know what -- or who -- to trust anymore.</i></p></blockquote><p>So what do you do if you're in a situation like one of these -- or in any situation where a lack of trust creates politics and bureaucracy, or simply slows things down? Do you merely accept this as the cost of doing business? Or can you do something to counteract or even reverse it?</p><p>I affirm that you <i>can</i> do something about it. In fact, by learning how to establish, grow, extend, and restore trust, you can positively and significantly alter the trajectory of this and every future moment of your life.</p><p></p><p><b>GETTING A HANDLE ON TRUST</b></p><p>So what is trust? Rather than giving a complex definition, I prefer to use the words of Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric. He said, "[Y]ou know it when you feel it."</p><p>Simply put, trust means <i>confidence</i>. The opposite of trust -- distrust -- is <i>suspicion</i>. When you trust people, you have confidence in them -- in their integrity and in their abilities. When you distrust people, you are suspicious of them -- of their integrity, their agenda, their capabilities, or their track record. It's that simple. We have all had experiences that validate the difference between relationships that are built on trust and those that are not. These experiences clearly tell us the difference is not small; it is dramatic.</p><p>Take a minute right now and think of a person with whom you have a high trust relationship -- perhaps a boss, coworker, customer, spouse, parent, sibling, child, or friend. Describe this relationship. What's it like? How does it feel? How well do you communicate? How quickly can you get things done? How much do you enjoy this relationship?</p><p>Now think of a person with whom you have a low-trust relationship. Again, this person could be anyone at work or at home. Describe this relationship. What's it like? How does it feel? How is the communication? Does it flow quickly and freely . . . or do you feel like you're constantly walking on land mines and being misunderstood? Do you work together to get things done quickly . . . or does it take a disproportionate amount of time and energy to finally reach agreement and execution? Do you enjoy this relationship . . . or do you find it tedious, cumbersome, and draining?</p><p>The difference between a high- and low-trust relationship is palpable! Take communication. In a high-trust relationship, you can say the wrong thing, and people will still get your meaning. In a low-trust relationship, you can be very measured, even precise, and they'll still misinterpret you.</p><p>Can you even begin to imagine the difference it would make if you were able to increase the amount of trust in the important personal and professional relationships in your life?</p><p></p><p><b>THE CRUCIBLE</b></p><p>One of the most formative experiences I've had personally in increasing trust occurred several years ago as a result of the merger between Franklin Quest and Covey Leadership Center to form FranklinCovey Company. As anyone who has ever been through a merger or an acquisition will know, these things are never easy. The merged company had terrific strengths. We had great people, superb content, loyal clients, and productive tools. But the blending of the two cultures was proving to be enormously challenging.</p><p>As president of the Training and Education business unit, I had traveled to Washington, D.C., to address about a third of our consultants on the topic of our division's strategy. But a meeting that should have had me looking forward with anticipation literally had my stomach churning.</p><p>Several weeks before, the company's new CEO -- frustrated (as we all were) with the enormous problems and friction that had beset what had seemed to be a promising merger -- had scheduled a meeting of all the consultants in the company. In an effort to "get out" everyone's concerns, he had created a format in which we, as leaders, were to listen, but could not respond, to anything anyone wanted to say. The meeting, scheduled to last four hours, turned into a 10-hour "dump" session. With no one allowed to amend, correct, give context, supply missing information, discuss the other side of the issues, or even show the dilemmas involved, only a small percentage of what was said had real contextual accuracy. Most was misinterpreted, manipulated, or twisted, and some of it was flat-out wrong. There were assumptions, suspicions, accusations, frustrations. And, as leaders, we had reluctantly agreed to a format in which we weren't permitted to say a word.</p><p>In the end, we'd had over a dozen such meetings. The whole experience had been brutal, and, with my position of leadership, I had taken it all personally. Having had some experience on Wall Street, I knew mergers were usually hard, but I had thought we could do what needed to be done to make this one work.</p><p>The problem was that I had assumed far too much. Mistakenly, I had failed to focus on establishing trust with the newly merged company, believing that my reputation and credibility would already be known. But they weren't, and, as a result, half the people trusted me and the other half didn't. And it was pretty much divided right down Covey or Franklin "party" lines. Those from the Covey side who knew me and had worked with me basically saw my decisions as a sincere effort to use objective, external criteria in every decision and to do what was best for the business -- not to try to push a "Covey" agenda . . . in fact, sometimes even bending over backward to avoid it. Those who didn't know me, hadn't worked with me, and didn't trust me interpreted every decision in the exact opposite manner.</p><p>In one case, for example, a question had come up concerning the use of the Sundance Resort for one of our leadership development programs. Sundance had been somewhat hard to work with, and some felt we should move the program to another venue. The program director strongly wanted to keep it at Sundance because clients loved the location, and the financial data showed that we were averaging nearly 40 percent more revenue per program held there compared to other venues. I said, "Because the economics are better and the program director strongly recommends that we keep it there, we'll find better ways to work with Sundance." That was an example of a solid business decision I assumed people would understand.</p><p>But those who didn't trust me didn't understand. They thought I was trying to push a "Covey" approach. Some even wondered if I was getting some kind of kickback because, as a community leader, I had been asked to serve in an unpaid role on the advisory board for the Sundance Children's Theater. Many suspected my motive. Because there was such low trust, the feeling was, "There's got to be some kind of hidden agenda going on here." </p><p>In another situation, I had made the decision to move "Ron," an extremely talented leader who had come from the Covey side into a different position because, like many of us, he had gotten caught in merger politics and had polarized the two camps. I had decided to go outside the organization for Ron's replacement so that there would be no perception that the new manager was a "Covey" person or a "Franklin" person.</p><p>When I made this announcement, I thought people would be excited by my attempt to bring in new talent. But among those who didn't trust me, no one even heard the part about bringing ...</p></p><h2>There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Shell!</h2><p>"There was an old lady who swallowed a shell.<br>I don't know why she swallowed the shell.<br>She didn't tell."<br><br>You won't believe why this old lady swallows a shell, a crab, a fish, a gull, a pail, some sand, and a wave!

And suddenly this innocent farm girl&#x2015;who still thought the stork brought babies&#x2015;was pregnant. The baby was secretly born, named Betty Jane, and given up for adoption. For decades, Minka wrote letters trying to get news of her daughter; she kept loving and praying for her, even though she never dared believe they would meet again. Until nearly eighty years later, when Minka whispered her secret, impossible prayer for the first time: <i>Lord, I&#x2019;d like to see Betty Jane before I die. I promise I won&#x2019;t bother her or interrupt her life. I just want to lay eyes on her.</i> Unbeknownst to Minka, that very same day, a judge was releasing the sealed adoption records to her 77-year-old daughter. And soon, Minka&#x2019;s phone would ring. Written by Cathy LaGrow (Minka&#x2019;s granddaughter), <i>The Waiting</i> brings three generations of this most unusual family together over the course of a century to tell a story of faith that triumphs, forgiveness that sets us free, and love that never forgets.</p><p><b>It&#x2019;s never too late for a miracle.</b><br>When an old woman begs God to let her see the daughter who had been taken from her arms almost eighty years before&#x2015;could her impossible prayer come true?<br><br>In the summer of 1928, sixteen-year-old Minka was looking forward to a sewing class picnic.

Minka still believed that the stork brought babies; she would not discover for months that she was pregnant.<br><br>The story that follows has been almost a hundred years in the making. What happens when a new mother must make a heartbreaking sacrifice to give her baby daughter the life she deserves? Can her cherished memories carry her through decades of turmoil, during a rapidly changing time in American history?

Having developed conjuring skills and an ability to wriggle free of handcuffs, ropes and manacles, Houdini elaborated his tricks into theatrical set pieces that made him famous--stunts like escaping from a strait jacket while dangling head down from a skyscraper, or from a wooden packing crate submerged in water. Silverman&#39;s meticulously researched book reveals other sides to the great illusionist too. Houdini collected a library of books on magic, wrote books himself, exposed shyster psychics whose tricks he could easily match, and was a friend to Jack London, Sarah Bernhardt and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Kenneth Silverman is Professor English at New York University.</p><h2>Financial Accounting</h2><p>Welcome to the fifth edition of Financial Accounting and, to adopters of the first four editions, thank you for the great success those editions have enjoyed.

Author Judith Barrett lost pounds and inches using these mouthwatering recipes, each of which contains less than three grams of fat per serving. And cutting the fat posed no bar to creating soups with incredible flavor -- Black Mushroom and Spinach Wonton Soup and Creamy Fennel Soup with Shrimp both contain only one gram of fat.<p> Barrett offers soups to be savored for every season. In the fall, Creamy Carrot Soup or Roasted Beet Borscht will delight you. Winter Squash Soup with Thyme or Real Gumbo with Okra and Chicken is sure to take the edge off the cold during the snowy months. Come springtime, there is Vidalia Onion Soup or Arugula Vichyssoise, and to beat the summertime heat, make a batch of Cool Cucumber and Yogurt Soup or Creamy Tomato Bisque with Shallots and Tarragon. You have a veritable calendar full of soup's pleasures at your fingertips. Soups "from the sea," like Mediterranean Fish Stew and New York Red Clam Chowder, will leave a briny tingle on your palate. If it's legumes you crave, try one of the unbeatable bean soups: Lentil and Portobello Mushroom Soup, Miami Black Bean Soup, Lemony Chickpea and Escarole Soup. Or experiment with the variety of international soup recipes that are offered, from Japanese Dashi with Soba and Scallions to Chinese Cabbage Soup with Cellophane Noodles to Italian Minestra of Swiss Chard and Rice. </p><p></p></p><p>Soup seems to revive the spirit even as it contents the stomach. In Judith Barrett's case, it also helped her lose 10 pounds. These low-fat and reasonably low-calorie soups, she claims, provided filling comfort as she cut back on calories and on the overall quantity she ate, helping her lose weight and keep it off.<p> The 100-plus recipes in <i>Saved by Soup</i> contain, at maximum, three grams of fat per three-quarter-cup portion. (Most of us eat more than that, and in restaurants a serving is at least a full cup.)</p><p> Barrett explains how to de-fat homemade stocks and store-bought broth. Her recipes start with a light, clear consomm� graced with angel hair pasta and fine strips of fresh spinach, then progress to hefty Pasta e Fagioli, a section on chowders, chicken soups both thick and thin--including one with fluffy matzoh balls--and verdant spring soups like Creamy Watercress. There are rustic Italian <i>minestre</i> and chilled soups for summer. Perhaps best of all are chili-spiked Racy Red Lentil and clever, chunky Summer Fruit "Minestrone," a melange of fruit cut up in mint-perfumed orange juice.</p><p> The nutritional analysis provided for each recipe proves Barrett's point--that soups can be both lean and flavorful. Glorious color photos show that they can also be eye filling. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p><p>Judith Barrett is a well-known food writer and cookbook author.

Simona mafei is one of the principal editors of Mezzocielo, a Sicilian monthly.Aperture brings to the fore the captivating and politically charged photographs of Sicilian photographer Battaglia. For the last 30 years, Battaglia has documented the many pains and relatively few triumphs of her native Palermo, a city that was, until recently, clenched in the fists of the Cosa Nostra. She covered Mafia killings and suicides, the poverty of the Palermitani, and, most importantly, the maxi trials of the early 1990s, during which prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were assassinated. "I took pictures of everything," Battaglia is quoted as saying. "Suddenly I had an archive of blood." In 1993, police raided Battaglia's studio to uncover any evidence that would link former prime minister Giulio Andreotti to the Mafia. Sure enough, the authorities found a photo that Battaglia didn't realize she had taken of Andreotti with known crime boss Nino Salvo; the trial is expected to end this year. Contributors such as Stille (Excellent Cadavers), Renate Siebert (Secrets of Life and Death: Women and the Mafia), and Palermo mayor Leoluca Orlando offer enlightening background on the maxi trials, recent Sicilian history, and Battaglia herself.

Not to mention the vacations that had to be planned around the harvest, the near electrocution of the tree man, the limitations of his own middle-aged body, and the pity of his wife and kids. When Alexander runs (just for fun!) a costbenefit analysis, adding up everything from the live animal trap to the Velcro tomato wraps and then amortizing it over the life of his garden, it comes as quite a shock to learn that it cost him a staggering $64 to grow each one of his beloved Brandywine tomatoes. But as any gardener will tell you, you can&#39;t put a price on the unparalleled pleasures of providing fresh food for your family.</p><p>Who knew that Bill Alexander's simple dream of having a vegetable garden and small orchard would lead him into life-and-death battles with webworms, weeds, and a groundhog named Superchuck? Over the course of his hilarious adventures, Alexander puzzles over why a six-thousand-volt wire doesn't deter deer but nearly kills his tree surgeon; encounters a gardener who bears an eerie resemblance to Christopher Walken; and stumbles across the aphrodisiac effects of pollen when he plays bumble bee to his apple blossoms.<br><br> When he decides (just for fun) to calculate how much it cost to grow one of his beloved Brandywine tomatoes, he comes up with a staggering $64. But as any gardener knows, you can't put a price tag on the rewards of homegrown produce, or on the lessons learned along the way.<p>William Alexander, the author of two critically acclaimed books, lives in New York's Hudson Valley. By day the IT director at a research institute, he made his professional writing debut at the age of fifty-three with a national bestseller about gardening, <i>The $64 Tomato.</i> His second book, <i>52 Loaves,</i> chronicled his quest to bake the perfect loaf of bread, a journey that took him to such far-flung places as a communal oven in Morocco and an abbey in France, as well as into his own backyard to grow, thresh, and winnow wheat. The <i>Boston Globe</i> called Alexander "wildly entertaining," the <i>New York Times</i> raved that "his timing and his delivery are flawless," and the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i> observed that "the world would be a less interesting place without the William Alexanders who walk among us." A 2006 Quill Book Awards finalist, Alexander won a Bert Greene Award from the IACP for his article on bread, published in <i>Saveur</i> magazine.

The afternoon sun bore down. She rode sidesaddle and though normally expert, today she could hardly keep her balance. Her hat had vanished and her green riding habit, the height of Parisian fashion, was ripped by brambles and speckled with blood, tawny fair hair streaming in the wind.<br><br>She whipped the pony faster. Now she could see the tiny hovels of the Yokohama fishing village clustering the high fence and canals that enclosed the Foreign Settlement and spires of the two small churches within and knew, thankfully, in the bay beyond were British, French, American and Russian merchantmen and a dozen warships, both steam and sail.<br><br>Faster. Over narrow wooden bridges and canals and irrigation ditches that crisscrossed the paddy and swamps. Her pony was lathered with sweat, a deep wound on his shoulder and tiring rapidly. He shied. A bad moment but she recovered, and now she swerved onto the path that led through the village to the bridge over the encircling canal and to the main gate and the samurai guard house, and Japanese Customs House.<br><br>The two-sworded samurai sentries saw her coming and moved to intercept, but she charged through them into the wide main street of the Settlement proper on the seafront. One of the samurai guards rushed for an officer.<br><br>She reined in, panting. "Au secours... � l'aide, help!"<br><br>The promenade was almost deserted, most of the inhabitants at siesta or yawning in their countinghouses, or dallying in the Pleasure Houses outside the fence.<br><br>"Help!" she called out again and again, and the few men spread along its length, British traders and off-duty soldiers and sailors mostly, some Chinese servants, looked up startled.<br><br>"God Almighty, look there! It's the French girl... "<br><br>"What's amiss? Christ, look at her clothes... "<br><br>"Cor, it's her, the smasher, Angel Tits, arrived couple of weeks ago... "<br><br>"That's right, Angelique... Angelique Beecho or Reecho, some Frog name like that.... "<br><br>"My God, look at the blood!"<br><br>Everyone began converging on her, except the Chinese who, wise after millennia of sudden trouble, vanished. Faces began to appear in windows.<br><br>"Charlie, fetch Sir William on the double!"<br><br>"Christ Almighty, look at her pony, poor bugger will bleed to death, get the vet," a corpulent trader called out. "And you, soldier, quick, get the General, and the Frog, she's his ward&#x2014;oh, for God's sake, the French Minister, hurry!" Impatiently he pointed at a single-story house flying the French flag. "Hurry!" he bellowed. The soldier rushed off, and he trundled for her as fast as he could. Like all traders he wore a top hat and woolen frock coat, tight pants, boots, and sweated in the sun. "What on earth happened, Miss Angelique?" he said, grabbing her bridle, aghast at the dirt and blood that speckled her face and clothes and hair. "Are you hurt?"<br><br>"Moi, non... no, I think not but we were attacked... Japanners attacked us." She was trying to catch her breath and stop shaking, still in terror, and pushed the hair out of her face. Urgently she pointed inland westwards, Mount Fuji vaguely on the horizon. "Back there, quick, they need&#x2014;need help!"<br><br>Those nearby were appalled and noisily began relaying the half news to others and asking questions: Who? Who was attacked? Are they French or British? Attacked? Where? Two-sword bastards again! Where the hell did this happen... ?<br><br>Questions overlaid other questions and gave her no time to answer, nor could she yet, coherently, her chest heaving, everyone pressing closer, crowding her. More and more men poured into the street putting on coats and hats, many already armed with pistols and muskets, a few with the latest American breech-loading rifles. One of these men, a big-shouldered, bearded Scot, ran down the steps of an imposing two-story building. Over the portal was "Struan and Company." He shoved his way through to her in the uproar.<br><br>"Quiet, for God's sake!" he shouted, and in the sudden lull, "Quick, tell us what happened. Where's young Mr. Struan?"<br><br>"Oh, Jamie, je... I&#x2014;I... " The girl made a desperate effort to collect herself, disoriented. "Oh, mon Dieu!"<br><br>He reached up and patted her shoulder like a child, to gentle her, adoring her, like all of them. "Don't worry, you're safe now, Miss Angelique. Take your time. Give her some room, for God's sake!" Jamie McFay was thirty-nine, chief manager of Struan's in Japan. "Now, tell us what happened."<br><br>She brushed away the tears, her tawny hair askew. "We... we were attacked&#x2014;attacked by samurai," she said, her voice tiny and accent pleasing. Everyone craned to hear better. "We were... we were on the... on the big road... " Again she pointed inland. "It was there."<br><br>"The Tokaido?"<br><br>"Yes, that's it, the Tokaido... " This great coastal trunk toll road, a little over a mile west of the Settlement, joined the Shogun's forbidden capital, Yedo, twenty miles northwards, to the rest of Japan, also forbidden to all foreigners. "We were... riding.... " She stopped and then the words poured out: "Mr. Canterbury, and Phillip Tyrer and Malcolm&#x2014;Mr. Struan&#x2014;and me, we were riding along the road and then there were some... a long line of samurai with banners and we wait to let them pass then we... then two of them rush us, they wound Mr. Canterbury, charge Malcolm&#x2014;Mr. Struan&#x2014;who had his pistol out and Phillip who shout me to run away, to get help." The shaking began again. "Quick, they need help!"<br><br>Already men were rushing for mounts, and more guns. Angry shouts began: "Someone get the troops... "<br><br>"Samurai got John Canterbury, Struan, and that young chap Tyrer&#x2014;they've been chopped on the Tokaido."<br><br>"Christ, she says samurai have killed some of our lads!"<br><br>"Where did this happen?" Jamie McFay called out above the noise, curbing his frantic impatience. "Can you describe the place where this happened, exactly where?"<br><br>"By the roadside, before Kana... Kana something."<br><br>"Kanagawa?" he asked, naming a small way station and fishing village on the Tokaido, a mile across the bay, three odd miles by coastal road.<br><br>"Oui&#x2014;yes. Kanagawa! Hurry!"<br><br>Horses were being led out of the Struan stables, saddled and ready. Jamie slung a rifle over his shoulder. "Don't worry, we'll find them quickly. But Mr. Struan? Did you see if he got away&#x2014;if he was hurt?"<br><br>"Non. I saw nothing, just the beginning, poor Mr. Canterbury, he... I was riding beside him when they... " The tears flooded. "I did not look back, I obeyed without... and came to get help."<br><br>Her name was Angelique Richaud. She was just eighteen. This was the first time she had been outside the fence.<br><br>McFay jumped into the saddle and whirled away. Christ Almighty, he thought in anguish, we haven't had any trouble for a year or more, otherwise I'd never have let them go. I'm responsible; Malcolm's heir apparent and I'm responsible! In the Name of God, what the hell happened?<br><br>Without delay, McFay, a dozen or so traders, and a Dragoon officer with three of his lancers found John Canterbury on the side of the Tokaido, but viewing him was more difficult. He was decapitated and parts of his limbs were scattered nearby. Ferocious sword cuts were patterned all over his body, almost any one of which would have been a death blow. There was no sign of Tyrer and Struan, or the column of samurai. None of the passersby knew anything about the murder, who had done it, or when or why.<br><br>"Would the other two have been kidnapped, Jamie?" an American asked queasily.<br><br>"I don't know, Dmitri." McFay tried to get his brain working. "Someone better go back and tell Sir William and get... and bring a shroud or coffin." White-faced, he studied the passing crowds, who carefully did not look in his direction but observed everything.<br><br>The well-kept, beaten earth roadway was massed with disciplined streams of travellers to and from Yedo, which one day would be called Tokyo. Men, women and children of all ages, rich and poor, all Japanese but for an occasional long-gowned Chinese. Predominately men, all wearing kimonos of various styles and modesty, and many different hats of cloth and straw. Merchants, half-naked porters, orange-robed Buddhist priests, farmers going to or coming from market, itinerant soothsayers, scribes, teachers and poets. Many litters and palanquins of all kinds for people or goods with two, four, six or eight bearers. The few strutting samurai amongst the crowds stared at them balefully as they passed.<br><br>"They know who did it, all of them," McFay said.<br><br>"Sure. Matyeryebitz!" Dmitri Syborodin, the American, a heavyset, brown-haired man of thirty-eight, roughly clothed and a friend of Canterbury, was seething. "It'd be goddam easy to force one of them." Then they noticed a dozen or so samurai standing in a group down the road, watching them. Many had bows and all Westerners knew what adept archers samurai were.<br><br>"Not so easy, Dmitri," McFay said.<br><br>Pallidar, the young Dragoon officer, said crisply, "Very easy to deal with them, Mr. McKay, but ill-advised without permission&#x2014;unless of course they attack us. You're quite safe." Settry Pallidar detailed a dragoon to fetch a detachment from the camp, with a coffin, the American visibly irritated by his imperiousness. "You'd better search the nearby countryside. When my men arrive they'll assist. More than likely the other two are wounded somewhere."<br>McFay shuddered, motioned at the corpse. "Or like him?"<br><br>"Possibly, but let's hope for the best. You three take that side, the rest of you spread out and&#x2014;"<br><br>"Hey, Jamie," Dmitri interrupted deliberately, hating officers and uniforms and soldiers, particularly British ones. "How about you and me going on to Kanagawa&#x2014;maybe someone in our Legation knows something."<br><br>Pallidar disregarded the hostility, understanding it, well acquainted with the American's fine service record. Dmitri was an American of Cossack extraction, an ex-cavalry officer of the U.S. Army, whose grandfather had been killed fighting the British in the American War of 1812. "Kanagawa is a good idea, Mr. McFay," he said. "They should certainly know what big procession of samurai passed through and the sooner we find out who the culprit is the better. The attack must have been ordered by one of their kings or princes. This time we can peg the bastard and God help him."<br><br>"God rot all bastards," Dmitri said pointedly.<br><br>Again the resplendently uniformed Captain did not provoke but did not let it pass. "Quite right, Mr. Syborodin," he said easily. "And any man who calls me a bastard better quickly get himself a second, a pistol or sword, a shroud and someone to bury him. Mr. McFay, you'll have plenty of time before sunset. I'll stay here until my men return, then we'll join the search. If you hear anything in Kanagawa, please send me word." He was twenty-four and worshipped his regiment. With barely concealed disdain he looked at the motley group of traders. "I suggest the rest of you... gentlemen... begin the search, spread out but stay in visual contact. Brown, you go with that group and search those woods. Sergeant, you're in charge."<br><br>"Yessir. Come on, you lot."<br><br>McFay took off his coat and spread it over the body, then remounted. With his American friend he hurried northwards toward Kanagawa, a mile away.<br><br>Now the dragoon was alone. Coldly he sat on his horse near the corpse and watched the samurai. They stared back. One moved his bow, perhaps a threat, perhaps not. Pallidar remained motionless, his sabre loose in its scabbard. Sunlight sparked off his gold braid. Pedestrians on the Tokaido hurried by silently, afraid. His horse pawed the ground nervously, jingling the harness.<br><br>This isn't like the other attacks, the lone attacks, he thought with growing anger. There's going to be hell to pay, attacking those four, a woman amongst them, and killing an Englishman so foully. This means war.<br><br>A few hours ago the four of them had ridden out of the main gate, past the Customs House, casually saluted the samurai guards who bowed perfunctorily, and trotted leisurely inland along meandering paths, heading for the Tokaido. All were expert riders, their ponies nimble.<br><br>In Angelique's honor, they wore their best top hats and riding clothes, and were the envy of every man in the Settlement: one hundred and seventeen resident Europeans, diplomats, traders, butchers, shopkeepers, blacksmiths, shipwrights, armorers, adventurers, gamblers and many ne'er-do-wells and remittance men, most of them British, the clerks Eurasian or Chinese, a few Americans, French, Dutch, Germans, Russians, Australians and one Swiss; and amongst them three women, all matrons, two British, wives of traders, the last a madam in Drunk Town, as the low-class quarter was called. No children. Fifty to sixty Chinese servants.<br><br>John Canterbury, a good-looking, craggy-faced British trader acted as their guide. The purpose of the excursion was to show Phillip Tyrer the way by land to Kanagawa, where meetings with Japanese officials took place from time to time; it was well within the agreed Settlement area. Tyrer, just twenty-one, had arrived yesterday from London via Peking and Shanghai, a newly appointed student interpreter to the British Legation.<br><br>This morning, overhearing the two of them in the Club, Malcolm Struan had said, "May I come along, Mr. Canterbury, Mr. Tyrer? It's a perfect day for sightseeing; I'd like to ask Miss Richaud to join us&#x2014;she hasn't seen any of the country yet."<br><br>"We'd be honored, Mr. Struan." Canterbury was blessing his luck. "You're both welcome. The ride's good though there's not much to see&#x2014;for a lady."<br><br>"Eh?" Tyrer had said.<br><br>"Kanagawa's been a busy post village and stopover place for travellers to and from Yedo for centuries, so we're told. It's well stocked with Teahouses, that's what most brothels are called here. Some of them are well worth a visit, though we're not always welcome like at our own Yoshiwara across the swamp."<br><br>"Whorehouses?" Tyrer had said.<br><br>The other two had laughed at his look. "The very same, Mr. Tyrer," Canterbury had said. "But they're not like the doss houses or brothels in London, or anywhere else in the world; they're special. You'll soon find out, though here the custom is to have your own doxy, if you can afford it."<br><br>"I'll never be able to do that," Tyrer said.<br><br>Canterbury laughed. "Maybe you will. Thank God the rate of exchange favors us, oh my word! That old Yankee Townsend Harris was a canny bastard." He beamed at the thought. Harris was the first American Consul-General appointed two years after Commodore Perry had forced the opening of Japan to the outside world, first in '53, then '56 with his four Black Ships&#x2014;the first steamers seen in Japanese waters. Four years ago, after years of negotiating, Harris arranged Treaties later ratified by major Powers that granted access to certain ports. The Treaties also fixed a very favorable rate of exchange between silver Mex&#x2014;Mexican silver dollars, the universal coin of exchange and trade in Asia&#x2014;and Japanese gold oban, whereby if you changed Mex for oban and later exchanged them for Mex, you could double or triple your money.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The World&#39;s First Love</h2><p>Fulton J.

Here it is set in the frame of a grandmother regaling her three granddaughters on a rainy afternoon with a tale from her childhood. On the evening of the Moon Festival, she is separated from her family, and goes through several fascinating and scary adventures until she is finally reunited with them. Tan has a good tale here, and she retells it well for children: while the story is in progress, it is told from the child's point of view; at beginning and ending frames, the grandmother's voice is used. The illustrations are an integral part of this version and can best be described as phantasmagorical or Chinese baroque. They are extremely detailed, providing both accurate cultural detail of the period (the tale is set somewhere in the two decades after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, i.e., the 1920s or '30s) and a child's romantic imaginings. Primary colors reign in the 12 sumptuous full-page pictures, as well as in the smaller vignettes that pepper and punctuate the narrative. A successful collaboration of compelling text and absorbing illustrations that will make young readers crave more. --John Philbrook, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.On a rainy afternoon, a woman shares with three restless granddaughters her "earliest memory" from her childhood in China. Adapted from Tan's The Joy Luck Club , the haunting tale that unfolds is worthy of retelling--and of repeated rereading. The narrator, Ying-ying, recalls waking up at the age of seven on the morning of the Moon Festival; it was a steamy day, and "the sun drove rays through the bamboo curtains like knives." Filled with similarly vivid images, Tan's lilting text conveys Ying-ying's contagious excitement about the festivities. These include the appearance of the Moon Lady, who can fulfill one's secret wish. Later, celebrating with her family on a "floating teahouse," Ying-ying loses her balance and falls into the lake, where she is caught in a fisherman's net. He returns her to shore, where her secret wish is granted: she is found by her family, and thus learns a lesson about which kind of wishes come true. Tan has done a superb job of distilling this incident for young readers, who will be as mesmerized by the expressive narrative as by Schields's ornately detailed paintings, ablaze with luminous color.

His book appears in the fifth year of a lackluster recovery from the overmedicated downturn of 2007&#x2013;2009.<br> <br>In 1920&#x2013;21, Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding met a deep economic slump by seeming to ignore it, implementing policies that most twenty-first century economists would call backward. Confronted with plunging prices, wages, and employment, the government balanced the budget and, through the Federal Reserve, raised interest rates. No &#x201c;stimulus&#x201d; was administered, and a powerful, job-filled recovery was under way by late in 1921. <br> <br>In 1929, the economy once again slumped&#x2014;and kept right on slumping as the Hoover administration adopted the very policies that Wilson and Harding had declined to put in place. Grant argues that well-intended federal intervention, notably the White House-led campaign to prop up industrial wages, helped to turn a bad recession into America&#x2019;s worst depression. He offers the experience of the earlier depression for lessons for today and the future. This is a powerful response to the prevailing notion of how to fight recession. The enterprise system is more resilient than even its friends give it credit for being, Grant demonstrates.</p><p>James Grant is the founder of <i>Grant&#x2019;s Interest Rate Observer</i>, a leading journal on financial markets, which he has published since 1983. He is the author of seven books covering both financial history and biography. Grant&#x2019;s journalism has been featured in <i>Financial Times</i>,<i> The Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Foreign </i>Affairs. He has appeared on <i>60 Minutes</i>,<i> Jim Lehrer&#x2019;s News Hour</i>, and <i>CBS Evening News.</i>The Forgotten Depression 1 <p></p> THE GREAT INFLATION<p></p> <br>The coda to the murderous Great War of 1914&#x2013;18 was an influenza pandemic even more lethal than the war itself. But the wounded world of 1919 could count one saving grace, at least. The oft-predicted postwar depression had failed to materialize. Quite the contrary: Business was booming.<br> <br>Here was a most pleasant anomaly. History taught that peace would bring depression. Such had been the experience of America after both the War of 1812 and the Civil War. The Great War was a world war. No doubt, many reasoned, a worldwide economic adjustment would prove even more disruptive than the slumps that had followed more isolated conflicts of the past.<br> <br>No template for government action to resist depressions was yet in place. Long-established economic doctrine rather favored laissez-faire. As the natural seasons turned, so did the economic ones: summer and winter, boom and bust. Individuals might prepare for the inevitable lurches to the down side&#x2014;a workman might save, a farmer might market his crops in anticipation of lower prices, a banker might call in loans to brace for a depositors&#x2019; run. But from the government, not much was expected but to balance its budget, maintain a sound currency and allow business to take its natural, improving course. &#x201c;[T]hough the people support the government, the government should not support the people,&#x201d; declared President Grover Cleveland in vetoing a $10,000 appropriation to pay for the distribution of seed grain to drought-stricken Texas farmers in 1887.1<br> <br>It was the letter of the Cleveland doctrine rather than the spirit that still prevailed in some policy-making circles. Many voices now pressed the government to intervene. &#x201c;Progressive,&#x201d; the speakers styled themselves, though the progress to which they aspired concerned not the management of the business cycle but redressing the supposed injustice in the distribution of income. By 1892, the Populist Party was demanding inflation of the currency, a graduated income tax, strict limitations on corporate ownership of land and the nationalization of the railroads and telephone and telegraph companies.2 By 1908, Eugene Debs was demanding a republic in which the working class governed the plutocracy, rather than the other way around. By 1910, Theodore Roosevelt, no avowed socialist, was demanding that &#x201c;human welfare&#x201d; be raised above &#x201c;property.&#x201d;3<br> <br>&#x201c;From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes&#x2014;tramps and millionaires,&#x201d; the Populists had alleged. Certainly, electrical illumination, the internal combustion engine and related marvels lightened the burden of labor and thereby liberated many from drudgery and want. But, equally, according to the composite Progressive indictment, the rich had never been richer, nor the gap between rich and poor provokingly wider.4<br> <br>In the 1912 presidential election, Debs drew 6 percent of the popular vote on the Socialist ticket, the best showing by any left-wing candidate in any presidential contest before or since.5 He finished fourth.<br> <br>William Howard Taft, the 300-odd-pound Republican incumbent, campaigning on the doctrine that &#x201c;[a] National Government cannot create good times&#x201d; (but could, through ill-advised policy, institute bad times), won a mere two states, Utah and Vermont.6 He came in third.<br> <br>Theodore Roosevelt, who had bolted from the GOP to preach that government could, in fact, effect the very improvements that Taft resisted, pledged to &#x201c;use the whole power of government&#x201d; to resist &#x201c;an unregulated and purely individualistic industrialism.&#x201d;7 He placed second.<br> <br>Candidate Wilson vowed to tame the &#x201c;trusts,&#x201d; rein in the big Wall Street banks, lower tariffs and&#x2014;to compensate for lost revenue from reduced import duties&#x2014;tax the rich. President Wilson, having beaten the divided GOP, proved as good as his word. By the close of his first year in office, the former president of Princeton University had presented the nation with an income tax and a central bank (in name, a kind of decentralized central bank). The federal government would never again lack the means of financing itself.<br> <br>In 1916, at the end of his first term, Wilson sought a second. He was deserving on financial grounds alone, the Democratic Party platform asserted: &#x201c;Our archaic banking and currency system, prolific of panic and disaster under Republican administrations&#x2014;long the refuge of the money trust&#x2014;has been supplanted by the Federal Reserve Act, a true democracy of credit under government control, already proved a bulwark in a world crisis, mobilizing our resources, placing abundant credit at the disposal of legitimate industry and making a currency panic impossible.&#x201d; Then, too, the Democrats commended themselves for &#x201c;the splendid diplomatic victories of our great president, who has preserved the vital interests of our government and its citizens and kept us out of war.&#x201d;<br> <br>New vistas of federal activism opened on April 6, 1917, when the president led the nation into war. As Washington drafted men, so it conscripted incomes. In House debate in 1913 over the proposed income tax, a seemingly wild-eyed Progressive had called for a schedule of rates culminating in 68 percent on incomes above $1 million. &#x201c;The amendment was, of course, beaten,&#x201d; reported the New York Times, the paper seeming to roll its eyes at the very notion of so confiscatory a marginal rate of taxation.8 By 1918, the Treasury was taking 77 percent of incomes above $1 million.9 The Wilson administration took control of merchant shipping, the railroads and the telegraph and telephone companies. It rationed raw materials and set ceilings on prices and wages. It intervened in labor disputes. It allocated, requisitioned and commandeered private property. It liberalized the banking rules and thereby encouraged the expansion of credit: After June 1917, a New York bank could lend 38.8 percent more against every dollar of reserve it was required to hold than before the change was enacted.10 Woodrow Wilson delivered the activist government that America&#x2019;s populists and socialists had long demanded.11<br> <br>So when Frank Morrison, secretary of the American Federation of Labor, warned in January 1919 that the government was the only instrument of postwar economic salvation&#x2014;and that, barring federal intervention, there could be &#x201c;bread lines in every industrial center before May 1&#x201d;&#x2014;his message had none of the shock value it would have had before the war.12 More conventionally familiar was the fatalistic voice of the Babson economic forecasting service, which predicted &#x201c;a period of trouble and depression.&#x201d; There was no getting around it, said the founder, Roger W. Babson: &#x201c;We can prepare for reaction and prevent it from being disastrous, but to stop it is impossible.&#x201d;<br> <br>Right as rain did the bears initially appear to be. Within four weeks of the November 11, 1918, Armistice, the War Department had cancelled $2.5 billion of its then outstanding $6 billion in manufacturing contracts;13 for perspective, $2.5 billion represented 3.3 percent of the 1918 gross national product.14 In January 1919 commodity prices tumbled. Steel mills, which had hardly been able to keep up with war-induced demand, now operated at 60 percent to 65 percent of capacity. Order books dwindled, that of the United States Steel Corporation by 42 percent between the Armistice and May 1919. Not since the Panic of 1907 had the giant steel maker seen the likes of it.15<br> <br>But the Morrisons and Babsons had failed to reckon with the long-thwarted American consumer. Purchases patriotically deferred during the year and a half of U.S. belligerency were now exuberantly rung up. War or not, Americans had continued to drive their Fords and Chevrolets and Buicks (gasoline sales never wavered during the ostensibly luxury-free duration of the conflict). Now, with the peace, the people demanded silk shirts, new cars and a little fun.<br> <br>European consumers, too, were buying American, their spending power enhanced by loans funneled through their governments from the U.S. Treasury. In the five years prior to the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914, American exports had averaged $2.1 billion a year. They accelerated during the war and soared again with the peace. In 1919, they reached nearly $8 billion.16<br> <br>Doomsayers could hardly believe their eyes. Surely, they reasoned, a postwar boom was a contradiction in terms. What was needed&#x2014;and what was, on form, inevitable&#x2014;was a bust. As with physical objects, so with prices: What goes up would have to come down. Consumer prices had risen by 11 percent in 1916, by 17 percent in 1917 and by 18.6 percent in 1918. They were on their way to rising by 13.8 percent in 1919.17<br> <br>Flyaway prices were symptoms of wartime financial disorder. Immense public borrowing, and the easy money to accommodate it, may or may not have been a necessary evil, but the Armistice now rendered it unnecessary. When governments stopped printing money for the very purpose of destroying life and property&#x2014;when production and orthodox banking made their welcome reappearance&#x2014;come this happy day, the experts promised, prices would certainly tumble.<br> <br>But prices resumed their rise as the experts reconsidered their forecasts. In early May, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle was prepared to admit to its Wall Street readership that &#x201c;merchants are less timid about buying.&#x201d; Before very long, the merchants were buying boldly. By the fall of 1919, plants were operating at full capacity, raw materials were unobtainable except at exorbitant prices and delivery dates were being pushed out by as much as a year.18 Come Christmas, the Chronicle&#x2019;s columns were reporting that &#x201c;consumption plainly outruns production; in parts of the country what might be called a Saturnalia of buying prevails; the retail holiday business is said to be the largest on record.&#x201d;19<br> <br>If Saturnalia it was, the inflationary boom of 1919 was a bitter and unhappy one. Wages couldn&#x2019;t seem to keep pace with prices, nor prices with costs. A pair of sensible shoes had cost $3 before the war. Now they sold for $10 or $12. Bankers scornfully spoke of the shrunken &#x201c;fifty-cent dollar.&#x201d;20 Pensioners, judges, professors&#x2014;anyone on a fixed income&#x2014;suffered a crippling loss in living standards. Class rose up against class and interest group against interest group.<br> <br>Especially did the great inflation set labor against management, city dwellers against farmers, creditors against debtors and the Federal Reserve against a growing legion of monetary critics. The &#x201c;high cost of living&#x201d;&#x2014;or the more headline-suitable acronym &#x201c;H.C.L.&#x201d;&#x2014;became the national hot button. And hovering in the background of these economic conflicts was the outbreak of revolution in Europe and the triumph of Communism in Russia. Was America next in line for a workers&#x2019; revolt? &#x201c;We are going to socialize the basic industries of the United States,&#x201d; vowed John Fitzpatrick, veteran president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, on September 18, 1919.21<br> <br>Labor took out its anger on management, which not infrequently responded with allegations that the unions were stalking horses for the violent left. In 1919, one in five American workers was involved in a strike; it was an unprecedented figure at the time, and it has never been approached since.22 The United Mine Workers, the nation&#x2019;s biggest union, struck the coal mines, and a quarter million steelworkers walked out on U.S. Steel. There was a police strike in Boston. There were strikes by machinists, iron workers, upholsterers, butchers, paper makers, boot and shoe workers, raincoat makers, oilfield hands, longshoremen, puddlers, metal polishers, carmen, waiters, garment workers, die sinkers, grain handlers, livestock handlers, silk weavers, petticoat workers, silk operatives, drop-forge men, painters, glaziers, braziers, tool makers, cigar makers, subway workers, actors, carpenters and pressmen.23 In September 1919, President Wilson, setting off on his ill-fated cross-country trip to take his case for the League of Nations directly to the people, stopped in Columbus to deliver his first speech. The crowd was disappointingly small&#x2014;it seemed that the Columbus trolleymen had struck.24<br> <br>Many were the local and particular grievances that pushed workers and managements to break off negotiations and mount (or suffer) a strike. One common thread was the workers&#x2019; loss of real income to sky-high prices. Another was radical politics.<br> <br>The Bolshevik triumph in Russia in November 1917 electrified the American left. Here was the sign they had so long awaited. A general strike&#x2014;the first in American history&#x2014;shuttered Seattle for five days in January 1919. Yes, the Reds and anarchists and members of the Industrial Workers of the World&#x2014;better known as Wobblies&#x2014;were bound to admit, the reactionaries had cut short the people&#x2019;s uprising. But what an inspiring revolt it had been.25<br> <br>Still inspired, the would-be vanguard of the socialist revolution marked May Day with the mailing of 30 letter bombs to members of the American Establishment. Lacking adequate postage, most of the bombs went undelivered. Reinspired, or refinanced, the revolutionaries tried again.26 Among their targets was Wilson&#x2019;s energetic and ambitious attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer.<br> <br>Late on the night of June 2, an assailant dropped a bomb near the front door of Palmer&#x2019;s Washington, D.C., home. The device blew the would-be executioner to bits&#x2014;he seemed to have tripped before he reached his target&#x2014;but left Mr. and Mrs. Palmer physically unharmed. &#x201c;Class war is on and cannot cease but with a complete victory for the international proletariat&#x201d; was an excerpt from the dozens of copies of the anarchist pamphlet &#x201c;Plain Words&#x201d; that the bomber had not had the chance to distribute.27<br> <br>Such acts of domestic violence did nothing to sweeten the relations between management and labor. Angry and fearful men glowered on either side of the bargaining table. &#x201c;It might be that before we got through we would bring ...</p><h2>Sunbonnet Sue Visits Quilt in a Day (Quilt in a Day Series)</h2><p>The universal appeal of children busy at work and at play was captured by the illustrator Kate Greenaway at the turn of the century.

Never read a Discworld book? The closest comparison might be <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, with its uniquely British sense of the absurd, and side-splitting, smart humor. <i>Jingo</i> is the 20th of Pratchett's Discworld novels, and the fourth to feature the City Guard of Ankh-Morpork. As <i>Jingo</i> begins, an island suddenly rises between Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali, capital of Klatch. Both cities claim it. Lord Vetinari, the Patrician, has failed to convince the Ruling Council that force is a bad idea, despite reminding them that they have no army, and "I believe one of those is generally considered vital to the successful prosecution of a war." Samuel Vimes, Commander of the City Watch, has to find out who shot the Klatchian envoy, Prince Khufurah, and set fire to their embassy, before war breaks out. <p> Pratchett's characters are both sympathetic and outrageously entertaining, from Captain Carrot, who always finds the best in people and puts it to work playing football, to Sergeant Colon and his sidekick, Corporal Nobbs, who have "an ability to get out of their depth on a wet pavement." Then there is the mysterious D'reg, 71-hour Ahmed. What is his part in all this, and why 71 hours? Anyone who doesn't mind laughing themselves silly at the idiocy of people in general and governments in particular will enjoy <i>Jingo</i>. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Something new has come up between the Discworld&#39;s ancient rival cities of Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali. Literally. It&#39;s an island, rising out of Discworld&#39;s sea, uninhabited and claimed by both cities. Ankh-Morpork has been at peace for a century, and so has Al-Khali. But now there are people on both sides who think it&#39;s time to give war a chance, and will happily help it on its way with a few murders... Modern war needs modern weapons. Unfortunately, Ankh-Morpork got rich making and selling them to Al-Khali. But it&#39;s just possible that salvation lies in the hands of the great inventive genius Leonard of Quirm, whose sketchbooks are filled with devices for killing people, flying through the air, and weighing cheese.</p><h2>Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical Meaning of History</h2><p>A reevaluation of psychoanalytic theory, based on a Freudian interpretation of the history of Western civilization</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim.

Fueled by outrage at the punitive terms of the Versailles Treaty that ended the Great War, he found his voice and drew a following.<br> <br>As his views developed, Hitler attracted like-minded colleagues who formed the nucleus of the nascent Nazi party. The failed Munich <i>putsch</i> of 1923 and subsequent trial gave Hitler a platform for his views, which he skillfully exploited. Between 1924 and 1929 Hitler and his party languished in obscurity on the radical fringes of German politics, but the onset of the Great Depression provided Hitler the issues he needed to move into the mainstream of German political life. He seized the opportunity to blame Germany&#x2019;s misery on the victorious allies, the Marxists, the Jews, and big business&#x2014;and the political parties that represented them. By 1932 the Nazis had become the largest political party in Germany. Although Hitler became chancellor in 1933, his party had never achieved a majority in free elections. Within six months the Nazis transformed a dysfunctional democracy into a totalitarian state and began the inexorable march to World War II and the Holocaust.<br> <br>It is these fraught times that Childers brings to life: the Nazis&#x2019; rise to power and their use and abuse of power once they achieved it. Based in part on German documents seldom used by previous historians, <i>The Third Reich</i> charts the dramatic, improbable rise of the Nazis; the suffering of ordinary Germans under Nazi rule; and the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust. This is the most comprehensive and readable one-volume history of Nazi Germany since the classic <i>Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. </i></p><p>Thomas Childers was formerly the Sheldon and Lucy Hackney Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania and the recipient of numerous fellowships and awards.

He had left the prison for his trial an ob-<br>scure street corner agitator whose notoriety was confined largely to Ba- varia. When he returned, he was the &#x201c;martyr of Munich,&#x201d; a hero of the radical right. The disastrous Putsch had been ridiculed everywhere as a bumbling, almost farcical calamity, but Hitler&#x2019;s virtuoso performance in the courtroom had transformed him into a national figure. Now he was Landsberg&#x2019;s &#x201c;prisoner of honor,&#x201d; a celebrity to the other conspirators, the jailers, and the prison officials.<br> In the wing of Landsberg Prison reserved for political prisoners&#x2014;a com- modity with which Bavaria, given its turbulent postwar history, was well stocked&#x2014;Hitler was again assigned cell 7 on the upper floor, reserved for the most important prisoners. His cell was small but comfortable, holding a table, two chairs, a cupboard, and bed. Light poured in from two large windows, and although Hitler complained about the bars, his view was of shrubbery, trees, and hills. Visitors brought geraniums and other fl wers.<br> Under the circumstances, he had all he could ask for. He dressed in his own clothes, usually lederhosen and the traditional Tyrolean jacket, white shirt, and sometimes a tie. Telegrams and letters from loyal party mem- bers and doting admirers poured into the prison; some sent books, others packages of food (Hitler was partial to Viennese pastries and fretted about his weight). Hitler&#x2019;s cell, Putzi Hanfstaengl later remarked, &#x201c;looked like a delicatessen. You could have opened up a flower and fruit and a wine shop with all the stuff stacked in there.&#x201d;<br><br>Although visitors were to be restricted, the sympathetic prison authorities turned a blind eye to the rising tide of visitors who arrived for an audi- ence with &#x201c;the hero of Munich.&#x201d; On some days Hitler spent up to six hours receiving guests. Even his dog was allowed a visit. By summer Hitler was be- sieged by so many visitors that he asked the jailers to admit only those with a written appointment. The prisoners were granted two hour-long sessions of physical exercise, including boxing and gymnastics. Hitler sometimes ref- ereed the contests but usually preferred to walk&#x2014;after all, the leader of the movement could hardly enter into a physical competition with his followers.<br> Even as a prisoner, Hitler was very much in command, the master of his surroundings. When a new prisoner was assigned to the block, he was taken immediately to report to Hitler. At meals in the common room Hitler presided over the table, holding court. One fellow conspirator wrote to a friend that every day at 10 a.m. &#x201c;there is normally an hour&#x2019;s discus- sion with the Chief or better still an address by the Chief.&#x201d; The jailers and other prison staff often listened from beyond the doorway, and were as impressed as the prisoners. When Hitler spoke, &#x201c;the warders gathered outside on the staircase and listened without making a sound . . . the men of the police guard unit would form up in the courtyard outside and none of these listeners ever made even the smallest disturbance.&#x201d;<br> Hitler&#x2019;s main occupation while at Landsberg was writing. He had in mind to write a book about his wartime experiences, his political awak- ening, and the beginnings of the NSDAP. A second volume might be nec- essary to explain National Socialism&#x2019;s <i>Weltanschauung</i>, its ideological goals and assumptions. Together the two volumes would constitute an autobiographical political manifesto. Visitors supplied him with paper, pen, and ink, even a typewriter, on which he tapped out the pages, using the two finger method. Sometimes he dictated to fellow conspirators Emil Maurice or Rudolf Hess. One jailer remarked that &#x201c;all day long and late into the night the typewriter would be tapping and one could hear Hitler in his small room dictating to his friend Hess. On Saturday evenings he would generally read the completed sections to his fellow prisoners who sat around him like schoolboys.&#x201d;<br> Hitler was not altogether unhappy with this respite from the frenetic rough and tumble of politics. Since his entry into the party, he had found little time to reflect and write. His considerable energies had been de- voted to speaking, organizing, and attempting to hold the rambunctious NSDAP together. Now, with the enforced discipline and quiet of prison, he could turn at last to developing his ideas in a more systematic form. As he would recall many years later, his book would never have been written had it not been for his time in prison. In Landsberg, with few diversions, he threw himself into his writing. He had high hopes for the book. He intended to call it <i>F</i><i>o</i><i>ur</i><i>and</i><i>a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies, Corruption, and Cowardice</i>, but was dissuaded by his old army comrade and publisher Max Amann, who gingerly suggested that the title might not be as compelling to potential readers as it was to Hitler. Amann suggested a shorter, pithier title: <i>Mein</i><i>K</i><i>amp</i><i>f</i> (<i>My Struggle</i>).<br> Although Hitler was kept informed about developments beyond the prison walls, he refused to become involved in the incessant wrangling among his lieutenants. While awaiting trial, he had deputized Alfred Rosen- berg, the editor of the <i>V�lk</i><i>isc</i><i>h</i><i>er</i><i>B</i><i>eobachter</i>, to act as caretaker for the party in his absence. It was a curious choice. Pedantic, aloof, and bereft of any personal charisma, Rosenberg liked to think of himself as the philos- opher of the party. He had no administrative experience and no personal following. Many believed that Hitler had chosen him for precisely these reasons. Rosenberg was in no danger of usurping his power, nor would he be a threat to his position as leader when he returned.<br> Almost immediately Rosenberg encountered challenges on several fronts. Little had been done to prepare for the possibility that the coup might fail, and Rosenberg discovered that the party&#x2019;s organization was in almost hopeless disarray. Hoping to establish a caretaker organization for the banned NSDAP, he founded the Greater German People&#x2019;s Community (Grossdeutsche Volksgemeinschaft or GVG) on January 1, 1924, but few party leaders were ready to accept him as leader. Many Hitler loyalists remained aloof, and by summer Esser and Streicher had assumed control of the GVG. Other Nazi leaders attached themselves to a rival radical party, the German <i>V�lkisch </i>Freedom Party (DVFP), headquartered in Berlin and headed by Ludendorff and Albrecht von Graefe, who had marched in the failed Putsch. What was left of the NSDAP was fragmenting by the day, splintering into mutually mistrustful factions.<br><br>Complicating matters further, the Nazis were confronted by the approach of the first national elections since 1920. Hitler had always vehemently opposed participation in democratic elections, but the situation in early 1924 seemed to offer rich possibilities. Between November 1923 and the spring of 1924 the Reich government, using emergency decree powers provided by Article 48 of the Weimar constitution, introduced a series of stringent deflationary measures that led to an immediate stabilization of the economy but also had serious social and political ramifications. They entailed the de facto suspension of the eight-hour workday, a massive and unprecedented dismissal of civil servants and public employees, a severe restriction of credit, which produced a flood of bankruptcies, especially by small businesses, and a startling rise in unemployment, most striking among white-collar personnel. In addition, the government&#x2019;s Third Emergency Tax Decree, which revalued debts and mortgages at only 15 percent of their original value, triggered a volcanic eruption of protest from creditors. The inflation crisis of 1923 quickly gave way to the stabilization crisis of 1924.<br> Contributing to the furor raised by the government&#x2019;s harsh stabilization measures was the revival of the reparations issue. The question&#x2014;how much, in what form, and on what schedule Germany would pay&#x2014;had not been set- tled at Versailles or at subsequent international conferences. It would prove to be the most intractable issue in postwar international politics. In early 1924, an international committee of economic experts, appointed by the League of Nations&#x2019; Reparations Commission and chaired by the American banker Charles Dawes, drafted a new scheme of payment to be presented to the German government. In early April, with the Reichstag campaign just getting under way, the committee presented its report to the commission. Quickly dubbed the Dawes Plan, this bundle of recommendations called for a graduated schedule of payments, beginning with approximately one billion marks in 1925&#x2013;26 and rising to a normal annual payment of 2.5 billion by 1928&#x2013;29. To Berlin&#x2019;s dismay, it did not, however, establish Ger- many&#x2019;s total liability, and hence the ominous prospect of paying and paying endlessly into the future loomed over the negotiations.<br> Among the most galling aspects of the plan were provisions that were widely viewed as infringements on Germany&#x2019;s sovereignty. The plan called for the creation of an international general council with broad powers to oversee the German economy. Since a stable currency and a balanced budget were viewed as prerequisites for German recovery, the operations of the German central bank (Reichsbank) were to be closely supervised by the international general council, and an Allied reparations agent was to be stationed in Berlin to direct the transfer of reparations payments. As sweeteners, the committee indicated that acceptance of the Dawes Plan and a good-faith effort to put Germany&#x2019;s economic house in order would prompt a much needed influx of foreign capital that would allow the coun- try to get back on its feet again. Although not formally part of the plan, the Allies also suggested that evacuation of the Ruhr within one year could be expected if the Germans cooperated and accepted the report.<br> As soon as the details of the Dawes Plan&#x2014;and its positive reception by the German government&#x2014;were made public, a nationwide furor erupted. The Conservatives, Nazis, and <i>V�lk</i><i>isc</i><i>h</i> parties as well as the Communists denounced the plan as a &#x201c;second Versailles,&#x201d; another link in the chains of slavery imposed on Germany by the vindictive Allied governments. Al- though the press referred to it as the &#x201c;inflation election,&#x201d; the government&#x2019;s harsh stabilization policies and the Dawes Plan quickly became the central issues of the ensuing campaign, galvanizing all the enemies of the Republic.<br> With the election scheduled for May 4, the Nazis would have to make a decision on whether to participate&#x2014;and quickly. It was a highly contentious issue. Held in the shadow of the hyperinflation and the draconian stabilization that followed, the spring campaign of 1924 seemed to offer anti-Republican forces a tremendous launching pad. Anger over the destruction of the currency and the severe measures undertaken to stabilize the economy&#x2014;all unpopular and all by emergency decree&#x2014;was running high. At the same time, the extensive media coverage of the Hitler trial had thrown a spotlight on the National Socialists just as the campaign was getting under way, and although Hitler was no longer on the scene, many within the party believed that the moment should not be wasted.<br> The foremost advocate of this position was Gregor Strasser, a thirty- two-year-old druggist who in 1924 emerged as one of the most energetic and influential leaders of the NSDAP. Like Hitler, Strasser was a decorated war veteran, a militant nationalist, and an anti-Semite. After four years in the trenches, he returned home to Bavaria, finished his degree in pharmacology at Erlangen, and began a career as an apothecary. In 1919 he signed on with Franz Ritter von Epp&#x2019;s Free Corps to overthrow the Bavarian Socialist Republic; two years later he joined Hitler&#x2019;s fledgling party. Big, gruff in appearance, Strasser had a commanding personality, boundless energy, and a talent for organization. He founded an SA unit in Landshut, acted as SA chief for all of Lower Bavaria, and worked assiduously to establish party chapters in other Bavarian towns. A former army officer, a man of action, he also enjoyed reading Homer in the original classical Greek. Strasser had participated in the Putsch but was cast in a minor role. A few days later he was arrested, charged not for his minimal participation in the coup but with attempting to recruit a soldier for the now-outlawed NSDAP. His stay in prison was brief; he was released in late April 1924 after he was elected to the Bavarian state legislature, a reflection of his burgeoning regional stature.<br> Strasser was convinced that the party should dive into the Reichstag campaign, even if it meant an alliance with other parties, and he vigorously championed a coalition with the German <i>V�lkisch </i>Freedom Party (DVFP). This might be a short-term accommodation, Strasser acknowledged, but he hoped to exploit the DVFP&#x2019;s connections in northern Germany to expand Nazi influence beyond Bavaria. His plans met stiff resistance from Esser and Streicher, leaders of the Bavarian clique that dominated party headquarters in Munich. Despite their considerable personal liabilities, both were longtime party men. They were slavishly devoted to Hitler, who returned their loyalty and trust in equal measure. Both rejected even a temporary alliance with the DVFP and scorned Strasser&#x2019;s efforts to thrust the NSDAP into electoral politics. Didn&#x2019;t he understand that Hitler had always rejected collaboration with other parties and had opposed on prin- ciple any participation in Weimar&#x2019;s corrupt parliamentary system?<br> In spite of these rancorous disagreements within the Nazi camp&#x2014;or perhaps because of them&#x2014;Graefe and Ludendorff relentlessly pressed the case for a joint Nazi-<i>V�lkisch </i>venture. They saw in Hitler&#x2019;s absence an opportunity to assume the leadership of the entire <i>V�lk</i><i>isch</i> movement and score a major electoral victory. With Strasser&#x2019;s support, Graefe began negotiations with Rosenberg and other Nazi leaders for an amalgamation of the two organizations. At a January meeting in Salzburg, Rosenberg refused to accept a merger but did agree to the formation of a temporary electoral alliance. The DVFP would focus primarily (but not exclusively) on the north, the Nazis on the south&#x2014;and policy would be determined by consultation between the leadership of the two parties. It would be the Nazis&#x2019; first election campaign.<br> Although the Nazis had to operate under the banner of the DVFP, the spring campaign displayed all the basic themes of National Social- ist ideology. Denouncing class struggle, the Nazis were determined to break down social barriers and establish a &#x201c;genuine people&#x2019;s community&#x201d; (<i>Volksgemeinschaft</i>) that would bridge the deep divides of German so- ciety. The &#x201c;ultimate cause&#x201d; of Germany&#x2019;s collapse in 1918 lay precisely in this &#x201c;hate-filled divisiveness,&#x201d; which had been &#x201c;systematically fostered by Jewish Marxism.&#x201d; After having driven the kings from their thrones in 1918, the workers now confronted the &#x201c;kings of finance.&#x201d; &#x201c;International bank and stock-market...</p><h2>The Will to Battle: Book 3 of Terra Ignota (Terra Ignota, 3)</h2><p><p><b><i>The Will to Battle</i></b>&#x2015;<b>the third book of 2017 John W.

In <i>Light on Life,</i> B.K.S. Iyengar brings readers this new and more complete understanding of the yogic journey.</p><p>Here Iyengar explores the yogic goal to integrate the different parts of the self (body, emotions, mind, and soul), the role that the yoga postures and breathing techniques play in our search for wholeness, the external and internal obstacles that keep us from progressing along the path, and how yoga can transform our lives and help us to live in harmony with the world around us. For the first time, Iyengar uses stories from his own life, humor, and examples from modern culture to illustrate the profound gifts that yoga offers. Written with the depth of this sage's great wisdom,<i> Light on Life</i> is the culmination of a master's spiritual genius, a treasured companion to his seminal <i>Light on Yoga</i>.</p></p><p>If this book is to lay any claim to authenticity, it must make one point clear above all others. It is this: By persistent and sustained practice, anyone and everyone can make the yoga journey and reach the goal of illumination and freedom. Krishna, Buddha, and Jesus lie in the hearts of all. They are not film stars, mere idols of adulation. They are great inspirational figures whose example is there to be followed. They act as our role models today. Just as they reached Self-Realization, so may we.<br> <br> Many of you may worry that you are unable to meet the challenges that lie ahead. I want to assure you that you can. I am a man who started from nowhere; I was heavily disadvantaged in many ways. After much time and effort, I began to reach somewhere. I literally emerged from darkness to light, from mortal sickness to health, from crude ignorance to immersion in the ocean of knowledge by one means alone, namely by zealous persistence in the art and science of yoga practice (sadhana). What held good for me will hold good for you too. Today you also have the benefit of many gifted yoga teachers. <br> <br> When I began yoga, there was, I am sorry to say, no wise, kind teacher to lead me. In fact my own Guru refused to answer any of my innocent inquiries on yoga. He did not instruct me as I do my students, offering them step-by-step guidance in an asana. He would simply demand a posture and leave it to me or his other students to figure out how it could be realized. Perhaps that stimulated some stubborn aspect of my nature, which allied to unshakable faith in the subject of yoga made me burn to go on. I am ardent and passionate, and maybe I needed to show the world that I was not worthless. But far more than that, I wanted to find out who I was. I wanted to understand this mysterious and marvelous "yoga," which could reveal to us our innermost secrets, as equally as it revealed those of the universe around us and our place in it as joyful, suffering, puzzled human beings.<p>B.K.S IYENGAR, world-renowned yoga master, has been called by <i>The New York Times </i>"one of the most penetrating writers on yoga alive today." Iyengar's bestselling classics <i>Light on Yoga</i> and Y<i>oga: the Path to Holistic Health</i>, head the Amazon.com list as the two best yoga books ever written.

In the twilight of the Cold War (the late 1980s), nine-year old Lev Golinkin and his family cross the Soviet border with only ten suitcases, $600, and the vague promise of help awaiting in Vienna. Years later, Lev, now an American adult, sets out to retrace his family's long trek, locate the strangers who fought for his freedom, and in the process, gain a future by understanding his past.</b><br><br>Lev Golinkin's memoir is the vivid, darkly comic, and poignant story of a young boy in the confusing and often chilling final decade of the Soviet Union. It's also the story of Lev Golinkin, the American man who finally confronts his buried past by returning to Austria and Eastern Europe to track down the strangers who made his escape possible . . . and say thank you. Written with biting, acerbic wit and emotional honesty in the vein of Gary Shteyngart, Jonathan Safran Foer, and David Bezmozgis, Golinkin's search for personal identity set against the relentless currents of history is more than a memoir&#x2014;it's a portrait of a lost era. This is a thrilling tale of escape and survival, a deeply personal look at the life of a Jewish child caught in the last gasp of the Soviet Union, and a provocative investigation into the power of hatred and the search for belonging. Lev Golinkin achieves an amazing feat&#x2014;and it marks the debut of a fiercely intelligent, defiant, and unforgettable new voice.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2014:</strong> Lev Golinkin&#x2019;s memoir, <i>A Backpack, A Bear, Eight Crates of Vodk</i>a, begins with a trip back in time, when he experienced harsh prejudice as a young Jewish boy in the Ukraine, and leading into chaotic final years of the Soviet Union when his family made their escape and rebuilt their lives with the help of American Jewish aid workers. Fast forward to Lev Golinkin all grown up and now an American citizen searching for identity in the footsteps of his past.

For too long we&#x2019;ve inured ourselves to the wild intelligence of our muscled flesh, taking our primary truths from technologies that hold the living world at a distance. This book subverts that distance, drawing readers ever deeper into their animal senses in order to explore, from within, the elemental kinship between the body and the breathing Earth.<br>&nbsp;<br>The shapeshifting of ravens, the erotic nature of gravity, the eloquence of thunder, the pleasures of being edible: all have their place in Abram&#x2019;s investigation.

His first book, <em>The Spell of the Sensuous</em>, has become a touchstone for a needed shift in our thinking about the place of humans in the world. As the poet Gary Snyder remarked, that book helped map us back into the world. In his new book, <em>Becoming Animal</em>, Abram offers a startling new exploration of our entanglement with the rest of nature. This time, his focus is the intimate but sadly forgotten relationship between our bodies and the earth. By excavating the most ordinary and familiar of our experiences--the perception of shadow, the recognition of depth, the transience of mood--he re-opens for us the knowing that our bodies are intertwined with the flesh of the earth. I cannot imagine another book that so gently and so persuasively alters how we look at ourselves, and reminds us that sentience was never our private possession, that our very awareness is a means of participating in a more than human world. At no other time in Western history have we needed to listen to the wild voice within us, and to Dave Abram's, as much as we do today.</p><p><b>David Abram</b> is an ecologist, anthropologist, and philosopher who lectures widely around the world.

The broad-ranging introduction unravels the myths that surround sainthood. It discusses questions such as why saintly symbols are so important in Christian art; the significance of relics and how certain places become holy sites, and how the purpose of pilgrimage has changed over the centuries. The second part of the book is a fully illustrated encyclopedia of over 500 saints, listed in chronological order from the Apostles and early Christian martyrs to 20th-century saints. The life and work of each saint is described. As well as dozens of well-known and well-loved saints such as St Christopher, St Theresa of Avila and St Francis of Assisi, entries also include 1st-century martyrs, African saints of the 19th century, and a Jewish woman who embraced Christianity only to suffer horrendous punishment in 20th-century Germany. Themed spreads throughout the book explore subjects such as Celtic Saints, Saints and Animals, and Symbolism and Saints. There are charts of patron saints for every activity from housework to computers, lost things tomusic. And there are lists of some of the most popular Feast Days from around the world. The book is illustrated with more than 500 beautiful color images of saints and the places they lived their lives; among them are some of the finest works of Western art. A valuable reference book for any historian, this expert and authoritative guide will absorb, entertain, and fascinate every reader interested in discovering more about Christianity and the lives of the saints.</p><p></p><h2>The Road Less Traveled And Beyond : Spiritual Growth In An Age Of Anxiety</h2><p>The founder of the Foundation for Community Encouragement draws on his counseling experience to lead readers to the spiritual simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity and explains how to cope with the fears and shortcomings of life</p><p>The potential danger in this book's title is the assumption that Peck is rehashing the same material he wrote in <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>. Thankfully, this isn't so. Although he touches upon the same themes that appear in most everything he writes--narcissism vs. self-love and good vs. evil--Peck is clearly speaking to the crucial dilemmas of the 1990s, such as overly simplistic thinking, institutionalized racism and sexism, as well as the media's despairing vision. Now that Peck has reached the maturity of 60, his narrative is less know-it-all than in the days of yore. Yet, ironically, his decades of research, writing, and human service give him more authority than ever.<p><i>The Road Less Traveled and Beyond</i> is the culmination of a lifetime of Dr. M. Scott Peck's counseling, lecturing, and writing, and the conclusion of the "Road" trilogy. In it, we are led to a deeper awareness of how to live rich, fulfilling lives in a world fraught with stress and anxiety. </p><p>With the rare combination of profound psychological insight and deep spirituality that has already spoken to millions of readers, Dr. Peck talks about decision making and the choices we make every day in business and at home, and the ethical choices that may affect the very survival of humankind. We learn the difference between good and evil, to overcome narcissism, to love and be loved, to live with paradox, to accept the consequences of our actions all through life, and to come to terms with dying and death. </p><p>Dr. Peck is a guide on the adventure that is life, learning, and spiritual growth&#x2014;life's greatest adventure. Building in depth and power from the very first chapter to its lyrical and poetic conclusion, <i>The Road Less Traveled and Beyond</i> is an adventure in itself.</p></p><h2>Heirs of the King: Living the Beatitudes</h2><p>&#34;Most people think of the Beatitudes as a collection of idealistic sayings- beautiful to read but impossible to practice.

That is until 1904, when the disease broke out in a household in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Authorities suspected the family cook, Mary Mallon, of being a carrier. But before she could be tested, the woman, soon to be known as Typhoid Mary, had disappeared. Over the course of the next three years, Mary worked at several residences, spreading her pestilence as she went. In 1907, she was traced to a home on Park Avenue, and taken into custody. Institutionalized at Riverside Hospital for three years, she was released only when she promised never to work as a cook again. She promptly disappeared. </p><p>For the next five years Mary worked in homes and institutions in and around New York, often under assumed names. In February 1915, a devastating outbreak of typhoid at the Sloane Hospital for Women was traced to her. She was finally apprehended and reinstitutionalized at Riverside Hospital, where she would remain for the rest of her life. </p><p><i>Typhoid Mary</i> is the story of her infamous life. Anthony Bourdain reveals the seedier side of the early 1900s, and writes with his renowned panache about life in the kitchen, uncovering the horrifying conditions that allowed the deadly spread of typhoid over a decade. <i>Typhoid Mary</i> is a true feast for history lovers and Bourdain lovers alike.</p></p><p><p><b>Anthony Bourdain</b> is the bestselling author of <i>Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly</i>, and the author of the novels: <i>Bone in the Throat</i> and <i>Gone Bamboo</i>. He is the executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York City.</p>Bloomsbury launches its "Urban Historicals" series with a pair of books on both New York's most infamous cook and what (if true) would have been the city's greatest hoax. Bourdain, the chef and author of last year's cheeky Kitchen Confidential, attempts to retell the story of Mary Mallon from a cook's perspective. Early in the last century, the Irish immigrant Mallon became notorious as "Typhoid Mary" and was imprisoned by health authorities on an island in the East River after (unwittingly or not) spreading typhoid to 33 victims, with three confirmed deaths. Like Lizzie Borden, Mallon has received various writers' interpretations, the last in a 1996 biography by Judith Leavitt of the same title (LJ 5/15/96) that told the tale with more health science and a less cranky style. Bourdain chooses to light the story's shadows by relating to her as a once-proud, broken-down cook, interpreting Mallon's infecting spree with a kitchen-hardened aplomb and New York attitude. Chapter titles tend toward the snarky and hip ("There's Something About Mary," "Typhoid sucks"), and only a New York guy would describe bacteria settling into a gall bladder "like rent-controlled pensioners." Yet when, at the work's end, Bourdain makes a cook-to-cook offering at Mary's grave, it somehow feels more moving than stagey. Rose, a novelist and founder of the 1980s literary magazine Between C&amp;D, has created "an entertainment, a reimagining of a piece of the past that may well have been imagined in the first place." His light-handed telling concerns a possible hoax from about 1824, when a butcher and a carpenter in New York's old Centre Market purportedly discussed their plan to solve overbuilt Manhattan's dangerous bottom-heaviness by sawing it in half, turning the top part of the island around, and reattaching it at the Battery. Word spread, and the enormous project seized the imaginations of Manhattan's poor, who showed up by the hundreds with saws and shovels, while merchants set aside enormous stores of food for the expected work crews. So, at least, claimed one of the hoaxers years later in a conversation with his amateur-historian nephew. Instead of being the "Crop Circles" phenomenon of its day, however, there seems no reason to believe the sawing scam was put over on anyone beyond the credulous nephew who first recorded it; Rose is quite aware of this and puts this re-embroidered lore into entertaining context, along the way creating a charming, atmospheric portrait of old New York. He also notes some classic period cons (the 161-year-old slave who nursed George Washington; the embalmed mermaid) perpetrated by the era's proven master humbuggers.

After her mother died of cancer at the age of fifty-five, Meghan O'Rourke found that nothing had prepared her for the intensity of her sorrow. In the first anguished days, she began to create a record of her interior life as a mourner, trying to capture the paradox of grief-its monumental agony and microscopic intimacies-an endeavor that ultimately bloomed into a profound look at how caring for her mother during her illness changed and strengthened their bond. <br><br>O'Rourke's story is one of a life gone off the rails, of how watching her mother's illness-and separating from her husband-left her fundamentally altered. But it is also one of resilience, as she observes her family persevere even in the face of immeasurable loss. <br><br>With lyricism and unswerving candor, <i>The Long Goodbye</i> conveys the fleeting moments of joy that make up a life, and the way memory can lead us out of the jagged darkness of loss.

She is a cultural critic for <i>Slate</i>, and her essays and poems have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, The Nation, </i>and other publications. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.Starred Review. In this eloquent, somber memoir about the death of her mother and grieving aftermath, poet and journalist O'Rourke (Halflife) ponders the eternal human question: how do we live with the knowledge that we will one day die? O'Rourke's mother died of metastatic colorectal cancer on Christmas day 2008; the headmaster of a Westport, Conn., private school, she was only 55 years old, and left a stricken husband, two sons, and daughter O'Rourke, the eldest sibling. O'Rourke had shuttled back and forth from her life in Brooklyn and then job at Slate over the preceding year to care for her increasingly debilitated mother. The two were extremely close, and the shock of her mother's illness devastated the whole family (the author married her longtime boyfriend shortly after the Stage 4 diagnosis, then separated just as quickly). Over the last months, O'Rourke was bracing herself, "preparing" for her mother's death, by reading everything she could during the dizzying rounds of doctors' and hospital visits, until the family could take their mother home to die in a heavily medicated peace. Anxious by nature, secretive, often emotionally brittle, O'Rourke grew acutely sensitive to her mother's changing states over the last months, desperate for a sign of her mother's love to carry her through the months of bereavement. O'Rourke heals herself in this pensive, cerebral work, moving from intense anguish and nostalgia to finding solace in dreams, sex, and the comforting words of other authors.

During this time the apostle Paul joined the movement and began to preach to the gentiles. <br><br>Using the oldest Christian documents that we have&#x2014;the letters of Paul&#x2014;as well as other early Christian sources, historian and scholar James Tabor reconstructs the origins of Christianity. Tabor reveals that the familiar figures of James, Peter, and Paul sometimes disagreed fiercely over everything from the meaning of Jesus&#x2019; message to the question of whether converts must first become Jews. Tabor shows how Paul separated himself from Peter and James to introduce his own version of Christianity, which would continue to develop independently of the message that Jesus, James, and Peter preached. <br><br><i>Paul and Jesus </i>gives us a new and deeper understanding of Paul as it illuminates the fascinating period of history when Christianity was born out of Judaism and became the religion we recognize today.</p><p><b>James D. Tabor</b> is chair of the department of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. He holds a PhD in biblical studies and is an expert on Christian origins. He is the author of several books, among them <i>The Jesus Dynasty.</i> Visit him online at JamesTabor.com.*Starred Review* There have been a number of books written about Paul and his relationship to the apostles; to James, the brother of Jesus; and to the early Christian community in Jerusalem. But Tabor, a professor of religion, does a particularly fine job of explaining Paul&#x2019;s unique view of Jesus and how he originated a gospel that had almost nothing to do with the life of Jesus, nor the messianic message as it was understood by Jesus&#x2019; first followers. Tabor contends that Paul&#x2019;s letters&#x2014;Corinthians and Romans, especially&#x2014;are the oldest biblical documents we have dating to Jesus&#x2019; time; the Gospels and even the Acts of the Apostles came later. Within this time line, it is possible to trace Paul&#x2019;s thinking and to come to an understanding of both Paul&#x2019;s gospel and the schism that developed between Paul and Jesus&#x2019; apostles. Tabor does very little speculating, keeping his focus on the texts and placing them within the context of first-century Judaism and early Christianity. The crisp, clear writing gives readers much to consider&#x2014;especially the fact that it is a Pauline Christianity that most Christians practice today. Tabor writes in the preface that he has spent much of his adult life studying early Christianity in general and Paul in particular. The depth of his scholarship shows, but he also makes this an enjoyable read for those who want to know more about one of history&#x2019;s greatest mysteries. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>The Long Road to Gettysburg</h2><p>A description of the Battle of Gettysburg as seen through the eyes of nineteen-year-old Confederate lieutenant John Dooley and seventeen-year-old Union soldier Thomas Galway.</p><p>Experience first hand the bloodiest battle of the Civil War through the eyes of two teenage military officers &#x2013; one from the North and one from the South!<b>Jim Murphy</b>'s nonfiction books have received numerous awards, among them two Newbery Honors, the Sibert Medal, three Orbis Pictus awards, the Margaret A.

An accomplished biologist, Sheldrake proposes that all natural systems, from crystals to human society, inherit a collective memory that influences their form and behavior. Rather than being ruled by fixed laws, nature is essentially habitual. <em>The Presence of the Past</em> lays out the evidence for Sheldrake's controversial theory, exploring its implications in the fields of biology, physics, psychology, and sociology. At the same time, Sheldrake delivers a stinging critique of conventional scientific thinking. In place of the mechanistic, neo-Darwinian worldview he offers a new understanding of life, matter, and mind.</p><p>Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D., is a former Research Fellow of the Royal Society and was a scholar of Clare College, Cambridge, and a Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard University. His other books include <em>A New Science of Life</em>, <em>The Rebirth of Nature</em>, and <em>Seven Experiments That Could Change the World</em>. He lives in London with his wife and two sons.Biochemist Sheldrake maintains that if a pigeon in London learns a new habit, then pigeons everywhere else will automatically show an increasing tendency to learn the same habit. He holds that invisible energy patterns or "morphogenetic fields" surround and shape all atoms, all crystals, all pigeons and all humans. In his astonishing theory, any natural systemwhether insulin molecules, dandelions or societiesinherits a collective memory from all previous members of that group. Experimental evidence for Sheldrake's hypothesis is inconclusive but tantalizing. If true, it would force a radical revision of our understanding of genetics, evolution, memory, learning. Many books on the "new physics" and the paranormal have discussed Sheldrake's ideas, but his own explanation of morphic resonance is the most lucid and exciting account to date. He uses the theory here to suggest how creation myths and rituals connect past and present. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Waging Heavy Peace</h2><p>A <i>New York Times, Los Angeles Times, </i>and <i>USA Today </i>bestseller.<br><br>For the first time, legendary singer, songwriter, and guitarist Neil Young offers a kaleidoscopic view of his personal life and musical creativity. He tells of his childhood in Ontario, where his father instilled in him a love for the written word; his first brush with mortality when he contracted polio at the age of five; struggling to pay rent during his early days with the Squires; traveling the Canadian prairies in Mort, his 1948 Buick hearse; performing in a remote town as a polar bear prowled beneath the floorboards; leaving Canada on a whim in 1966 to pursue his musical dreams in the pot-filled boulevards and communal canyons of Los Angeles; the brief but influential life of Buffalo Springfield, which formed almost immediately after his arrival in California. He recounts their rapid rise to fame and ultimate break-up; going solo and overcoming his fear of singing alone; forming Crazy Horse and writing &#x201c;Cinnamon Girl,&#x201d; &#x201c;Cowgirl in the Sand,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Down by the River&#x201d; in one day while sick with the flu; joining Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, recording the landmark CSNY album, <i>D�j� vu, </i>and writing the song, &#x201c;Ohio;&#x201d; life at his secluded ranch in the redwoods of Northern California and the pot-filled jam sessions there; falling in love with his wife, Pegi, and the birth of his three children; and finally, finding the contemplative paradise of Hawaii. Astoundingly candid, witty, and as uncompromising and true as his music, <i>Waging Heavy Peace </i>is Neil Young&#x2019;s journey as only he can tell it.</p><p>Neil Young&#x2019;s music and songwriting&#x2014;which span forty years and thirty-four studio albums of rock and roll, folk, and country, with shadings of blues, techno, and other styles&#x2014;are among the most enduring and popular in modern times. From his early days with Buffalo Springfield through his solo career and collaborations with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Crazy Horse, and dozens of other notable musicians and groups, Young is acclaimed for both his musical talents and his artistic integrity. With a major hit in every decade since the sixties, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice (as a solo artist in 1995 and as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997). A well-known political activist, environmentalist, and philanthropist, Young has been involved in several causes, notably cofounding Farm Aid and The Bridge School, which assists children with physical impairments and communication needs.&#x201c;Elliptical and personal...<i>Waging Heavy Peace </i>eschews chronology and skips the score-settling and titillation of other rocker biographies. Still, Young shows a little leg and has some laughs.... As the book progresses, the operatics of the rock life give way to signal family events, deconstructions of his musical partnerships and musings on the natural world. It is less a chronicle than a journal of self-appraisal.&#x201d; &#x2013;David Carr, <i>The New York Times </i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Waging Heavy Peace </i>finally is Neil Young on Neil Young. Inasmuch as this memoir compares to anything, it's Dylan on Dylan in <i>Chronicles Volume 1</i>, and at the risk of offending, one must read it as perhaps one might the Bible: Young's reality is plastic, his prose prophetic; and myth, metaphor and madness meander through his musings....It is a beautiful book, and the sturdy stock gives it a substantial heft. The prose is conversational, peppered with sentence fragments, more stream-of-consciousness than narrative. This in itself is lovely, as reading this book likely is a close as most of us will get to riding with Young in his bus, shooting the breeze, reminiscing.&#x201d; &#x2013;Ted St. Godard, <i>Winnipeg Free Press </i>(Canada) <br><br>&#x201c;Terrific: modest, honest, funny and frequently moving...<i>Waging Heavy Peace</i> takes the form of a diary, a life-in-the-day structure that gives Mr. Young room to maneuver, as he takes us on a wander round his memory palace... In many ways, the closest antecedent to <i>Waging Heavy Peace</i> may be Laurence Sterne's 1760 masterpiece, <i>Tristram Shandy</i>...Elegance itself.&#x201d; &#x2013;Wesley Stace, <i>Wall Street Journal </i><br><br>&#x201c;An inspirational account of tragedy, triumph, and toy trains...If you love Neil Young you will love his autobiography....There is humor in his approach, and a preoccupation with the feeling of things; of sound, and with the world of soul and spirit.... [Young&#x2019;s] is a hero&#x2019;s story; a man put through trial after trial who is still fighting at the end with humor, courage, and rage to be the most powerful and genuine artist he can possibly be.&#x201d; &#x2013;Suzanne Vega, <i>The Times</i> (London) <br><br>&#x201c;Remarkable...Young has neither burned out nor faded away.&#x201d; &#x2013;Bruce Ward, <i>The Ottawa Citizen </i><br><br>&#x201c;Revealing, even (at times) oddly beautiful, a stream-of-consciousness-meditation on where Young has been, where he thinks he's going and, perhaps most revealing, where he is right now.... It is compelling to see a figure as prominent as Young &#x2014; arguably one of the five or 10 most influential figures in the history of rock 'n' roll &#x2014; express himself in such an unfiltered way.&#x201d; &#x2013;David Ulin, <i>The Los Angeles Times </i><br><br>&#x201c;Full of casual asides, unpredictable tangents and open-ended questions as he looks back on his life at age 66....Young appears to be setting down his memories in real time as they occur to him...Dryly hilarious...poignant....<i>Waging Heavy Peace </i>shows that Young is still in full possession of that stubborn, brilliant, one-of-a-kind instrument. He doesn't always go exactly where you want him to, or stay long enough once he gets there, but did anyone really expect anything else?" &#x2013;Simon Vozick-Levinson, <i>Rolling Stone </i>(four stars) <br><br>&#x201c;Like an epic jam with Crazy Horse, it's loose and baggy and always in the moment... The strength of <i>Waging Heavy Peace </i>lies in its openness and honesty. When you put Young's book down, you feel you know him.&#x201d; &#x2013;Dan DeLuca, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer </i><br><br>&#x201c;An honest, insightful, engaging and, dare we say, fun literary rambling. It&#x2019;s a yarn told by a good buddy in a dark bar over beers and tequilas with great music on the jukebox in the background.&#x201d; &#x2013;Bob Ruggiero, <i>The Houston Chronicle </i><br><br>&#x201c;Surreal....Fittingly, <i>Peace </i>unfolds like a blustery Crazy Horse jam...occasionally hitting on an enrapturing revelation ...a contradictory tale...refreshing.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Entertainment Weekly </i><br><br>"Young has consistently demonstrated the unbridled passion of an artist who understands that self-renewal is the only way to avoid burning out. For this reason, he has remained one of the most significant artists of the rock and roll era." &#x2014;Eddie Vedder <br><br>&#x201c;Young writes with dry eloquence in a voice that is clearly his own...His narrative voice is like his music&#x2014;direct, emotional, hopeful, sometimes funny, willfully na�ve, and often, quite beautiful... At its core, <i>Waging Heavy Peace </i>is a story about love of the enduring variety.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jeff Miers, <i>Buffalo News</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Lively, rollicking, high-spirited, and reflective... Like one of his long, inventive jams, Young weaves crystalline lyrics and notes about friends... with reflections on the enduring beauty of nature, and the lasting power and influence of music.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred) <br><br>&#x201c;Straight from the wandering mind and pure heart of Neil Young...

Is it happiness? Love? Less struggle? An unbumpable ticket to stress relief? As you&#x2019;ll soon learn, the power is within you to achieve these. Or maybe you&#x2019;ve completely sworn off wishing in response to a pile-up of disappointments. Of course, I&#x2019;ve known that sentiment: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the use?&#x201d; Right? Wrong! Such woe-is-me resignation corners you in some godforsaken dead-end unfit for serenity. My determined hope is that you&#x2019;ll give wishing for what&#x2019;s wonderful another chance. There are moments when opportunities arise. This is one, the staking out of your emotional freedom. Freshly fallen snow, not a single footprint&#x2014;the path of new beginnings. Your first steps are truly memorable. Don&#x2019;t ever forget them. Let me tell you about mine.<br><br>The door to emotional freedom cracked open for me as a teenager in southern California. It was 1968. I was sixteen, a flower child in paisley crop tops, holey jeans, and leather combat boots or barefoot, heavily into the drug scene. My parents were frantic. They kept trying to get through to me, but I made that impossible. My rebellion wasn&#x2019;t just against them but to save myself. Though Mother and Dad couldn&#x2019;t have loved me more, I felt suffocated by their mainstream vision of who they thought I should be, what would make me happy. Jewish country clubs, &#x201c;presentable&#x201d; clothes, conservative friends . . . I didn&#x2019;t think so. Some nights, I even slept in my beloved jeans (my mother despised them) to feel more free. At the same time, I didn&#x2019;t want to be who I was&#x2014;so sensitive, not quite of this world. Since childhood I&#x2019;d experienced many intuitions and dreams that came true, like the times I predicted my grandfather&#x2019;s death and my parents&#x2019; friends&#x2019; divorce, when no one else saw either coming. These and other similar incidents unsettled and confused me. To make matters worse, my parents became so unnerved that I was forbidden to talk to them about my intuitions. Then I was sure there was something really wrong with me, a dread I was totally alone with. I didn&#x2019;t choose to predict these things. They just kept happening. I had huge forces churning inside and no way of reconciling them.<br><br>Finally, one night, my parents became hell-bent on ending my flirtation with disaster. In a show of gutsy unity, they packed my things, marched me into the car, and checked their only child into a private locked adolescent substance abuse unit of Westwood Psychiatric Hospital. I felt set up, betrayed, and howled my indignation. I did everything in my power to hide my fear. This was where my path to emotional freedom began.<br><br>Every moment in that hospital seems so alive to me now. How I fought the kindness I was offered. Initially I felt like a prisoner. Cooperate? Not a chance. I tried everyone&#x2019;s patience. In daily group therapy sessions I refused to talk. The leader, a tough-love former biker babe in denim, would confront me: &#x201c;Judi [my nickname then], why are you so angry?&#x201d; &#x201c;Huh? I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d snap, tight-lipped and seething. The more she&#x2019;d probe, the more I&#x2019;d clam up, pretending to everyone, including myself, just how fine I was. I&#x2019;d be equally forthcoming with my psychiatrist. At meals twenty of us teenagers would sit in a beige cafeteria with plastic utensils (silverware can become weapons) eating some rubberized version of food. I fully intended to isolate myself, until Windy, a fellow hippie patient who lived in her long-fringed brown suede jacket, befriended me. My prickly exterior didn&#x2019;t seem to faze her. Windy&#x2019;s innocent nature quickly won me over; we became inseparable.<br><br>Comrades in captivity, during downtime we&#x2019;d huddle in my room with its barred windows, plotting our escape. How we&#x2019;d slip past the night cleaning crew after they wheeled their mops and brooms through the entrance of our locked unit. Then we&#x2019;d hitch a ride to the coast highway, a few miles away, and head to parts unknown. No parents. No authorities. Just free. Though our great escape never came to fruition, all our scheming, giggling, and singing to the Stones (&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t always get what you want . . . but you just might find you get what you need&#x201d;) made confinement more palatable.<br><br>Still, I loathed being locked up, and saw no reason to examine my life or change. But other mysterious influences beyond my control seemed to be operating too. I remember there was a door at the end of our green linoleum hall. It stood between us and a fenced yard where we played volleyball. The most brilliant light would shine through its wired panes. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the light. Something loving within that brilliance quieted my snarl, soothed me when words couldn&#x2019;t. Ever since I was a child, I&#x2019;d felt a loving presence keeping track of me, an invisible friend offering comfort. Usually it stayed in the background, but now it was stepping forward. There was a change wanting to happen within me, and despite my protests, it began with a velocity all its own. Slowly, miraculously, I softened during my fourteen days in this unit.<br><br>With the guidance of a wise psychiatrist who understood me and knew how to intervene, I started to realize that I hadn&#x2019;t been free in my life before being confined here. I was rebelling against my parents, but without clarity or focus. I was reactive, not proactive. Rebellion and living on the margins were how I&#x2019;d survived, yet they weren&#x2019;t the endpoint. Over the next few years, this angel of a man showed me how to better deal with my emotions so I could come from a place that was truer for me. He also helped me begin to embrace my intuitive side, so vital to knowing my soul. Our work together set into motion my calling to become a physician and bring intuition into medicine&#x2014;a genuinely unexpected destiny. Though both my parents were physicians and there were twenty-five physicians in my extended family, given my artistic nature, they&#x2019;d never urged this career on me. Getting an M.D. was the last thing I thought I wanted.<br><br>Life went on. Two decades later I was a psychiatrist seeing patients in that same hospital. In my case, the (former) inmate truly was running the institution! I felt deliciously subversive. How enlightening to have been a patient on the inside with a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of being incarcerated and at the mercy of strangers. What better way to develop compassion for people in the same position . . . and to learn how to risk receiving the compassion the staff had once shown me? These are some of the jewels I&#x2019;ve taken with me in my search for emotional freedom.<br><br>The hospital was flattened by the Northridge earthquake in 1994, and I must admit, I miss not seeing it when I drive by the site. Mother and Dad shared none of my nostalgia. My teenage self was a nightmare from which they never quite recovered. Incredibly, even in their elder years, they occasionally felt obliged to set the record straight. Summoning up looks of horror I knew so well, they&#x2019;d half jokingly say to me&#x2014;a grown woman, for decades a doctor of whom they were extremely proud&#x2014;&#x201c;Judith, we&#x2019;ve never gotten over your adolescence.&#x201d;<br><br>the basics of emotional freedom: the start of your liberation<br><br>Your life is brimming with opportunities to learn about emotional freedom. Every success. Every heartbreak. Every loss. Every gain. How you transport yourself through these portals determines how free you can be. I want you to start viewing your emotions in a nonordinary way: as vehicles for transformation (the word emotion comes from the Latin meaning &#x201c;to move&#x201d;) rather than simply as feelings that make you happy or miserable. Expect them to test your heart; that&#x2019;s the point. What you go through&#x2014;what we all go through&#x2014;has a greater purpose. Always, the imperative of emotional freedom is for the love in us to evolve. Albert Camus says, &#x201c;Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better.&#x201d; To make this a reality, you must begin to see each event of your life, uplifting or hurtful, earthshaking or mundane, as a chance to grow stronger, smarter, more light-bearing.<br><br>But here&#x2019;s where many of us hit a wall. We&#x2019;re ashamed of feeling afraid, inadequate, lonely, as if we&#x2019;ve failed or done something wrong. None of these conclusions are true. It&#x2019;s a misguided expectation that we&#x2019;re supposed to be serene all the time. A depressed patient once apologized, &#x201c;I wish I could be coming to you for something more spiritual.&#x201d; I felt for him, but like so many people in pain with that commonly held perception, he was mistaken. Facing emotions&#x2014;all of them&#x2014;is a courageous, spiritually transformative act.<br><br>As you look into yourself, this is a failproof formula for liberation: dare to keep expanding your heart even if you&#x2019;ve been justifiably wounded by pain or disappointment. The effort is never wasted. As you do, ferociously resist selling out by becoming cynical or shutting down (claustrophobic states worse than death to me). No matter what you&#x2019;ve experienced, there is always hope for change and healing. It&#x2019;s a miracle within reach. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to want it.<br><br>The way to start is to understand the basics of emotional freedom. Here&#x2019;s a mission statement that summarizes the process. To stay clear about your purpose and goals, you can refer to it while exploring the principles of this book.<br><br>What does emotional freedom mean?<br><br>It&#x2019;s the capacity to give and receive more love. Getting there entails building positive emotions as well as facing and releasing negative ones. Instead of spinning out with, say, anger after you&#x2019;ve been hurt, you&#x2019;ll respond from a centered, more empathic place. Emotional freedom includes both personal and spiritual evolution. Learning to work with negative emotions, rather than collapsing into them, helps you grow spiritually and rise above what is small within you. Becoming free means removing counterproductive emotional patterns and viewing yourself and others through the lens of the heart.<br><br>Why do I need it?<br><br>To liberate yourself from the quicksand of negative emotions. When these accumulate, they disrupt your calmness and compassion, destroy relationships, and ultimately distance you from the joy and wonder of the world.<br><br>How do I achieve it?<br><br>Emotions become a springboard for higher consciousness once you see that each one has a lesson to impart. I&#x2019;ll show you, for instance, how to build patience to counter frustration. Sometimes, though, as with acute grief, you&#x2019;ll learn that you need to just be with the feelings, whereas you can aim to heal and transform envy. There are two stages of processing emotions. First is healthily acknowledging the raw feeling rather than stuffing or airbrushing it. The second is transforming negativity. I&#x2019;ll explain many methods to do this with a variety of emotions.<br><br>The outcome?<br><br>You&#x2019;ll feel happier, more flexible and alive; you&#x2019;ll also be kinder to yourself, your friends, and family. You&#x2019;ll have increased patience with coworkers and be able to effectively resolve conflicts. You&#x2019;ll connect with your deepest instincts and the power of the heart to surmount even the most disappointing situations. You&#x2019;ll feel nurtured and protected by a spiritual force that will let you know you&#x2019;re never alone.<br><br>I savor this Native American story because it speaks to the essence of emotional freedom:<br><br>A chief is talking to his tribe about two dogs inside his mind: one a white dog that is good and courageous, the other a black dog that is vengeful and angry. Both dogs are fighting to the death. A young brave, unable to wait for the end of the story, asks, &#x201c;Which one will win?&#x201d; The chief responds, &#x201c;The one I feed.&#x201d;<br><br>Remembering this dynamic, set your intention to feed what&#x2019;s best and most beautiful within you, a stance that will impel your liberation.<br><br>The goal of emotional freedom is balance. Although in Western culture, being in touch with emotions has become a pop religion&#x2014; making the expression of feelings an end in itself&#x2014;the point here isn&#x2019;t to self-indulgently emote or to wall off your feelings. Rather it&#x2019;s to become a more caring, aware person. Another goal is to reconnect with your vital essence, which thrives if it&#x2019;s not pulverized by stress and pessimism. What a gorgeous feeling when you&#x2019;re tapped into it!<br><br>You can&#x2019;t just think your way to emotional freedom. Throughout this book I&#x2019;ll keep underscoring that it grows from a linear understanding of biology and behavior, as well as an intuitively sparked transformation in your soul. To create the positive change you desire, get ready to fire up all of your perceptual capacities, even those you never realized you had. You want to see more than a sliver of what&#x2019;s possible for yourself.<br><br>evolving beyond conventional medicine: integrating intuition to better grasp emotions<br><br>A gift of being a psychiatrist is that others entrust me with their deepest feelings and confidences. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve had the opportunity to help countless patients and workshop participants mired in fear, worry, or depression fight to be free. I&#x2019;m no stranger to such predicaments, having endured my own share of emotional trials by fire. We&#x2019;ve all done our time in anguished places. But, as I&#x2019;ll describe, there&#x2019;s a way out, sooner rather than later. My role with patients and with you is to be a midwife to the emergence of your finest, freest selves.<br><br>Along with my conventional medical training, today I utilize intuition to help my patients achieve emotional freedom. In psychotherapy sessions, I combine nonlinear messages from images, knowings, energy, and dreams with insights provided by my analytic mind. This organic blending of sensibilities lets me make the most of my traditional education and also listen to what emerges from my intuition&#x2014;the knower behind the thinker. Intuition provides access to the psyche&#x2019;s deep recesses, which don&#x2019;t speak in sentences or paragraphs and are where unexpected connections are made. Further, I teach patients to access their own intuitive abilities to gain greater emotional knowledge of themselves and others and so their lives aren&#x2019;t marred by false notes. But this integration hasn&#x2019;t always felt so natural, nor have I always practiced psychotherapy in this way.<br><br>I received my basic training in emotions as a fledgling psychiatric resident in the early 1980s. I was working in the emergency room every third night at UCLA and the Veterans Administration hospitals. I learned volumes about emotions in these cauldrons of intensity. I was riveted and heartbroken by the in-your-face hard truths of this deeply human experience. The work asked everything of me. But it was good work and it was real. During those endless nights, I saw it all. A stick-thin anorexic girl (who thought she was fat) with a ruptured esophagus from vomiting repeatedly to lose weight.</p><h2>The Dirty Duck</h2><p>Superintendent Richard Jury has been wrong before. But when stating that &#34;nothing ever happens in Stratford,&#34; he never imagined just how wrong he could be. Besides the stage murders committed nightly at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, a real one has been performed not far from a popular pub known as The Dirty Duck.</p><p></p><h2>The Story of Oklahoma</h2><p>From the tectonic formation of Oklahoma&#x2019;s varied landscape to the recovery and renewal following the Oklahoma City bombing, this readable book includes both the well-known and the not-so-familiar of the state&#x2019;s people, events, and places. W. David Baird and Danney Goble offer fresh perspectives on such widely recognized history makers as Sequoyah, the 1889 Land Run, and the Glenn Pool oil strike. But they also give due attention to Black Seminole John Horse, Tulsa&#x2019;s Greenwood District, Coach Bertha Frank Teague&#x2019;s 40-year winning streak with the Byng Lady Pirates, and other lesser-known but equally important milestones.

The rise of sectionalism and the constant overthrowing of emperors left the empire without a secure superior authority demanding the loyalty of the legions and without the money to support them. Delbr�ck&#x2019;s celebrated work traces the collapse of the Roman military system and its replacement with barbarian mercenaries by the fourth century, following the invasions by the Germanic peoples. <p><i>The Barbarian Invasions</i> opens with a discussion of the military organization of the early German tribes, compares it with that of the early Roman legions, and goes on to show how tactics and strategies changed after entire peoples such as the Goths, Vandals, and Burgundians migrated to Roman soil and formed an uneasy alliance with the Romans. It ends with an examination of the decline of the Germanic-Romanic military system in the Middle Ages and the rise of the feudal system.</p><p>This Bison Book edition marks the first appearance in paperback of the English translation of volume 2 by Walter J. Renfroe Jr.</p></p><p>From the eighth century through the Middle Ages feudalism determined the nature of European warfare. Medieval Warfare begins in the time of Charlemagne, who maintained a military system of freemen and of vassals bound to him in service for lands granted in fief.

The Wellness letter is the number one health-related newsletter in the world. Packed full of information on health and nutrition, this book contains all of the latest thinking on nutrition, shopping, and cooking for people who want to maintain maximum wellness with a minimum of fuss and effort.Margen, nutrition researcher and chair of the editorial board of the University of California, Berkeley Wellness Letter , has compiled a unique reference source. Unlike such references as A.H. and M.E. Emsinger's Foods and Nutrition Encyclopedia (Pegus Pr. , 1983), which is geared to nutritionists, The Columbia Encyclopedia of Nutrition ( LJ 6/1/88) , which offers short articles on all aspects of nutrition but nothing on individual foods, or Nikki and David Goldbeck's The Supermarket Handbook ( LJ 10/15/73 ), which emphasizes the purchasing of foods, The Wellness Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition combines the selection and storage of foods with nutritional information. This resource is well organized, easy to read, and nicely illustrated. Starting with a discussion of nutrition (fiber, fats, vitamins, etc. ), the text then concentrates on types of food (vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, meats and poultry, fish and shellfish, dairy and eggs) , covering over 500 fresh and whole foods that the average American cook would use, although not all regional varieties are included. Accompanied by photographs, each food and its varieties are described with availability information, shopping tips, storage information, preparation ideas, and serving suggestions (although there are no actual recipes). Scattered throughout the text are inset boxes and tables of information, the most important being the nutritional profiles and those giving interesting factual tidbits, e.g., that diabetics who eat a substantial amount of beans need less insulin to control their blood sugar. The appendixes include a cooking terms glossary, fats and oils discussion, and herbs and spices dictionary. The index is useful, but it would have been nice to have had cross references. (When readers are looking for prickly pear pads , for instance, nothing refers them to cactus pear , which is the term used.) This encyclopedia definitely fills a niche between the highly technical nutrition books and the basic how-to-shop books. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Bar bara Keen, Spokane Community Coll.

Organized thematically, it investigates comic art's varied genres - including humour, adventure and titles for girls - and charts the rise, fall and revival of the medium. In so doing, Roger Sabin highlights the careers of the creators behind some of the best-known characters in modern fiction - from Superman to Sgt Rock, Tintin to Tank Girl and the Freak Brothers to the Fat Slags.<br>Encompassing traditions from the USA, Britain, Europe and Japan, Comics, Comix and Graphic Novels presents the most complete and up-to-date survey of comic art available.</p><p>For many years, those interested in the history of the art of comics--from scholars to fans--had very few options. The available books were either filled with glaring errors or far too limited in their scope. Along comes Roger Sabin and his near-definitive history. The best thing about this book is that it begins with a strong foundation--that comics is a separate and unique artistic medium--and goes on to leave practically no stone unturned, from mainstream superheroes to underground work to Japanese manga to the new alternatives to the strong European tradition. There&#39;s even an entire chapter on comics by and aimed toward women, hopefully dispelling the myth that comics are just for boys.Roger Sabin is an arts journalist and lecturer at Central St Martin&#39;s College of Art, London.

He and the little girl were holding hands and walking up Third Avenue in New York City, walking fast, almost running. He looked back over his shoulder and the green car was still there, crawling along slowly in the curbside lane.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Daddy. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at her and saw how pale her face was. There were dark circles under her eyes. He picked her up and sat her in the crook of his arm, but he didn&#x2019;t know how long he could go on like that. He was tired, too, and Charlie was no lightweight anymore.<br> <br>It was five-thirty in the afternoon and Third Avenue was clogged. They were crossing streets in the upper Sixties now, and these cross streets were both darker and less populated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that was what he was afraid of.<br> <br>They bumped into a lady pushing a walker full of groceries. &#x201c;Look where you&#x2019;re goin, whyn&#x2019;t ya?&#x201d; she said, and was gone, swallowed in the hurrying crowds.<br> <br>His arm was getting tired, and he switched Charlie to the other one. He snatched another look behind, and the green car was still there, still pacing them, about half a block behind. There were two men in the front seat and, he thought, a third in the back.<br> <br>What do I do now?<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t know the answer to that. He was tired and scared and it was hard to think. They had caught him at a bad time, and the bastards probably knew it. What he wanted to do was just sit down on the dirty curbing and cry out his frustration and fear. But that was no answer. He was the grownup. He would have to think for both of them.<br> <br>What do we do now?<br> <br>No money. That was maybe the biggest problem, after the fact of the men in the green car. You couldn&#x2019;t do anything with no money in New York. People with no money disappeared in New York; they dropped into the sidewalks, never to be seen again.<br> <br>He looked back over his shoulder, saw the green car was a little closer, and the sweat began to run down his back and his arms a little faster. If they knew as much as he suspected they did&#x2014;if they knew how little of the push he actually had left&#x2014;they might try to take him right here and now. Never mind all the people, either. In New York, if it&#x2019;s not happening to you, you develop this funny blindness. Have they been charting me? Andy wondered desperately. If they have, they know, and it&#x2019;s all over but the shouting. If they had, they knew the pattern. After Andy got some money, the strange things stopped happening for a while. The things they were interested in.<br> <br>Keep walking.<br> <br>Sho, boss. Yassuh, boss. Where?<br> <br>He had gone into the bank at noon because his radar had been alerted&#x2014;that funny hunch that they were getting close again. There was money in the bank, and he and Charlie could run on it if they had to. And wasn&#x2019;t that funny? Andrew McGee no longer had an account at the Chemical Allied Bank of New York, not personal checking, not business checking, not savings. They had all disappeared into thin air, and that was when he knew they really meant to bring the hammer down this time. Had all of that really been only five and a half hours ago?<br> <br>But maybe there was a tickle left. Just one little tickle. It had been nearly a week since the last time&#x2014;that presuicidal man at Confidence Associates who had come to the regular Thursday-night counseling session and then begun to talk with an eerie calmness about how Hemingway had committed suicide. And on the way out, his arm casually around the presuicidal man&#x2019;s shoulders, Andy had given him a push. Now, bitterly, he hoped it had been worth it. Because it looked very much as if he and Charlie were going to be the ones to pay. He almost hoped an echo&#x2014;<br> <br>But no. He pushed that away, horrified and disgusted with himself. That was nothing to wish on anybody.<br> <br>One little tickle, he prayed. That&#x2019;s all, God, just one little tickle. Enough to get me and Charlie out of this jam.<br> <br>And oh God, how you&#x2019;ll pay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. plus the fact that you&#x2019;ll be dead for a month afterward, just like a radio with a blown tube. Maybe six weeks. Or maybe really dead, with your worthless brains leaking out your ears. What would happen to Charlie then?<br> <br>They were coming up on Seventieth Street and the light was against them. Traffic was pouring across and pedestrians were building up at the corner in a bottleneck. And suddenly he knew this was where the men in the green car would take them. Alive if they could, of course, but if it looked like trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, they had probably been briefed on Charlie, too.<br> <br>Maybe they don&#x2019;t even want us alive anymore. Maybe they&#x2019;ve decided just to maintain the status quo. What do you do with a faulty equation? Erase it from the board.<br> <br>A knife in the back, a silenced pistol, quite possibly something more arcane&#x2014;a drop of rare poison on the end of a needle. Convulsions at the corner of Third and Seventieth. Officer, this man appears to have suffered a heart attack.<br> <br>He would have to try for that tickle. There was just nothing else.<br> <br>They reached the waiting pedestrians at the corner. Across the way, DON&#x2019;T WALK held steady and seemingly eternal. He looked back. The green car had stopped. The curbside doors opened and two men in business suits got out. They were young and smooth-cheeked. They looked considerably fresher than Andy McGee felt.<br> <br>He began elbowing his way through the clog of pedestrians, eyes searching frantically for a vacant cab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, man&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For Christ&#x2019; sake, fella!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, mister, you&#x2019;re stepping on my dog&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Andy said desperately. He searched for a cab. There were none. At any other time the street would have been stuffed with them. He could feel the men from the green car coming for them, wanting to lay hands on him and Charlie, to take them with them God knew where, the Shop, some damn place, or do something even worse&#x2014;<br> <br>Charlie laid her head on his shoulder and yawned.<br> <br>Andy saw a vacant cab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Taxi! Taxi!&#x201d; he yelled, flagging madly with his free hand.<br> <br>Behind him, the two men dropped all pretense and ran.<br> <br>The taxi pulled over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold it!&#x201d; one of the men yelled. &#x201c;Police! Police!&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman near the back of the crowd at the corner screamed, and then they all began to scatter.<br> <br>Andy opened the cab&#x2019;s back door and handed Charlie in. He dived in after her. &#x201c;La Guardia, step on it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold it, cabby. Police!&#x201d;<br> <br>The cab driver turned his head toward the voice and Andy pushed&#x2014;very gently. A dagger of pain was planted squarely in the center of Andy&#x2019;s forehead and then quickly withdrawn, leaving a vague locus of pain, like a morning headache&#x2014;the kind you get from sleeping on your neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re after that black guy in the checkered cap, I think,&#x201d; he said to the cabby.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; the driver said, and pulled serenely away from the curb. They moved down East Seventieth.<br> <br>Andy looked back. The two men were standing alone at the curb. The rest of the pedestrians wanted nothing to do with them. One of the men took a walkie-talkie from his belt and began to speak into it. Then they were gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;That black guy,&#x201d; the driver said, &#x201c;whadde do? Rob a liquor store or somethin, you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Andy said, trying to think how to go on with this, how to get the most out of this cab driver for the least push. Had they got the cab&#x2019;s plate number? He would have to assume they had. But they wouldn&#x2019;t want to go to the city or state cops, and they would be surprised and scrambling, for a while at least<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all a bunch of junkies, the blacks in this city,&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlie was going to sleep. Andy took off his corduroy jacket, folded it, and slipped it under her head. He had begun to feel a thin hope. If he could play this right, it might work. Lady Luck had sent him what Andy thought of (with no prejudice at all) as a pushover. He was the sort that seemed the easiest to push, right down the line: he was white (Orientals were the toughest, for some reason); he was quite young (old people were nearly impossible) and of medium intelligence (bright people were the easiest pushes, stupid ones harder, and with the mentally retarded it was impossible).<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve changed my mind,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;Take us to Albany, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; The driver stared at him in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;Man, I can&#x2019;t take a fare to Albany, you out of your mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy pulled his wallet, which contained a single dollar bill. He thanked God that this was not one of those cabs with a bulletproof partition and no way to contact the driver except through a money slot. Open contact always made it easier to push. He had been unable to figure out if that was a psychological thing or not, and right now it was immaterial.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give you a five-hundred-dollar bill,&#x201d; Andy said quietly, &#x201c;to take me and my daughter to Albany. Okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeee-sus, mister&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy stuck the bill into the cabby&#x2019;s hand, and as the cabby looked down at it, Andy pushed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and pushed hard. For a terrible second he was afraid it wasn&#x2019;t going to work, that there was simply nothing left, that he had scraped the bottom of the barrel when he had made the driver see the nonexistent black man in the checkered cab.<br> <br>Then the feeling came&#x2014;as always accompanied by that steel dagger of pain. At the same moment, his stomach seemed to take on weight and his bowels locked in sick, gripping agony. He put an unsteady hand to his face and wondered if he was going to throw up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or die. For that one moment he wanted to die, as he always did when he overused it&#x2014;use it, don&#x2019;t abuse it, the sign-off slogan of some long-ago disc jockey echoing sickly in his mind&#x2014;whatever &#x201c;it&#x201d; was. If at that very moment someone had slipped a gun into his hand&#x2014;<br> <br>Then he looked sideways at Charlie, Charlie sleeping, Charlie trusting him to get them out of this mess as he had all the others, Charlie confident he would be there when she woke up. Yes, all the messes, except it was all the same mess, the same fucking mess, and all they were doing was running again. Black despair pressed behind his eyes.<br> <br>The feeling passed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not the headache. The headache would get worse and worse until it was a smashing weight, sending red pain through his head and neck with every pulsebeat. Bright lights would make his eyes water helplessly and send darts of agony into the flesh just behind his eyes. His sinuses would close and he would have to breathe through his mouth. Drill bits in his temples. Small noises magnified, ordinary noises as loud as jackhammers, loud noises insupportable. The headache would worsen until it felt as if his head were being crushed inside an inquisitor&#x2019;s lovecap. Then it would even off at that level for six hours, or eight, or maybe ten. This time he didn&#x2019;t know. He had never pushed it so far when he was so close to drained. For whatever length of time he was in the grip of the headache, he would be next to helpless. Charlie would have to take care of him. God knew she had done it before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but they had been lucky. How many times could you be lucky?<br> <br>&#x201c;Gee, mister, I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Which meant he thought it was law trouble.<br> <br>&#x201c;The deal only goes as long as you don&#x2019;t mention it to my little girl,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;The last two weeks she&#x2019;s been with me. Has to be back with her mother tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Visitation rights,&#x201d; the cabby said. &#x201c;I know all about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You see, I was supposed to fly her up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To Albany? Probably Ozark, am I right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Now, the thing is, I&#x2019;m scared to death of flying. I know how crazy that sounds, but it&#x2019;s true.

He wasn&#x2019;t wondering about Andy&#x2019;s half-baked story. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering what a seven-year-old girl was doing visiting her father for two weeks in October with school in.

He had been pushed.<br> <br>Now Andy would go ahead and pay the price.<br> <br>He put a hand on Charlie&#x2019;s leg. She was fast asleep.

And beneath all that a great, swelling relief.

How close had it been? Had he beaten them by half an hour? Fifteen minutes? Less? He didn&#x2019;t like to think about it.

A splendid biography." --<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>Few figures in American history have held as many roles in public life as John Quincy Adams. The son of John Adams, he was a brilliant ambassador and secretary of state, a frustrated president, and a dedicated congressman who staunchly opposed slavery. In John Quincy Adams, scholar and journalist James Traub draws on Adams's diaries, letters, and writings to evoke his numerous achievements-and failures-in office. A man of unwavering moral convictions, Adams is the father of foreign policy "realism" and one of the first proponents of the "activist government." But John Quincy Adams is first and foremost the story of a brilliant, flinty, and unyielding man whose life exemplified admirable political courage.<br></p><p><strong>James Traub</strong> is a columnist and a regular contributor at ForeignPolicy.com and teaches foreign policy at New York University. He lives in New York City.<br><br>"A splendid new biography.... Reliably thorough, blissfully bereft of jargon, and nicely paced."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Joseph J. Ellis, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>"James Traub does justice to both the man and his times, with a historian's sense of complexity and a writer's eye for drama and detail."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Sean Wilentz</b></i></b><br><br>"By rights, John Quincy Adams should be one of America's most famous presidents. His life story is remarkable, the son of one of the nation's founding presidents, the only one to serve in an elected office after leaving the White House, and a man of vast intelligence and political courage who died while debating in the House of Representatives. Yet he's an obscure figure. James Traub has rectified this in a book worthy of its subject."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Fareed Zakaria, <i>Fareed Zakaria GPS</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Traub's work is a reminder to Americans that politicians can be devoted to national issues, promote their principles, and still maintain their integrity."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Choice</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Well-written and highly readable biography...highly accessible work."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Chronicles </b></i></i></b><br><br>"[An] excellent biography....

Cover has light surface &amp; edge-wear mainly in the corners. There is a crease in the upper corner on the back cover. Spine is firm &amp; uncreased. Text is clean &amp; unmarked with light tanning. During the terrible years od WWII, when inhumanity and political insanity held most of the world in its grip and the Nazi domination of Europe seemed irrevocable and unchallenged, a miraculous event took place in the small Protestant twon in Southern France called LeChambon. It is a story now told for the firts time in this marvelous book. There, quietly and in full view of the Vichy government (the puppet government of the Nazi) and the nearby division of the Nazi SS, Le Chambon's villagers and their clergy organized to save thousands of Jewish children and adults from certain death at the hands of the Nazis. An inspiring true story of courage, faith and virtue. Here in the midst of man's inhumanity to his fellow man was a beckon of light, a small group of people who would not stand by and do nothing. It is a story that will bring you to tears and put a smile on your heart. After reading the story of the village of Le Chambon one is compelled to think of the sorrow and the pity of the era and the courage and faith of a few. A must-read, an excellent true story.

That it can now be published is do to the devotion of his wife, Doris Ann Hallie, who contributed an afterword. The foreword by John Compton, fellow philosopher and longtime friend of the author, will help the reader to understand this unusual document in the context of Hallie's life and thought.</p>&#34;The subject makes a deservedly beautiful book. Mr. Hallie is wholly equal to it.&#34;--Paul Horgan&#34;The thing that makes the story of this village supremely beautiful is simply that it happened. These events took place and therefore demand place in our view of the world. If awareness of history has pushed us to the point of losing faith in ourselves, the case may also be, as professor Hallie says, that &#39;redemption lies in remembering.&#39; &#34;Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed is one of the rarest of books, the kind that can change the way we live.&#34;--&#34;Harper&#39;s&#34;If, as has often been alleged, our old ethics do not work well, the alternatives work worse. But what is stunning about the people of Le Chambon is that the old ethics worked perfectly for them.

The seventeen-syllable form is rooted in a Japanese tradition of close observation of nature, of making poetry from subtle suggestion. Infused by its great practitioners with the spirit of Zen Buddhism, the haiku has served as an example of the power of direct observation to the first generation of American modernist poets like Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and also as an example of spontaneity and Zen alertness to the new poets of the 1950's.</p><p>This definite collection brings together in fresh translations by an American poet the essential poems of the three greatest masters: Matsuo Basho in the seventeenth century; Yosa Buson in the eighteenth century; and Kobayashi Issa in the early nineteenth century.

Why does our brand of Christianity look so insipid compared to the believers of the first century? Where has the power gone? Has God changed, or have we? We've all heard the cop-out that says, "The book of Acts represents a different dispensation." What a sad, self-serving attempt to excuse our current state of spiritual impotence! When we read Acts, we should yearn to experience a return to their brand of Christianity. Yet, instead of copying them, we seem content with copying other modern churches that are "growing." But why copy a copy when you can copy the original (the book of Acts)? In Acts, God was saving people every day. Communities were transformed. People were healed. Demons were cast out. Miracles were commonplace. Churches sprouted up across the Roman Empire. Persecution was faced and overcome. What made them so different? Some say they preached a purer Gospel. I disagree. Modern Evangelicals preach the same Gospel that was proclaimed in the first century. We preach that Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died an atoning death, and rose bodily from the grave. We preach that man is a sinner and stands guilty before God in need of salvation. We preach that God offers salvation by grace, through faith, in Jesus Christ alone, and the moment anyone repents of his sin, puts his faith in Jesus, and calls upon His name, that person is born again. That's the Gospel they preached, and the Gospel we preach. Our lack of spiritual power in Christianity today is not due to the sermons we preach or the songs we sing. Rather, it is due to our lack of prayer. We do not pray like it matters. Jesus and His earliest followers prayed like it was important. We pray like it is inconvenient or inconsequential. Prayer was their priority. It is our postscript. We plan more than we pray. They prayed more than they planned. We gather to minister to one another. They gathered to minister to the Lord in prayer and fasting. Our focus is earthly, horizontal. Theirs was heavenly, vertical. They were wise enough to "pray the price." All of this is why I have written this 12-week Bible study entitled <em>Pray Like It Matters</em>. I want to demonstrate from Scripture that every prayer we pray is significant. Through our prayers, God changes things. One life dedicated to prayer can do more good than any life dedicated to other so-called "noble," worldly causes. An individual follower of Jesus who is committed to prayer is a fountain of life in a world of death. Likewise, the local church that becomes a house of prayer will be a spiritual powerhouse from which God's mighty miracles will flow exponentially. Prayer is what modern Christians and churches are missing&#x2015;frequent, fervent, faithful prayer! Most Christians want to pray but don't know how. They are unable to carry on a simple, sustained, satisfying conversation with God. Thus, after a few minutes in prayer, they run out of things to say, get frustrated, and give up. Sound familiar? Just as infants must be taught to talk, Christians must be taught to pray. Once you know how, prayer will be fulfilling, refreshing, and even fun. A growing number of Christians today are aware that something must be wrong. They know there has to be "more" to the Christian life than what they have experienced. That "more" is found through the discipline of prayer. These lessons are a wakeup call for each individual, family, and church to become a "house of prayer." When we begin to pray like Jesus and His early followers, then we will witness the power they experienced. Today, we embark on what could be the greatest adventure of your life. Before we start, let's pray the prayer of the early disciples: "Lord, teach us to pray" (Luke 11:1).</p><p>A man of prayer and a preacher of God&#x2019;s Word, Dr. Steve Gaines pastored churches in Texas, Tennessee, and Alabama since 1983 before coming to Bellevue Baptist Church in 2005 as senior pastor.

It's a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women's lives."&#x2015;<b><i>Naomi Alderman, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br></i></b><br><br>"In an alarming peek into a dystopian future, a group of women navigates family and motherhood in an America that has outlawed abortion, in vitro fertilization, and adoption by single women. Each of the interwoven story lines is complex and heartbreaking in its own way, and overall it's a fascinating and unsettling exploration of the limits society can place on women's bodies."&#x2015;<b><i>Samantha Irby, <i>Marie Claire</i><br></i></b><br><br>"The story is set in a small Oregon town in a future that Mike Pence can almost see if he stands on his pew...This provocative exploration of female longing, frustration and determination couldn't be more timely, and yet there's nothing fleeting about it. With <i>Red Clocks,</i> Zumas has written a novel that's political without being doctrinaire, that expands the dimensions of our most pressing social debate."&#x2015;<b><i>Ron Charles, <i>Washington Post</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Intricate and alarming, Leni Zumas' riveting second novel, <i>Red Clocks</i>, arrives just in time....Wry and urgent, defiant and stylish, Zumas' braided tale follows the intertwined fates of four women whose lives this law irrevocably alters....Lit up with verbal pyrotechnics and built with an admirably balanced structure, <i>Red Clocks </i>is undeniably gorgeously written.... Indispensable."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Chicago Tribune</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Zumas has written a work that's preoccupied with what it means to live inside a woman's body, and to exist in that body in a world that's long viewed it with fear and unease.... A thoughtful, complicated picture of womanhood-and a fierce argument for individual choice.... <i>Red Clocks</i> is relentlessly interrogative but always humane.... <i>Red Clocks</i> instead is deeply, intentionally personal. Rather than trafficking in sweeping generalizations or one-size-fits-all dictates, it focuses on the uniqueness of all of its characters, who are nevertheless linked by the immutability of their bodies. The familiarity of the book's world, just a step removed from our own reality, is the most shocking thing about it."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Atlantic</i></i></b><br><br>"An enchanting ramble through the myths and mundanities of womanhood.... "Red Clocks" ends up feeling like an enjoyable puzzle that is fundamentally unsolvable, some of its pieces playfully misplaced along the way. The fractured narrative leaves us to connect the dots between these disparate characters, all of whom make bleak compromises because they - like so many women throughout history - have so few options available to them."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Los Angeles Times</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Hilarious, terrifying, and masterful--this pitch-perfect, timely novel reflects the horror and absurdity of our political landscape with a brilliance that ensures the book's timelessness.

Original.</p><p>Bentley Little is a top craftsman of the horror tale in long form. He has the ability, more unusual than you might think, to imagine 300 to 400 pages' worth of horrific incidents that add up to a long-lasting and powerfully unsettling mood. In <i>The Store</i> Little examines the steadily expanding influence, over all of us, of chain stores. Listen to what one character says: "A lot of these loonies ... are so worried about the federal government, and I never saw a government agency that worked worth a damn. These guys're so afraid of Big Brother and creeping totalitarianism, but our government's always seemed to me to be full of inept bunglers, not brilliant organized master planners. Hell, they couldn't even pull off a third-rate burglary. It's the corporations we have to worry about, I think. They're the ones with the money. They're the ones who can afford to hire the best and the brightest, to competently carry out their plans."<p> <i>The Store</i> builds paranoia by starting with simple descriptions of the picturesque landscape and the deceptively banal Western town that is Juniper, Arizona. Then The Store arrives. The Store razes a lovely hill to build its huge parking lot. The Store offers well-paying jobs and an astonishing variety of consumer goods. The pattern of delight and worry in the citizens, as The Store spreads its tentacles into local concerns, is believable--disturbingly so. The Store seems like any other of the familiar chains that reproduce like rabbits, invade communities, wipe out small businesses, and turn unique localities into a generic America that looks just the same from Alaska to Florida. </p><p> But what exactly goes on, when Samantha and Shannon meet with their boss in the basement of The Store?

At Disney, they say it all began with a mouse. For me, at Chick-fil-A, it all began with a flat tire. When I began pursuing a job at Chick-fil-A, I knew very little about the company. I grew up in Atlanta eating Chick-fil-A every time we went to the mall and fell in love with the sandwich right from the start. My husband and I had our first date there when I was still in high school, and my mother and I had lunch at Chick-fil-A on my wedding day.</p><p>Soon after we were married, my husband was hired to be the pastor at a church down the road from the Chick-fil-A Home Office. Several young people in the youth group worked in the warehouse at Chick-fil-A and invited him to lunch at the office. Each time he went, he would tell me about the beautiful campus, the friendly people and the incredible culture. He soon began encouraging me to apply for a job at Chick-fil-A. After some coaxing, I finally did apply for a job in Marketing, since I was currently working in the advertising field. I filled out the twelve-page application and mailed it in to Human Resources. Two weeks later, I received my first rejection letter and I thought, "Well, that is that." Not as easily deterred, my husband continued to encourage me to follow up and apply again. I did and received a second rejection letter. By this time, I was becoming intrigued and had learned enough about Chick-fil-A to know that I was very interested, but not sure how I was going to even get an interview, much less be hired.</p><p>After about six months of follow-up phone calls, I was about ready to give up on the idea. One day, a woman came into the church and explained to my husband that she had a flat tire and needed to call for help. Instead, he gladly changed the tire for her. When he finished, she gave him a coupon (known as a Be Our Guest card) for a free Chick-fil-A sandwich. He quickly unearthed that she was an employee with Chick-fil-A, but had to resign because her husband was being relocated out of state. He asked her what department she worked in and she replied, "Advertising."</p><p>As soon as the woman left the church, my zealous husband quickly called me and informed me that Chick-fil-A had an opening in the advertising department-my specialty. I just as quickly picked up the phone and called the same sweet voice in Human Resources for the "umpteenth" time. I guess at this point, they decided I was not going away easily, and I was invited to come in to interview for the job. Similar to the three follow-up interviews I would have later, my first interview was an all-day visit. I met with members of the Human Resources staff and various members of the Marketing department. The longer I sat on the sofa in the reception area, the more my desire to work for Chick-fil-A grew. I was amazed at the friendliness of the people, especially as I compared it to the firm where I currently worked: what a stark contrast! As I waited for the next interview, the same kind receptionist who had answered all my many phone calls offered me coffee, soft drinks and juices from the break room that provided these free to employees. They took me to lunch in the company caf�, where lunch is provided to employees at no cost. I toured the fitness center, complete with full-sized racquetball court, and I reviewed the exhaustive list of benefits, including the opportunity to reserve one of Truett Cathy's Florida beach condos for a week at (you guessed it) no cost.</p><p>Perhaps most meaningful to me as I sat on the sofa in the reception area was the opportunity to meet members of the Cathy family and other company leaders as they exited the elevator on the fifth floor. On my second visit, I sat waiting and a gentleman walked up and introduced himself.</p><p>"I am Truett Cathy. Thank you for visiting today."</p><p>Thirty years later, we still try to communicate that same level of personal care to our candidates as we get to know each other. Eventually, after about four months of interviewing, checking references and skill testing, I made it to my final interview. Along the way, I also had been given the opportunity to consider a position within Human Resources as well as in Marketing. It was a tough decision between the two roles and the two departments; I had no idea at the time that this decision would determine the course of my career for decades. Advertising was truly my first love, but I was curious about a different role and a change of pace. My plan was to begin my career in Human Resources and make a move to Marketing within a couple of years. Obviously, that move has not yet occurred, even thirty years later.</p><p>This final interview was with Jimmy Collins, who, at the time, was Executive Vice President. Only recently had Jimmy taken over from Truett the responsibility of final hiring interviews. Because Truett believed that decisions about people were the most important decisions, he made sure he was included in the selection process for both staff and restaurant Operators. Once Jimmy received these new responsibilities, the interviews continued to be challenging! He also took great care with those decisions and noticed every detail. He was thoughtful and intense. He was also observant. Were the applicant's shoes new or shined? Did the candidate wear a watch? Were all the statements in the application true? To Jimmy, new or shined shoes made a statement about professionalism and how much the candidate cared about getting the job. A watch signaled someone who was aware of time, had places to go and made promptness a habit. He was a fact checker on the application. Any slight embellishment or untruth indicated an integrity issue. I remember the question that he asked me that caused me to pause and wonder if I would not get the job: "Are you a perfectionist?" I responded that I believed that I was. He said, "Are the shoes in your closet in order?" When he asked that question, I knew that I was not truly a perfectionist! Jimmy ended my interview by telling me it was his responsibility to talk me out of the job. I was completely surprised.</p><p>Why would the potential employer try to talk the candidate out of the job? He told me much of Chick-fil-A's success was based on long-term relationships . . . and employment was one of those long-term relationships. He said that if I could be talked out of this decision today, it would be better than in six months or a year when I chose to resign my job, impact my family and make other changes. To this day, I continue to have this conversation with every candidate. It's an important question. Of course, at the time, in my youth, I was thinking to myself, "Are you kidding me? After this four-month interviewing process and hours sitting on the reception sofa, I am absolutely sure I want this job." Actually, that is almost verbatim what I said to Jimmy.</p><p>Late in the day on an October evening, I returned to the vice president's office (which is actually my office now) and accepted the lateral offer to leave my company and join Chick-fil-A. I thought it would be a wonderful place to work for a few years until we decided to start our family. Then, I would stay home with my children and be the pastor's wife. Destiny is a funny thing. That night, I stood at the railing of the atrium, the very place I often stand today, to reflect on the five floors below and the career I saw ahead of me. I can still re-create the excitement that I had inside of me that night I was hired. I knew I had just become a part of something truly special. There was no possible way at such a young age and so inexperienced at life that I could, in any way, imagine the opportunities that were about to come my way. However, that was the beginning of a journey that shaped my entire adult life. The relationships, business knowledge, experiences and life lessons to follow have been nothing short of remarkable. And, to think, it all started with a flat tire.</p></p><h2>Do-It-Yourself Housebuilding: The Complete Handbook</h2><p>&#x201c;Clearly written text is complemented by nearly 1,800 illustrations as well as a solid index.

Here is a firsthand account of the supply effort that led to the dramatic Allied victory in the Gulf, written by the general who spearheaded the remarkable undertaking. General Pagonis recounts the Gulf War from the first fateful telephone call, to the mobilization of 550,000 troops and the shipment of 7,000,000 tons of supplies, to the enormously complex challenge of bringing home a half million soldiers and their equipment. Numerous leadership and logistics lessons can be gleaned from his experience. Pagonis describes his battlefield innovations as well as his inspirational leadership style. Using historical examples and current business practice, he makes a strong case for better leadership and better logistics, both in the military and in the private sector. In the Gulf War, leadership and logistics came together, and extraordinary goals were achieved. Pagonis demonstrated what senior managers of world-class companies now recognize: good logistics is an important source of competitive advantage. &#34;Moving Mountains&#34; offers lessons for all organizations facing major operational challenges.</p><p>Jeffrey L. Cruikshank is a cofounder of Kohn-Cruikshank, Inc., a Boston-based communications consulting firm. He has written or cowritten a number of business-related books, including the bestselling Do Lunch or Be Lunch, and was a coauthor with David Sicilia of The Little Engine That Could.Traditionally the most unglamorous and under-appreciated facet of the military, logistics comprises transportation; oil and fuel management; food, water and ammunition supply; and many other day-to-day needs that must be met before an army can fight. U.S. Army Lieutenant-General Pagonis presents a definitive case study of modern logistics in the context of the Gulf war. With unprecedented speed and efficiency, Pagonis's 22nd Support Command moved nearly 500,000 soldiers and seven million tons of supplies halfway around the world, a feat that General H. Norman Schwarzkopf called "absolutely gigantic." Here Pagonis provides a virtual textbook of logistical problem-solving in such arcane areas as organizing recreational activities for several thousand men and women under the host-nation's severe religious and social constraints, as well as such conventional problems as whether to construct an overpass at the Mother of all Intersections. Pagonis makes many useful comments, of interest to the private business sector, about time management, delegation of authority and boss-to-staff communications.

In <i>An Hour Before Daylight</i>, the former president tells the story of his rural boyhood, and paints a sensitive portrait of America before the civil rights movement.<p> Carter describes--in glorious, if sometimes gory, detail--growing up on a farm where everything was done by either hand or mule: plowing fields, "mopping" cotton to kill pests, cutting sugar cane, shaking peanuts, or processing pork. He also describes the joys of walking barefoot ("this habit alone helped to create a sense of intimacy with the earth"), taking naps with his father on the porch after lunch, and hunting with slingshots and boomerangs with his playmates--all of whom were black. Carter was in constant contact with his black neighbors; he worked alongside them, ate in their homes, and often spent the night in the home of Rachel and Jack Clark, "on a pallet on the floor stuffed with corn shucks," when his parents were away. However, this intimacy was possible only on the farm. When young Jimmy and his best friend, A.D. Davis, went to town to see a movie, they waited for the train together, paid their 15 cents, and then separated into "white" and "colored" compartments. Once in Americus, they walked to the theater together, but separated again, with Jimmy buying a seat on the main floor or first balcony at the front door, and A.D. going around to the back door to buy his seat up in the upper balcony. After the movie, they returned home on another segregated train. "I don't remember ever questioning the mandatory racial separation, which we accepted like breathing or waking up in Archery every morning."</p><p> In this warm, almost sepia-toned narrative, Carter describes his relationships with his parents and with the five people--only two of whom were white--who most affected his early life. Best of all, however, Carter presents his sweetly nostalgic recollections of a lost America. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><b>Jimmy Carter</b> was born in Plains, Georgia, and served as thirty-ninth President of the United States.

After earning a law degree in 1906, he worked for most of his adult life at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute in Prague.

He left instructions for his friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy all of his unpublished work after his death, instructions Brod famously ignored.<i>[April 1920]<br>Meran-�Untermais, Pension Ottoburg</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena<br><br>The rain which has been going on for two days and one night has just now stopped, of course probably only temporarily, but nonetheless an event worth celebrating, which I am doing by writing to you. Incidentally the rain itself was bearable; after all, it is a foreign country here, admittedly only slightly foreign, but it does the heart good. If my impression was correct (evidently the memory of one single meeting, brief and half-�silent, is not to be exhausted), you were also enjoying Vienna as a foreign city, although later circumstances may have diminished this enjoyment, but do you also enjoy foreignness for its own sake? (Which might be a bad sign by the way, a sign that such enjoyment should not exist.)<br><br>I&#x2019;m living quite well here, the mortal body could hardly stand more care, the balcony outside my room is sunk into a garden, overgrown and covered with blooming bushes (the vegetation here is strange; in weather cold enough to make the puddles freeze in Prague, blossoms are slowly unfolding before my balcony), moreover this garden receives full sun (or full cloud, as it has for al- most a week)&#x2014;�lizards and birds, unlikely couples, come visit me: I would very much like to share Meran with you, recently you wrote about not being able to breathe, that image and its meaning are very close to one another and here both would find a little relief.<br><br>With cordial greetings,<br>F Kafka<br><br>***<br><i>[April 1920]<br>Meran-�Untermais, Pension Ottoburg</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena<br><br>I wrote you a note from Prague and then from Meran. I have not received any answer. It so happens the notes did not require a particularly prompt reply and if your silence is nothing more than a sign of relative well-�being, which often expresses itself in an aversion to writing, then I am completely satisfied. However, it is also possible&#x2014;�and this is why I am writing&#x2014;�that in my notes I somehow hurt you (what a clumsy hand I must have had, if that should have happened against all my intentions) or else, which would of course be much worse, the moment of quiet relaxation you described has again passed and bad times have again descended upon you. In case the first is true I don&#x2019;t know what to say, that&#x2019;s so far from my thoughts and everything else is so close, and for the second possibility I have no advice&#x2014;�how could I?&#x2014;�but just a simple question: Why don&#x2019;t you leave Vienna for a little while? After all, you aren&#x2019;t homeless like other people. Wouldn&#x2019;t some time in Bohemia give you new strength? And if, for reasons unknown to me, you might not want to go to Bohemia, then somewhere else, maybe even Meran would be good. Do you know it?<br><br>So I&#x2019;m expecting one of two things. Either continued silence, which means: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Or else a few lines.<br><br>Cordially Kafka<br><br><i>It occurs to me that I �really can&#x2019;t remember your face in any precise detail.

Somehow I am both moved and ashamed. You will have probably already received a letter from Wolff, at least he wrote to me some time ago concerning such a letter. I did not write any novella entitled &#x201c;Murderers&#x201d; (although this was apparently advertised in a catalog)&#x2014;�there is some misunderstanding, but since it&#x2019;s supposed to be the best one of the lot maybe it&#x2019;s mine after all.<br><br>Judging from your last two letters anxiety and worry seem to have left you once and for all, this probably applies to your husband as well, how much I wish it for both of you. I recall a Sunday afternoon years ago, I was creeping along the wall of houses on the Franzensquai and ran into your husband, heading �toward me in much the same way&#x2014;�two headache experts, naturally each after his very own fashion. I don&#x2019;t remember whether we then went on together or passed each other by, the difference between these two possibilities could not have been very great. But that is past and should remain deep in the past. Is it nice at home?<br><br>Cordial greetings<br>Kafka<br><br>***<br><i>[Meran, April 1920]</i><br><br>So it&#x2019;s the lung. I&#x2019;ve been turning it over in my mind all day long, unable to think of anything else. Not that it alarms me; probably and hopefully&#x2014;�you seem to indicate as much&#x2014;�you have a mild case, and even full-�fledged pulmonary disease (half of western Europe has more or less deficient lungs), as I have known in myself for 3 years, has brought me more good things than bad. In my case it began about 3 years ago with a violent hemorrhage in the middle of the night. I was excited as one always is by something new, naturally somewhat frightened as well; I got up (instead of staying in bed, which is the prescribed treatment as I later discovered), went to the window, leaned out, went to the washstand, walked around the room, sat down on the bed&#x2014;�no end to the blood. But I wasn&#x2019;t at all unhappy, since by and by I realized that for the first time in 3, 4 practically sleepless years there was a clear reason for me to sleep, provided the bleeding would stop. It did indeed stop (and has not returned since) and I slept through the rest of the night. To be sure, the next morning the maid showed up (at that time I had an apartment in the Sch�nborn-�Palais), a good, totally devoted but extremely frank girl, she saw the blood and said: &#x201c;Pane doktore, you&#x2019;re not going to last very long.&#x201d; But I was feeling better than usual, I went to the office and did not go see the doctor until later that afternoon. The rest of the story is immaterial. I only wanted to say: it&#x2019;s not your illness which scares me (especially since I keep interrupting myself to search my memory, and underneath all your fragility I perceive something like a farm girl&#x2019;s vigor and I conclude: no, you&#x2019;re not sick, this is a warning but no disease of the lung), anyway it&#x2019;s not that which scares me, but the thought of what must have preceded this disturbance. For the moment, I&#x2019;m simply ignoring everything else in your letter, such as: not a heller&#x2014;�tea and apple&#x2014;�daily from 2 to 8&#x2014;�these are things I cannot understand which evidently require oral explanation. So I&#x2019;ll ignore all that (though only in this letter, as I cannot forget them) and just recall the explanation I applied to my own case back then and which fits many cases. You see, my brain was no longer able to bear the pain and anxiety with which it had been burdened. It said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m giving up; but if anyone else here cares about keeping the whole intact, then he should share the load and things will run a little longer.&#x201d; Whereupon my lung volunteered, it probably didn&#x2019;t have much to lose anyway. These negotiations between brain and lung, which went on without my knowledge, may well have been quite terrifying.<br><br>And what are you going to do now? The fact that you&#x2019;re being looked after is probably insignificant. Anyone who cares about you has to realize that you need a little looking after, nothing else �really matters. So is there salvation here as well? I said already&#x2014;�no, I&#x2019;m not in the mood for making jokes, I am not being funny in the least and will not be funny again until you have written how you are planning a new and healthier way of life. After your last letter I&#x2019;m not going to ask why you don&#x2019;t leave Vienna for a while, now I understand, but after all there are beautiful places close to Vienna as well, which offer many different cures and possibilities of care. Today I&#x2019;m not going to write about anything else, I don&#x2019;t have anything more important to bring up. I&#x2019;m saving everything else for tomorrow, including my thanks for the issue of Kmen which makes me moved and ashamed, happy and sad. No, there is one other thing: If you waste as much as one minute of your sleep on the translation, it will be as if you were cursing me. For if it ever comes to a trial there will be no further investigations; they will simply establish the fact: he robbed her of her sleep. With that I shall be condemned, and justly so. Thus I&#x2019;m fighting for myself when I ask you to stop.<br><br>Franz<br><br>***<br><i>[Meran, end of April 1920]</i><br><br>Dear Frau Milena, today I&#x2019;d like to write about something else but can&#x2019;t. Not that this �really bothers me; if it did then I would write something else, but now and then a deck chair �really should be ready for you somewhere in the garden, half in the shade, with about 10 glasses of milk within easy reach. It might even be in Vienna, even now in the summer&#x2014;�but without hunger and in peace. Is this impossible? And is there no one to make it possible? And what does the doctor say?<br><br>When I pulled your translation out of the large envelope, I was almost disappointed. I wanted to hear from you and not the voice from the old grave, the voice I know all too well. Why did it have to come between us? Then I realized that this same voice had also come between us, as a mediator. But apart from that it is inconceivable to me that you would take on such a troublesome task, and I am moved by your faithfulness �toward every little sentence, a faithfulness I would not have thought possible to achieve in Czech, let alone with the beautiful natural authority you attain. German and Czech so close to each other? But however that may be, the story is in any case abysmally bad, which I could prove to you, dear Frau Milena, with unparalleled ease, except that my disgust would outweigh the evidence. Naturally the fact that you like the story gives it some value, although it also makes my view of the world a little dimmer. No more about that. Wolff will send you the Country Doctor, I have written to him.<br><br>Of course I understand Czech. I&#x2019;ve meant to ask you several times already why you never write in Czech. Not to imply that your command of German leaves anything to be desired. Most of the time it is amazing and on those occasions when it does falter, the German language becomes pliant just for you, of its own accord, and then it is particularly beautiful, something a German doesn&#x2019;t even dare hope for; a German wouldn&#x2019;t dare write so personally. But I wanted to read you in Czech because, after all, you do belong to that language, because only there can Milena be found in her entirety (the translation confirms this), whereas here there is only the Milena from Vienna or the Milena preparing for Vienna. So Czech, please. And also the feuilletons you mentioned. Even if they are shabby, after all, you managed to read through the shabbiness of my story&#x2014;�how far I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe I can do the same; however, if I can&#x2019;t make it through to the end at least I&#x2019;ll get stuck in the best possible prejudice.<br><br>You ask about my engagement. I was engaged twice (or actually three times, twice to the same girl), so three times I have been separated from marriage by only a few days. The first is completely over (I hear there&#x2019;s already a new marriage and even a small boy), the second is still alive although without any prospect of marriage, so it �really isn&#x2019;t alive or rather it&#x2019;s living an independent life at the cost of the people involved. On the whole I have found here and elsewhere that men may suffer more, or if you prefer, they have less resistance in these matters; women, however, always suffer without guilt and not just because they &#x201c;can&#x2019;t do anything about it&#x201d; but in the strictest sense of the word, which may nonetheless lead to the &#x201c;can&#x2019;t do anything about it.&#x201d; Incidentally, brooding over these things is useless. It&#x2019;s like trying to smash a single cauldron in hell; first, the enterprise won&#x2019;t succeed, and second, if it does succeed, one will be consumed by the glowing effluent, while hell remains intact in all its glory. The problem must be approached differently.<br><br>In any case the first thing is to lie down in a garden and extract as much sweetness as possible from the ailment, especially if it&#x2019;s not a genuine disease. There&#x2019;s a lot of sweetness in that<br><br>Franz K.</p><h2>The Sonnets (The Pelican Shakespeare)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series edited by A. R.

Unlike many other programs that simply focus on how many pounds are lost on the scale, SHRED also improves other health factors, such as reducing risk for high blood pressure, decreasing the risk for diabetes, and improving energy levels. With so many programs available it is reasonable to ask why one would choose SHRED over another popular diet. The answer is simple. SHRED allows you to eat normal food that&#x2019;s inexpensive. It is extremely simple to understand, and it does not require perfection for you to find success. Another important aspect that many SHREDDERs have liked is that the diet can be customized based on the results you&#x2019;re looking for or any dietary preferences you might have. You will find that making substitutions while SHREDDING is not only allowed but encouraged, as it will not impede your success in any way.<br>There are many programs that can help you lose weight, but there are few that combine the appropriate balance of challenging you while at the same time not making it too difficult to follow for the long term. One major problem with many diet plans is that while they can help users lose weight, they are so extreme, difficult, or uncomfortable that dieters are unable to follow the guidelines for an extended period of time. The second you stop following the plan, the pounds that were lost pile back on with a vengeance, and often, then some. This is not the case with SHRED. The vast majority of those surveyed who tried the early versions of the program repeatedly commented that unlike other plans they had tried, SHRED was one they could see themselves following forever.<br>There are many principles at work in SHRED that lead to the tremendous success that so many experience. Ease of use is at the top of the list: each day is thoughtfully planned out so that your need to think about what works and what doesn&#x2019;t is kept to a minimum. Ironically, many who have been asked about programs that give them the greatest level of flexibility in choosing the foods they can eat say that too much flexibility can actually make the diet more difficult. It&#x2019;s a struggle to have so many choices in front of them. SHRED spells out in detail each meal you will consume for six weeks, but it also gives you plenty of room to make substitutions so that you can swap out meals if you like.<br>SHRED is a six-week program. You may well stay on SHRED for more than six weeks, but each six weeks is considered to be a cycle. Based on the hundreds of SHREDDERs who have tried the program and provided feedback, the average weight loss for a cycle is between 18 and 25 pounds. Results, as with any diet program, will vary from person to person for various reasons, but more than with any diet I&#x2019;ve developed or been aware of, what has been amazingly satisfying is how consistent the weight loss has been. Ninety-three percent of the people who have been on the program have lost weight each week of the cycle. Even better, many who had been using other diet plans and had hit a plateau found that just a <i>week</i> on SHRED got them losing weight again.<br>In general, those who are closer to their target weight will definitely lose weight but tend to lose weight a little more slowly. This is to be expected, so if you fall into this category, don&#x2019;t be disappointed if you don&#x2019;t see the numbers on the scale drop quickly or significantly at first. Look for any progress, whether it be increased energy or losing inches. However, those who have more than 30 pounds to lose will typically start seeing results right away. The average results on SHRED are 6-4-2. In six weeks most people who closely follow the program lose four inches and two sizes.<br>Once you have completed an initial six-week cycle, if you still have more weight to lose, the program is designed for you to cycle again. After the first cycle, you can reorder the weeks of a new cycle in any fashion that works best for you. This is only one way in which SHRED can be customized to fit your needs. I recognize that there&#x2019;s no such thing as &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; when it comes to diet plans, but SHRED comes close.<br>SHRED CYCLES<br>Each week of SHRED is designed to stand on its own and to be different from the weeks before. Each of the six weeks has a name that reflects the theme for that week. The weeks are Prime, Challenge, Transformation, Ascend, Cleanse, and Explode. While each week represents a leg in your journey, it also builds on those that precede it. The program teaches you how to make smarter choices and has specific strategies embedded in the daily meal and exercise plans: sometimes you will recognize them and other times you will not. The overall effect, however, is that you will continuously SHRED fat. You will see the declining numbers on the scale and a reduction in inches wherever you need to lose them: whether it be in your waist, thighs, or hips.<br>It has been my experience that programs that start out asking followers to make extreme changes in their dietary and/or exercise habits are least effective over the long term. Users either can never fully engage the program, because it&#x2019;s asking too much of them, or they are able to do some of the program but not all of it, leading them to become discouraged and drop out altogether. SHRED acknowledges some very basic facts. First, losing weight is not easy and quite often is extremely frustrating. Second, no one is a perfect eater or exerciser and expecting someone&#x2014;anyone&#x2014;to be perfect and not have bad days is completely unrealistic. Third, success comes from following a program that one can ease into, rather than a program that starts out too aggressively rigorous and restrictive. People don&#x2019;t always want to feel like they&#x2019;re on a diet!<br>Prime. These seven days prime you for the rest of the plan. This week is an induction into SHREDDER Nation. You&#x2019;ll learn about the importance of meal spacing, proper snacking techniques, and suppressing hunger without consuming too many calories. The average weight loss this week will be 3.5 pounds. This could be less if you&#x2019;re within 20 pounds of your goal weight. The further you are away from your target weight and the worse your habits have been prior to starting the program, the more weight you will lose. Many who fit this description have lost as much as 8 to 10 pounds during Prime. One hundred percent of the people who have been on the program&#x2014;regardless of how much weight they needed to lose&#x2014;answered in their survey that they had enough to eat, some going so far as to say that there was <i>so</i> much food they couldn&#x2019;t manage to eat everything on the daily menus.<br>Challenge is a week that asks you to demand more of yourself. It asks you to release some of your bad habits and adopt some new behaviors that you will have for the rest of your life. This week says that you can do better: you&#x2019;ll learn after a couple of days that despite early doubts you might have about yourself, you actually can rise to the challenge. This week is a confidence booster, because it shows many dieters that despite their failures in the past or what they have previously perceived to be difficult, they actually have what it takes to succeed. At the end of the Challenge you will be motivated more than ever to truly make a commitment to a healthier lifestyle and to reach the goals you have set forth prior to starting your SHRED.<br>Transformation week is a critical seven days where most SHREDDERs start truly noticing a difference. Not only will the scale reflect your hard work, but many realize for the first time at the end of this week that they have dropped a clothing size, their energy levels are much greater, and their outlook about their success on the program heightens dramatically. Transformation is designed to be the toughest week of the program. You will be challenged the most during this week, but it&#x2019;s nothing you can&#x2019;t handle. Knowing this week is the toughest is half the battle. The other half is putting your head down and getting through it. If you focus, this week will be your best friend. Every day visualize the fat being SHREDDED and your body&#x2019;s appearance changing.<br>Ascend is an important turnaround week. Imagine that for the last three weeks you have been descending into a pit. Last week you finally reached the bottom and started to regain strength so that you can climb your way out. The seven days of Ascend have been specifically constructed so that you are now exiting the darkness and ascending toward the light. You have already completed the toughest week of the program, so Ascend will come as a relief. You will continue to work hard, but the work will not feel as strenuous as it did the week before. Reinvigorated after three weeks on the program, you are now energized to finish the rest of the cycle at full speed.<br>Cleanse is a week that pays special attention to enhancing your liver&#x2019;s ability to detoxify your blood. All of us&#x2014;even those who eat as healthfully as possible&#x2014;accumulate some level of toxins in our bodies. We want to eliminate these toxins as efficiently as possible. Sometimes livers can be overwhelmed, so occasionally it&#x2019;s beneficial to give them a little boost in carrying out their jobs. Certain foods can provide this boost by activating special enzymes in the liver that facilitate the cleansing process. There are also foods that work to increase the activity of the gastrointestinal tract. This creates a physical cleanse. This week you will do both. Not only will you improve your physical health this week, but you will continue your weight loss: some will lose their largest amounts during these seven days.<br>Explode is the last week of the cycle. It&#x2019;s meant to help you end the cycle with a bang. For some, this week will be their last and they will have reached their goal. For others, Explode is a launch...</p><h2>The Creative Curriculum for Preschool Volume 5 -Objectives for Development &amp; Learning -Birth Through Kindergarten *PAPERBACK</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness</h2><p><b>A gripping memoir and medical suspense story about a young <i>New York Post</i> reporter&#x2019;s struggle with a rare and terrifying disease, opening a<i> </i>new window into the fascinating world of brain science.<i></i></b><br><br>One day in 2009, twenty-four-year-old Susannah Cahalan woke up alone in a strange hospital room, strapped to her bed, under guard, and unable to move or speak. A wristband marked her as a &#x201c;flight risk,&#x201d; and her medical records&#x2014;chronicling a month-long hospital stay of which she had no memory at all&#x2014;showed hallucinations, violence, and dangerous instability. Only weeks earlier, Susannah had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: a healthy, ambitious college grad a few months into her first serious relationship and a promising career as a cub reporter at a major New York newspaper. Who was the stranger who had taken over her body? What was happening to her mind? <br><br>In this swift and breathtaking narrative, Susannah tells the astonishing true story of her inexplicable descent into madness and the brilliant, lifesaving diagnosis that nearly didn&#x2019;t happen. A team of doctors would spend a month&#x2014;and more than a million dollars&#x2014;trying desperately to pin down a medical explanation for what had gone wrong. Meanwhile, as the days passed and her family, boyfriend, and friends helplessly stood watch by her bed, she began to move inexorably through psychosis into catatonia and, ultimately, toward death. Yet even as this period nearly tore her family apart, it offered an extraordinary testament to their faith in Susannah and their refusal to let her go. <br><br>Then, at the last minute, celebrated neurologist Souhel Najjar joined her team and, with the help of a lucky, ingenious test, saved her life. He recognized the symptoms of a newly discovered autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks the brain, a disease now thought to be tied to both schizophrenia and autism, and perhaps the root of &#x201c;demonic possessions&#x201d; throughout history. <br><br>Far more than simply a riveting read and a crackling medical mystery, <i>Brain on Fire </i>is the powerful account of one woman&#x2019;s struggle to recapture her identity and to rediscover herself among the fragments left behind. Using all her considerable journalistic skills, and building from hospital records and surveillance video, interviews with family and friends, and excerpts from the deeply moving journal her father kept during her illness, Susannah pieces together the story of her &#x201c;lost month&#x201d; to write an unforgettable memoir about memory and identity, faith and love. It is an important, profoundly compelling tale of survival and perseverance that is destined to become a classic.</p><p>Susannah Cahalan is a news reporter at the <i>New York Post</i> whose award-winning work has also been featured in <i>The New York Times</i>. She lives in Jersey City, New Jersey.Brain on Fire CHAPTER 1<p></p> BEDBUG BLUES<p></p> <br>Maybe it all began with a bug bite, from a bedbug that didn&#x2019;t exist.<br> <br>One morning, I&#x2019;d woken up to find two red dots on the main purplish-blue vein running down my left arm. It was early 2009, and New York City was awash in bedbug scares: they infested offices, clothing stores, movie theaters, and park benches. Though I wasn&#x2019;t naturally a worrier, my dreams had been occupied for two nights straight by finger-long bedbugs. It was a reasonable concern, though after carefully scouring the apartment, I couldn&#x2019;t find a single bug or any evidence of their presence. Except those two bites. I even called in an exterminator to check out my apartment, an overworked Hispanic man who combed the whole place, lifting up my sofa bed and shining a flashlight into places I had never before thought to clean. He proclaimed my studio bug free. That seemed unlikely, so I asked for a follow-up appointment for him to spray. To his credit, he urged me to wait before shelling out an astronomical sum to do battle against what he seemed to think was an imaginary infestation. But I pressed him to do it, convinced that my apartment, my bed, my body had been overrun by bugs. He agreed to return and exterminate.<br> <br>Concerned as I was, I tried to conceal my growing unease from my coworkers. Understandably, no one wanted to be associated with a person with a bedbug problem. So at work the following day, I walked as nonchalantly as possible through the newsroom of the New York Post to my cubicle. I was careful to conceal my bites and tried to appear casual, normal. Not that &#x201c;normal&#x201d; means a lot at the Post.<br> <br>Though it&#x2019;s notoriously obsessed with what&#x2019;s new, the Post is nearly as old as the nation itself. Established by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, it is the longest continually run newspaper in the country. In its first century alone, the paper crusaded for the abolition movement and helped promote the creation of Central Park. Today the newsroom itself is cavernous yet airless, filled with rows of open cubicles and a glut of filing cabinets packed with decades of unused, forgotten documents. The walls are freckled with clocks that don&#x2019;t run, dead flowers hung upside down to dry, a picture of a monkey riding a border collie, and a big foam Six Flags finger, all memorabilia from reporters&#x2019; assignments. The PCs are ancient, the copy machines the size of small ponies. A small utility closet that once served as a smoking room now holds supplies, and is marked by a weathered sign warning that the smoking room no longer exists, as if someone might accidentally wander in for a cigarette among the monitors and video equipment. This has been my eccentric little world for the past seven years, since I started here as a seventeen-year-old intern.<br> <br>Especially around deadline, the room buzzes with activity&#x2014;keyboards clacking, editors yelling, reporters cackling&#x2014;the perfect stereotype of a tabloid newsroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the fucking picture to go with this caption?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How is it that he didn&#x2019;t know she was a prostitute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What color were the socks of the guy who jumped off the bridge?&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s like a bar without alcohol, filled with adrenaline-soaked news junkies. The cast of characters here is unique to the Post: the brightest headline writers in the business, the hardened newshounds hunting after exclusives, and type-A workaholics who possess the chameleon ability to either befriend or antagonize almost anyone. Still, on most days, the newsroom is subdued, as everyone silently combs through court documents, interviews sources, or reads newspapers. Often, like today, the newsroom is as quiet as a morgue.<br> <br>Heading toward my desk to start the day, I wove through the rows of cubicles marked by green Manhattan street signs: Liberty Street, Nassau Street, Pine Street, and William Street, throwbacks to a time when the Post was actually flanked by those downtown streets in its previous home at the South Street Seaport. My desk is at Pine Street. Amid the silence, I slid into my seat beside Angela, my closest friend at the paper, and gave her a tense smile. Trying not to let my question echo too loudly across the noiseless room, I asked, &#x201c;You know anything about bedbug bites?&#x201d;<br> <br>I often joked that if I ever had a daughter, I&#x2019;d want her to be like Angela. In many ways, she is my newsroom hero. When I first met her, three years before, she was a soft-spoken, shy young woman from Queens, only a few years older than me. She had arrived at the Post from a small weekly paper and since then had matured under the pressure of a big-city tabloid into one of the Post&#x2019;s most talented reporters, churning out reams of our best stories. Most late Friday nights, you&#x2019;d find Angela writing four stories on split screens simultaneously. I couldn&#x2019;t help but look up to her. Now I really needed her advice.<br> <br>Hearing that dreaded word, bedbugs, Angela scooted her chair away from mine. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you have them,&#x201d; she said with an impish smile. I started to show her my arm, but before I could get into my tale of woe, my phone rang.<br> <br>&#x201c;You ready?&#x201d; It was the new Sunday editor, Steve. He was just barely in his midthirties, yet he had already been named head editor of the Sunday paper, the section I worked for, and despite his friendliness, he intimidated me. Every Tuesday, each reporter had a pitch meeting to showcase some of his or her ideas for that Sunday&#x2019;s paper. At the sound of his voice, I realized with panic that I was completely unprepared for this week&#x2019;s meeting. Usually I had at least three coherent ideas to pitch; they weren&#x2019;t always great, but I always had something. Now I had nothing, not even enough to bluff my way through the next five minutes. How had I let that happen? This meeting was impossible to forget, a weekly ritual that we all fastidiously prepared for, even during days off.<br> <br>Bedbugs forgotten, I widened my eyes at Angela as I stood back up, gamely hoping it all would work out once I got to Steve&#x2019;s office.<br> <br>Nervously, I walked back down &#x201c;Pine Street&#x201d; and into Steve&#x2019;s office. I sat down next to Paul, the Sunday news editor and close friend who had mentored me since I was a sophomore in college, giving him a nod but avoiding direct eye contact. I readjusted my scratched-up wide-framed Annie Hall glasses, which a publicist friend once described as my own form of birth control because &#x201c;no one will sleep with you with those on.&#x201d;<br> <br>We sat there in silence for a moment, as I tried to let myself be comforted by Paul&#x2019;s familiar, larger-than-life presence. With his shock of prematurely white hair and his propensity to toss the word fuck around like a preposition, he is the essence of a throwback newsman and a brilliant editor.<br> <br>He had given me a shot as a reporter during the summer of my sophomore year of college after a family friend introduced us. After a few years in which I worked as a runner, covering breaking news and feeding information to another reporter to write the piece, Paul offered me my first big assignment: an article on the debauchery at a New York University fraternity house. When I returned with a story and pictures of me playing beer pong, he was impressed with my chutzpah; even though the expos� never ran, he assigned me more stories until I had been hired on full time in 2008. Now, as I sat in Steve&#x2019;s office wholly unprepared, I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel like a work in progress, not worthy of Paul&#x2019;s faith and respect.<br> <br>The silence deepened until I looked up. Steve and Paul were staring at me expectantly, so I just started talking, hoping something would come. &#x201c;I saw this story on a blog&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; I said, desperately plucking up wisps of half-formed ideas.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s really just not good enough,&#x201d; Steve interrupted. &#x201c;You need to be bringing in better stuff than this. Okay? Please don&#x2019;t come in with nothing again.&#x201d; Paul nodded, his face blazing red. For the first time since I&#x2019;d started working on my high school newspaper, journalism disagreed with me. I left the meeting furious at myself and bewildered by my own ineptitude.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Angela asked as I returned to my desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you know, I&#x2019;m just bad at my job. No big deal,&#x201d; I joked grimly.<br> <br>She laughed, revealing a few charmingly crooked incisor teeth. &#x201c;Oh, come on, Susannah. What happened? Don&#x2019;t take it seriously. You&#x2019;re a pro.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Ang,&#x201d; I said, sipping my lukewarm coffee. &#x201c;Things just aren&#x2019;t going my way.&#x201d;<br> <br>I brooded over the day&#x2019;s disasters that evening as I walked west from the News Corp. building on Sixth Avenue, through the tourist clusterfuck that is Times Square, toward my apartment in Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen. As if purposely living the clich� of a New York writer, I rented a cramped one-room studio, where I slept on a pullout sofa. The apartment, eerily quiet, overlooked the courtyard of several tenements, and I often awoke not to police sirens and grumbling garbage trucks but to the sound of a neighbor playing the accordion on his balcony.<br> <br>Still obsessed with my bites, despite the exterminator&#x2019;s assurance that I had nothing to worry about, I prepared for him to spray the place and spent that night discarding things that could be harboring bedbugs. Into the garbage went my beloved Post clips, hundreds of articles reminding me of how bizarre my job is: the victims and suspects, dangerous slums, prisons and hospitals, twelve-hour shifts spent shivering inside photographers&#x2019; cars waiting to photograph&#x2014;or &#x201c;pop&#x201d;&#x2014;celebrities. I had always loved every minute of it. So why was I suddenly so terrible at it?<br> <br>As I shoved these treasures into the trash bags, I paused on a few headlines, among them the biggest story of my career to date: the time I managed to land an exclusive jailhouse interview with child kidnapper Michael Devlin. The national media were hot on the story, and I was only a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, yet Devlin spoke to me twice. But the story didn&#x2019;t end there. His lawyers went nuts after the article ran, launching a smear campaign against the Post and calling for a judicial gag order, while the local and national media began debating my methods on live TV and questioning the ethics of jailhouse interviews and tabloids in general. Paul fielded several tearful phone calls from me during that time, which bound us together, and in the end, both the paper and my editors stood by me. Though the experience had rattled me, it also whetted my appetite, and from then on, I became the resident &#x201c;jailhouser.&#x201d; Devlin was eventually sentenced to three consecutive lifetimes in prison.<br> <br>Then there was the butt implant story, &#x201c;Rear and Present Danger,&#x201d; a headline that still makes me laugh. I had to go undercover as a stripper looking for cheap butt enhancements from a woman who was illegally dispensing them out of a midtown hotel room. As I stood there with my pants around my ankles, I tried not to be insulted when she announced that she would need &#x201c;a thousand dollars per cheek,&#x201d; twice the amount she charged the woman who had come forward to the Post.<br> <br>Journalism was thrilling; I had always loved living a reality that was more fabulist than fiction, though little did I know that my life was about to become so bizarre as to be worthy of coverage in my own beloved tabloid.<br> <br>Even though the memory made me smile, I added this clip to the growing trash pile&#x2014;&#x201c;where it belongs,&#x201d; I scoffed, despite the fact that those crazy stories had meant the world to me. Though it felt necessary at the moment, this callous throwing away of years&#x2019; worth of work was completely out of character for me. I was a nostalgic pack rat, who held on to poems that I had written in fourth grade and twenty-some-odd diaries that dated back to junior high. Though there didn&#x2019;t seem to be much of a connection among my bedbug scare, my forgetfulness at work, and my sudden instinct to purge my files, what I didn&#x2019;t know then is that bug obsession can be a sign of psychosis. It&#x2019;s a little-known problem, since those suffering from parasitosis, or Ekbom syndrome, as it&#x2019;s called, are most likely to consult exterminators or dermatologists for their imaginary infestations instead of mental health professionals, and as a result they frequently go undiagnosed. My problem, it turns out, was far vaster than an itchy forearm and a forgotten meeting.<br> <br>After hours of packing everything away to ensure a bedbug-free zone, I still didn&#x2019;t feel any better. As I knelt by the black garbage bags, I was hit with a terrible ache in the pit of my stomach&#x2014;that kind of free-floating dread that accompanies heartbreak or death. When I got to my feet, a sharp pain lanced my mind, like a white-hot flash of a migraine, though I had never suffered from one before. As I stumbled to the bathroom, my legs and body just wouldn&#x2019;t react, and I felt as if I were slogging through quicksand. I must be getting the flu, I thought.<br> <br><br> <br>This might not have been the flu, though, the same way there may have been no bedbugs. But there likely was a pathogen of some sort that had invaded my body, a little germ that set everything in motion. Maybe it came from that businessman who had sneezed on me in the subway a few days before, releasing millions of virus particles onto the rest of us in that subway car? Or maybe it was in something I ate or something that slipped inside me through a tiny wound on my skin, maybe through one of those mysterious bug bites?<br> <br>There my mind goes again.<br> <br>The doctors don&#x2019;t actually know how it began for me. What&#x2019;s clear is that if that man had sneezed on you, you&#x2019;d most likely just get a cold. For me, it flipped my universe upside down and very nearly sent me to an asylum for life.</p><h2>The 80/20 Principle: The Secret of Achieving More with Less</h2><p>The 80/20 Principle--that 80 percent of results flow from just 20 percent of our efforts--is one of the great secrets of highly effective people and organizations.<br><br>One of the decade's most original, provocative, and powerful books, <i>The 80/20 Principle</i> shows how you can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by concentrating on the all-important 20 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Astonishingly, although the 80/20 Principle has long influenced today's world, Richard Koch is the first person to show how to use it in a systematic and practical way.<br><br>The pattern of predictable imbalance underlying the 80/20 Principle was first discovered a hundred years ago by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto while studying income and wealth patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pattern of "predictable imbalance," as he termed it, crops up throughout life.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>The 80/20 Principle,</i> Koch opens our eyes to the way the principle works through a wide range of examples in business, commerce, and virtually every aspect of our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, 20 percent of products account for 80 percent of sales and profits; similarly, 20 percent of customers account for 80 percent of revenues.<br><br>By identifying and focusing on the 20 percent of our efforts that result in the huge bulk of our success, we can leverage our efforts to vastly increase our effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;For we discover that little of what we do really counts.&nbsp;&nbsp;By concentrating on those things that do, we can transform our effectiveness in our jobs, our careers, our businesses, and our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;By showing how to unlock the enormous potential of the magic 20 percent, <i>The 80/20 Principle</i> will revolutionize your life.</p><p>In 1897, Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, in his study of the patterns of wealth and income, observed that the distribution of wealth was predictably unbalanced. He first discovered this pattern in 19th-century England and found it to be the same for every country and time period he studied. Over the years, Pareto's observation has become known as the 80/20 principle. <p>Now in 1998, Richard Koch takes a fresh look at the 80/20 principle and finds that the basic imbalance observed by Pareto 100 years ago can be found in almost every aspect of modern life. Whether you're investing in stocks, analyzing company sales, or looking at the performance of a Web site, you'll find that it's usually 20 percent that produces 80 percent of the total result. This means 80 percent of what you do may not count for much. Koch helps you to identify that 20 percent and shows you how you can get more out of your business, and life, for less.</p>From <i>The 80/20 Principle:</i><p>"The 80/20 Principle can and should be used by every intelligent person in their daily life...It can multiply the profitability of corporations and the effectiveness of any organization. It even holds the key to raising the quality and quantity of public services while cutting their cost... The 80/20 Principle asserts that a minority of causes, inputs, or effort usually lead to a majority of the results, outputs, or rewards. Taken literally, for example, 80 percent of what you achieve in your job comes from 20 percent of the time spent. Thus for all practical purposes, four fifths of the effort--a dominant part of it--is largely irrelevant."</p><p>To learn how you can tap the hidden potential of the 80/20 principle in your life, read Richard Koch's exciting new book.</p></p><h2>Health Through God&#39;s Pharmacy: Advice and Experiences With Medicinal Herbs</h2><p>At the time when the majority of mankind has moved away from life's natural ways; when illness caused by a changed attitude to life, threatens; we should&nbsp;turn again to medicinal herbs which God in His Greatness has provided&nbsp;for us since time immemorial. As&nbsp;a renowned European herbalist, said: "There is a plant for every illness!"</p><p></p><h2>A Table in the Presence</h2><p><p>On April 10th, 2003, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, faced with the task of seizing the presidential palace in downtown Baghdad, ran headlong into what Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North called, "the worst day of fighting for U.S. Marines." Hiding in buildings and mosques, wearing civilian clothes, and spread out for over a mile, Saddam Hussein's militants rained down bullets and rocket propelled grenades on the 1st Battalion. But when the smoke of the eight-hour battle cleared, only one Marine had lost his life. Some said the 1st Battalion was incredibly lucky. But in the hearts and minds of the Marines who were there, there was no question. God had brought them miraculously through that battle.</p><p>As the 1st Battalion's chaplain, Lieutenant Carey Cash had the unique privilege of seeing firsthand, from the beginning of the war to the end, how God miraculously delivered, and even transformed, the lives of the men of the 1st Battalion. Their regiment, the most highly decorated regiment in the history of the Marines, was the first ground force to cross the border into Iraq, the first to see one of their own killed in battle, and they were the unit to fight what most believe to have been the decisive battle of the war-April 10th in downtown Baghdad. Through it all, Carey Cash says, the presence of God was undeniable. Cash even had the privilege of baptizing fifty-seven new Christians-Marines and Sailors-during the war in Iraq.</p><p>The men of the 1st Battalion came to discover what King David had discovered long ago--that God's presence could be richly experienced even in the presence of enemies. Here is the amazing story of their experience.</p></p><p>Lt. Carey H. Cash is a battalion chaplain to infantry Marines in the United States Navy. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, his unit was the first ground combat element to cross the border into Iraq. He is a graduate of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and was commissioned as a chaplain in 1999. Cash and his wife, Charity have five children, and live near Norfolk, Virginia.An Unexpected Feast<br><br> &#x201c;Wake up!&#x201d;<br><br> As the lights to our squad tent flickered to life, I struggled to wipe the sand and grit out of my eyes and to sit up in the sleeping bag that for the last six weeks had been home. I only needed to take one look at the face of my executive officer, Major Cal Worth, to realize what was happening. His eyes were like steel; his face, expressionless. My heart raced.<br><br> &#x201c;You have five hours to get your gear packed and yourselves into your vehicles. We&#x2019;re moving north!&#x201d;<br><br> You could have heard a pin drop in the tent. It was an announcement we had been expecting for weeks, yet his words hit us like a train.<br><br> &#x201c;Any questions? No? Good! Then be advised there will be a mandatory staff meeting in thirty minutes. You&#x2019;ll get more info then. Get moving!&#x201d; With that he turned and walked out.<br><br> For the next few moments, no one moved a muscle. We sat on the tops of our sleeping bags in shock, wrestling with the magnitude of what we&#x2019;d just heard. We looked at one another, but no one said a thing. We didn&#x2019;t have to. The words still lingered in the stale air of the tent. Then finally, as if we were responding to a choreographed script, every one of us jumped up and started packing our gear.<br><br> Within minutes, I could tell that the message was permeating the entire camp. Senior Marines were barking out orders. Trucks, tanks, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs or Humvees) were being moved into place. More than one thousand infantrymen, living in a space no bigger than a parking lot, started packing their personal supplies, filling their canteens, double-checking the status of their ammunition, writing last-minute letters, and saying prayers.<br><br> A young officer grabbed my arm. &#x201c;Hey Chaplain, if something should happen to me, will you give this letter to my girl?&#x201d;<br><br> Hey, wait a minute, I thought. That&#x2019;s just for the movies.<br><br> The man who handed me the letter was a decorated combat veteran. He had been among the first to land deep in enemy territory in Afghanistan. He&#x2019;d been through this before, and his face was quite serious. I took the letter.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be okay,&#x201d; I reassured him.<br><br> Was I sure about that? I tucked his letter deep within my pack, quietly hoping that I would never have to pull it out.<br><br> Meanwhile, the frenzy of activity intensified. I could see the camps next to ours springing to life as well. Flashlights from every tent shot beams across the clear desert sky. Engines rumbled to life. The sound of men&#x2019;s voices, some laughing and joking, some urgent and tense, were echoing from camp to camp. This was it! We were all heading out. Would we ever see this place again?<br><br> It was the evening of March 17, 2003. We had already been in the desert for forty days. Tired and restless, we were quite honestly wondering if the war was ever going to get kicked off. Two or three weeks were all that we&#x2019;d expected to wait before the official word came to invade Iraq, yet there we were, approaching a month and a half. By now the days were growing longer, and the sun was getting ever hotter. The hope of a hot shower had all but evaporated, and shaving was merciless. The cold water had dulled the last of our razors, producing a wide variety of facial grimaces each morning as we pulled and tugged on our beards.<br><br> And then there were the sandstorms. Before arriving in Kuwait, we had all been told about the intense desert winds. But there was no way we could ever have anticipated how vio- lent the storms would get. The weather pattern that brought them about was no mystery. When the wind blew in from the north, we enjoyed clear skies. But when the wind shifted directions and started blowing from the south, the sky would turn a deep dark blue, then brown; and then, like a thundering horde rolling indiscriminately over man and beast, the stinging sand would consume us. There was no escaping its relentless barrage. At times it would beat its implacable drum against our tents for hours. Our romantic notions were fading fast as every new sandstorm further eroded the grandeur of &#x201c;going off to war.&#x201d;<br><br> During those forty days, when we weren&#x2019;t rehearsing our attack, we spent much of our time laboring to piece together any fragments of news we could get our hands on. What was happening in the White House? In Baghdad? Had diplomacy run its course? What of the inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction? How were Americans viewing the war? How were they viewing us? How real was the threat of chemical weapons? Would the enemy surrender quickly? Or would he fight to the death?<br><br> We were all asking the same questions. We were all looking for something, anything, to cling to; any precious bit of news that might provide us with some sense of certainty either way. In the end we would have to settle for outdated newspapers and garbled radio transmissions that relayed as much static as commentary. Phone calls were precious but rare; the mail was slow. After forty days in a vast and often unforgiving desert, urgency had faded into monotony.<br><br> Marines and soldiers, however, have solutions for deal- ing with monotony. In fact, every Marine who is qualified enough to rise to the rank of corporal is expected by his command to be able to accurately diagnose the morale of his men and to come up with some clever antidote for the ailment, like a doctor who writes out prescriptions for sick patients. Of course the antidotes are as diverse as the men who think them up&#x2014;a forced march, a grueling run. Or, if the men are lucky and their leader happens to be in particularly amiable spirits, the prescription might be a Humvee pull, a tire-throw, or a tug-of-war match.<br><br> On that particular Tuesday night in mid-March, it was obvious that no half-measures would do. The frustration of waiting had finally worked itself, like a thorn, into the skin of most of us. Faces were growing long. Arguments were becoming a daily ritual. Friendships were strained. Something had to be done, so the decision was unanimous. The antidote to our desert malaise would be a talent show.<br><br> As word leaked out about the night&#x2019;s main event, I could sense growing excitement. At least I know I was looking forward to it. For six weeks, everything had been business: chemical weapons drills, battalion hikes, live-fire ranges, late-night staff meetings, intelligence updates. We knew we were there on a mission, and from day one, we did nothing but prepare ourselves for it. So when the decision was made to host a battalion-wide talent show, it was as if a breath of fresh air blew throughout the entire camp, enlivening even the most dispirited man.<br><br> I had just finished off the last of my broiled chicken and rice and was enjoying the sweet taste of my warm soda when I first began to hear laughter. It wasn&#x2019;t the roaring kind of laughter you might expect to come from the lungs of grown men or warriors. This was more like snickering and giggling, the kind of laughter you&#x2019;d hear behind a child&#x2019;s door at a slumber party. I was amused but also intrigued. The sound of the voices began to lighten my spirit, and like a magnet, it pulled me outside into the cool desert night to investigate. As I walked from tent to tent, I could see groups of Marines and sailors huddled together, feverishly planning out their appearances for the night&#x2019;s coming festivities. They were rehearsing every type of act imaginable: singing, skits, stand-up comedy, classical guitar, and just as I expected, those always-feared, never-avoided impersonations.<br><br> Young infantrymen&#x2014;also known as &#x201c;grunts&#x201d;&#x2014;can&#x2019;t get away with much when it comes to challenging authority; and few ever try. However, impersonations are different. Impersonating a senior-ranking Marine is, to my knowledge, the one and only time a grunt can take a stab at his superiors and still come out alive. It&#x2019;s almost sacrosanct; an understood realm of asylum, of immunity from reprisal. Overhearing some of the skits and impersonations that a few brave men were planning that night, I knew that some of them were sure to get a rise from the crowd that was already beginning to gather around the seven-ton truck that now doubled as our stage.<br><br> By 8:00 p.m., the judges were in place, the performers were ready, and the audience was stirring. Under dim flickering lights, and armed with a substandard sound system, the men of First Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment hosted what must have been the finest talent show the northern Kuwaiti desert had ever witnessed.<br><br> Of course I had seen grown men laugh hysterically before. Having attended a military college where I played varsity football, I&#x2019;d known my own share of rowdy evenings out with the guys. But this was altogether different. More than a good time, this was a release. This was six weeks of pent-up tension and anxiety erupting into the night sky in the form of laughter and cheering. There was no doubt that every person out there needed that night to chase away the stress and frustration of the last six weeks of waiting. We needed it to drive away the feelings of loneliness that grew stronger with every passing night. We needed it to deal with our fear.<br><br> Yet therapeutic as the evening was, I couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling that something was about to happen. There we were in a hostile land, only miles from a border where enemy soldiers patrolled continuously. We all knew that an order might come down at any moment, leading us into mortal combat. Shadowing our exuberance and elation was the very real and imminent prospect of danger and death. One thousand of us were laughing, singing, and cheering; yet we were also poised to enter a different world, where such festivi- ties would be impossible. Was this, quite literally, the last hoorah?<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t share my uneasiness with anyone else, but I am certain others felt the same way. Nevertheless, inebriated by laughter and camaraderie, all one thousand of us went to sleep that night in peace about 11:00 p.m. Three hours later, we learned that our lives were about to change forever.<br> In those silent seconds following Major Worth&#x2019;s middle-of-the-night announcement, my thoughts turned toward my fellow chaplains. The four of us had ministered together for six weeks in the desert. We each represented different Christian faith groups: Chaplain Frank Holley, a Methodist; Chaplain Erik Lee, a Nazarene; Chaplain Mark Tanis, a Lutheran; and I, a Baptist. In the course of those weeks, we had all become close friends, even brothers. We conducted services together, assisted each other in baptisms and counseling, and offered one another a listening ear when we needed to vent. When would I ever see them again?<br><br> My mind snapped to at the sound of a familiar voice.<br><br> &#x201c;Sir, do you need any help loading your supplies?&#x201d;<br><br> It was a voice I recognized well, even in the dark. Second Class Petty Officer Redor Rufo was my personal assistant&#x2014;a religious program specialist (RP), who assists me in the administrative tasks required to conduct ministry. That is not, however, his only job. In war, the RP is a chaplain&#x2019;s bodyguard. Geneva Convention and navy regulations do not permit chaplains to serve as combatants. In fact, a chaplain is the only member of the entire military who is not permitted to brandish a weapon. Chaplains sometimes speculate about what they would do if their men were overrun, if they had the choice to defend themselves with a rifle or pistol. It&#x2019;s a tough call, but I always thought that if the life of a fellow Marine or sailor was at stake, I&#x2019;d use the weapon.<br><br> Nevertheless, I knew Rufo would not hesitate to use his rifle if we ever found ourselves in real danger. He had the heart of a giant and the tenacity of a street fighter. A 5'4" Filipino-American with a stout build and cackling laugh, Redor Rufo had come to the States when he was in high school, following in the footsteps of two older brothers who had joined the navy before him. Always the generous peacemaker, Rufo overwhelmingly won the affection of the senior men in the battalion just two days after he arrived. He managed to do this by cooking up some of his famous panzet and lumpia, and serving them out of our office space.<br><br> Rufo&#x2019;s spirited generosity was no passing fancy. He&#x2019;s the only man I&#x2019;ve ever heard kidding about having his own island one day; he would call his island Rufo Island, and he would be its benevolent dictator. The truth is, although farfetched, anyone who knew Rufo could easily see him doing just that: granting favors, pardons, gifts, and loving every minute of it. Still, kind and peaceable as he was, Rufo knew how to scrap. It didn&#x2019;t take me long to learn that despite his small frame, he could hold his own with anybody.<br><br> The two of us had served together since April 2002, when he joined the battalion. Every day had been an opportunity for us to grow in our mutual trust and respect for one another. Everywhere I went, Rufo was with me. If it meant walking the line together for hours on end, talking to young warriors in fighting holes, he walked beside me. If it meant setting up and taking down for eight worship services in one day, he was there, never flagging in zeal, always an encouragement to the other men in the battalion.<br><br> As the two of us loaded supplies into our Humvee, I sensed a note of pain in his voice. &#x201c;I got to talk to my wife last night, sir. I waited in line for the phone for hours, but I finally got through. I&#x2019;m so glad I did.&#x201d;<br><br> Calling home from Kuwait was definitely a rarity. There was only one phone for more than a thousand men, and more often than not, the phone wasn&#x2019;t working. When the phone actually functioned, you had to be prepared to speak to your loved one through a three-second delay.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello . . . can you hear me?&#x201d;<br><br> Three to four seconds would pass, and then the voice on the other end would inevitably answer, &#x201c;Yes . . . I can hear you . . .&#x201d;<br><br> On and on this would go, until &#x201c;good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br> Calls home had the effect of producing both joy and pain. We were elated anytime we had the opportunity to call our wives or parents. Yet with each phone call came the quiet realization that this call might be the last one before we went into battle. Every word spoken was precious; every moment, dear. As good as it felt to hear your loved one&#x2019;s voice, many of our men said that it caused more pain than anything else. I know it did for me. It reminded me of home. And there were more than a few in our battalion who deliberately chose not to call. I could understand why. It just hurt too much.<br><br> Clearly, Rufo was glad he&#x2019;d been able to talk to his wife. But I could tell there was an ache in his heart. There was one in mine too.<br><br> It had been more than a month since I had spoken to my wife, Charity, and that conversation had lasted only a few minutes. When the phone rang in our Southern California home, it was 4:00 in the morning.<br><br> Charity&#x2019;s voice, suddenly stirred out of sleep, quietly answered, &#x201c;Hello.&#x201d;<br><br> Overjoyed to hear her voice, it was all I could do not to shout to her, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me&#x2014;Carey!&#x201d;<br><br> Immediately, I could tell that she had begun to cry. We both started crying as a flood of emotions swept over us.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know when I&#x2019;ll be able to talk to you again, but just know that I am doing well. God is taking care of me.&#x201d;<br><br> For security purposes, I was not able to tell her exactly where I was, when we thought we might be moving north, or how long our stay might be. But that didn&#x2019;t matter. More than anything else, I wanted her to know that I was okay, that the men were doing well, that we were relying on the Lord, that her prayers for us were being answered daily in our lives, and, most of all, that I loved her and the children.

While we tend to think of America's ties with China as starting in 1972 with the visit of President Richard Nixon to China, the patterns<b>&#x2015;</b>rapturous enchantment followed by angry disillusionment<b>&#x2015;</b>were set in motion hundreds of years earlier. </p><p>Drawing on personal letters, diaries, memoirs, government documents, and contemporary news reports, John Pomfret reconstructs the surprising, tragic, and marvelous ways Americans and Chinese have engaged with one another through the centuries. A fascinating and thrilling account, <i>The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom</i> is also an indispensable book for understanding the most important<b>&#x2015;</b>and often the most perplexing<b>&#x2015;</b>relationship between any two countries in the world.</p></p><p><b>John Pomfret</b> served as a correspondent for the <i>Washington Post</i> for two decades, covering wars, revolutions, and China. He is the author of the acclaimed book <i>Chinese Lessons, </i>and has won awards for his reporting on Asia, including the Osborne Elliot Prize. He holds a BA and MA from Stanford University and was one of the first American students to go to China after relations were normalized. Pomfret was expelled from China after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Most recently, he was a Fulbright senior scholar in Beijing.<p><b>WINNER OF THE 2017 ARTHUR ROSS BOOK AWARD FROM THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS</b> </p><p>"Donald Trump (or his next secretary of state) would be well advised to read this timely and comprehensively informative book...very good and important." <b>&#x2015;Simon Winchester for <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"...exhaustively researched and vigorously told...If the new administration in Washington wishes to get a sense of the broad sweep of American history with China, I can think of few better places to start than this book." <b><i>&#x2015;</i>Howard W.

Pomfret, a veteran journalist and author of the well-received <i>Chinese Lessons: Five Classmates and the Story of the New China</i> (2006), reminds us that we are dealing with a love-hate relationship that dates back to the years following the American Revolution<i>... The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom</i>, though containing clear arguments, including the idea that there is a related love-hate dynamic in American views of China, is ultimately a biographically driven work.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;Financial Times</i></b></p><p>"Trump must learn more about the history of U.S.-China relations ...

I like being part of a family that&#x2019;s happy! I know that not everyone has a happy family, but we can still choose to live a happy life, because happiness starts with what&#x2019;s inside of us, not with what we have or do not have. If we can think happy, we can be happy.<br> <br>When I was in junior high school, I learned a song called &#x201c;Garbage in, Garbage Out.&#x201d; I liked it because of the words, and so I played the song for my eighth-grade Bible class and gave a speech about it.<br> <br>I learned an important lesson from that song: what you think about will come out in your life. If you put garbage into your mind, garbage will come out. It&#x2019;s just like what happens if you put junk food into your body. If you eat nothing but chips and desserts, you will not end up being lean and fit and strong. To put it politely, you&#x2019;ll be the opposite. In the same way, if you fill your mind with negative thoughts, bad words, or ideas that are not nice or respectful toward others, you will eventually think bad thoughts, use bad language, and act on bad ideas. The good thing about the &#x201c;garbage in, garbage out&#x201d; principle is that it also means that if you fill your mind with positive thoughts, encouraging words, and ideas about how to be kind or how to be a good friend, then all those things will show up in the way you act and eventually become the way you live.<br> HAPPY TODAY, HAPPY TOMORROW<p></p> <br>There&#x2019;s a connection between the way you think and the way you are. Not only that, there&#x2019;s also a direct link between the way you think today and the person you will become tomorrow. Your thoughts, words, and actions will determine your life more than anything else&#x2014;more than where you go to college, more than what you major in, and more than the first job you get.<br> <br>Years ago, someone came up with a great quotation that makes this point really well. I say &#x201c;years ago&#x201d; because a version of this saying goes back at least to 1910, and I say &#x201c;someone&#x201d; because it has been credited to all kinds of people, from Mahatma Gandhi to Margaret Thatcher&#x2019;s father to the founder of a supermarket chain in Texas.1 I&#x2019;m not sure anyone knows who should really get the credit for it, but I like the words, and I know they are true:<br> <br>Watch your thoughts, for they become words.<br> <br>Watch your words, for they become actions.<br> <br>Watch your actions, for they become habits.<br> <br>Watch your habits, for they become your character.<br> <br>Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.2<br> <br>The short &#x201c;Sadie version&#x201d; of this quotation is: your thoughts determine your destiny. If you want to get a glimpse of where you are headed in the future, start by looking at what you&#x2019;re thinking about today.<br> <br>Before you go any farther in this book, I want to encourage you to make up your mind to be happy, because your mind is where happiness begins. Thinking happy will not mess up your schedule, and it will not cost any money, but it will be the best investment you can make. It won&#x2019;t even make you tired; in fact, it will probably give you more energy than ever, because happiness just has that effect on people. If you are down or discouraged, decide today to shake that off and become a happier person by thinking happier thoughts. You can make your life and your future better just by thinking happier thoughts.<br> HAPPINESS STARTS WITH YOU<p></p> <br>Too many people believe that other people will make them happy. This is especially true for teenagers. So many of us think we will be happy if we can just hang out with the &#x201c;right&#x201d; group of people or if we can get the boyfriend or girlfriend we want. We also tend to think things will make us happy. We say we will be happy if we can get a certain outfit, pair of boots, new type of phone, or kind of car. We sometimes think we&#x2019;ll be happy if we make the best grades in the class, have the lead in a play, or are starters or high scorers on a sports team.<br> <br>I have to say to my fellow teenagers: this kind of thinking is just not right. True happiness doesn&#x2019;t depend on a certain group of friends, a boyfriend or girlfriend, a new phone, an outfit, or a car. These things might make us excited for a little while, but they cannot make us truly happy for a long while.<br> <br>Ultimately, happiness can only come from inside you. If you allow any of these other things to determine your happiness, you will always be let down. The world is not perfect: people disappoint us, friends change or move, parents lose jobs, and bad things happen. Paul said in Philippians 4:12&#x2013;13:<br> <br>I know what it is to be in need,<br> <br>and I know what it is to have plenty.<br> <br>I have learned the secret of being content<br> <br>in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry,<br> <br>whether living in plenty or in want.<br> <br>I can do everything through him who gives me strength.3<br> <br>For several years, my family and I have traveled to the Dominican Republic on mission trips. I&#x2019;ll write more about that later, but for now I just want to say that when we go, we meet people who have nothing the world says is important, yet they are happy.<br> <br>Then I think about the TV show where a couple who won millions of dollars in a lottery was interviewed. This couple said it was the worst thing that had ever happened to them&#x2014;the money just created a lot of stress. They said their whole family ended up fighting over the money and then lost it because they did not know how to manage it. I&#x2019;m guessing that these people were not happy with what they had before they won the lottery, so it&#x2019;s not surprising that they weren&#x2019;t happy with more. Happiness is a choice&#x2014;a choice to be joyful, no matter what the circumstance. This is something adults try to tell us, and I&#x2019;ll admit it: they&#x2019;re right.<br> <br>The only thing that can really make us happy is a relationship with God. If we know Him and do our best to do what His Word tells us to do, we will enjoy lifelong happiness. He knows exactly what we need in order to be truly happy, and He will lead us to those experiences if we seek Him, trust Him, and obey Him. We have to make a choice to have a relationship with Him. That&#x2019;s the best and most important choice we will ever make. It will not guarantee that we won&#x2019;t have hard times, but it will take us a long way toward a happy life.<br> <br>As teenagers, there are a lot of things you and I do not have control over. But we are 100 percent in control of the way we think, the way we feel, and the choices we make. We have the power to choose what we think, and what we think will determine the way we feel.<br> <br>Bible teacher Joyce Meyer says: &#x201c;Positive thinking doesn&#x2019;t just happen. It&#x2019;s something you have to do on purpose.&#x201d;4 I always try to put positive things into my mind so that positive things will come out in my words and actions. Like other people, I do not always feel like being positive or happy. Sometimes it would be a lot easier to complain, but what good would that do me? Sure, sometimes it takes more effort to be happy than to be sad, but the result is worth the effort.<br> <br>We are naturally drawn to people who are positive and happy. When I see a positive person, I think they have their life figured out. They seem to have everything going on. I want to get to know those people because they have something I think is valuable: confidence and a happy, positive attitude. Negative people are no fun to be around and they certainly don&#x2019;t seem confident or together. If we hang out with positive people, their good attitudes will influence us, and we will become upbeat and happy too.<br> <br>But like Joyce Meyer says, it will not just happen. We have to work on it every day. We have to choose to be positive, even when circumstances are negative. We have to choose to be happy, even when discouraging things come our way. If you are not in the habit of choosing to be happy, it may take some practice. But just keep working on it. You&#x2019;ll get there&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll be glad you did.<br> THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I KNOW<p></p> <br>When I think about people who are truly happy, I have to mention my two sisters. At the time I&#x2019;m writing this book, my little sister, Bella, is eleven years old. My older sister, Rebecca, is twenty-five. She came to live with our family in 2005 as an exchange student from Taiwan, and now she is just as much a part of our family as the rest of us.<br> <br>Bella is only in fifth grade, but I know a lot of fifth graders who already take life very seriously. Bella does not! She loves to laugh and play, and if she is involved in something, she is determined to make it a fun, happy experience for herself and for everyone else. She has a great sense of humor, which I think is very mature for her age. Unlike a lot of kids her age, she does not laugh at bathroom jokes or sarcastic comments about other people. She knows what is genuinely funny in a clean, wholesome way, and she can dish out that kind of humor like no eleven-year-old I have ever met.<br> <br>I think Bella&#x2019;s main goal in life right now is to put smiles on other people&#x2019;s faces. She just loves to make others happy; that&#x2019;s what she thinks about, so that&#x2019;s how she lives. And if a person&#x2019;s goal is to make others happy, then that person will definitely be happy too.<br> <br>Another thing Bella does is refuse to get upset over little things. Not long ago, one of her friends was mean to her and blocked her on Instagram. Instead of coming home from school that day pouting about the situation or being dramatic and feeling that no one liked her anymore, Bella simply said, &#x201c;That was ridiculous. I mean, that was ree-diculous!&#x201d; She could have easily been hurt or angry, but she was not. In fact, the whole incident really did not faze her. She is not the kind of person who lets other people&#x2019;s actions upset her, and that&#x2019;s a big reason she is so happy.<br> <br>Rebecca is one of those people who is cute and happy and bubbly almost all the time. She loves to laugh and to make others laugh, and she really enjoys telling jokes. The problem with her jokes is that they may be funny in her native language or in the country where she was raised, but they are not funny at all in English or in Louisiana!<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s one of her jokes: &#x201c;One time a banana got hot and took off his coat and slipped.&#x201d; (Yep, that was the joke.) Here&#x2019;s another one: &#x201c;Once there was a match that had an itchy head; he scratched it and caught himself on fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ha! See what I mean? The fact that the jokes are not funny ends up making Rebecca&#x2019;s attempts at humor kind of funny in their own way. We all laugh at her jokes just because she tries so hard to spread laughter around our family. Rebecca is strong and positive, and other people cannot help but be happy around her. I am so glad she joined our family because just her presence makes me happy.<br> <br>While I&#x2019;m thinking about happy people, I can&#x2019;t overlook my great-uncle Si. Seriously, he is the happiest, funniest, most positive person I know. I&#x2019;m sure a lot of people my age cannot say they have a strong relationship with their great-uncle, but Uncle Si and I are very close. I like being around him as much as possible, because any time he is involved in anything, it&#x2019;s a guaranteed laugh. He has the ability to make anything fun and to see the humor in things that might be frustrating to other people.<br> <br>Recently, Uncle Si was duck hunting in very cold weather with Papaw Phil and my uncles. Suddenly, their boat began to sink. I was not there, but I heard the sinking boat brought out everyone&#x2019;s true personality. Papaw Phil took it like a man; he just stood there and watched while the boat sank and then walked very calmly through the water to the duck blind, even though he was about to freeze. My uncles were jumping around screaming, all shouting out different ways to fix the boat. And Uncle Si just laughed and told jokes while he watched the boat go down.<br> <br>One time something really sad happened to Uncle Si; his house was infested with termites. He and his wife, Christine, had lived in that house for a long time. It was home to them and they really loved it. The termites did a lot of damage to the house before Uncle Si realized it, so he and Christine had no choice but to move out before it fell down.<br> <br>Uncle Si&#x2019;s response to the situation was not, &#x201c;Oh, poor me. I&#x2019;m losing the house I&#x2019;ve loved and lived in all these years.&#x201d;<br> <br>His response was, &#x201c;Okay. We&#x2019;ve got termites. We need to get a new house.&#x201d;<br> <br>So they moved into a new home, and they are very happy there. I know the reason Uncle Si handled this situation so well is that he does not let his circumstances determine his happiness. He is a happy person, no matter where he lives. He was happy in his old house, and all he had to do when he moved to the new house was take his happiness with him. And for Uncle Si, that was no problem at all!<br> WE WERE HAPPY BEFORE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<p></p> <br>Lots of little girls like the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I was one of them. One of the songs in the movie is &#x201c;Whistle While You Work.&#x201d; The lesson of the song is that work&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s homework or cleaning your room or a job in some kind of business&#x2014;does not have to be boring or hard. It can be fun if you think of ways to make it fun. I have never been good at whistling, but I love to sing while I work. In fact, I have always turned my study guides into songs or raps to help me remember things.<br> <br>A lot of people think the job I have now&#x2014;on Duck Dynasty&#x2014;is really fun. They say they would do anything if they could be a television star. Being on TV is fun at times, but at other times it&#x2019;s hard work&#x2014;just like anybody else&#x2019;s job. I can choose to be happy about it or to complain about it because I have to film instead of going out with my friends. I almost always decide to be cheerful about it, because that just makes life a whole lot easier than being angry or disappointed.<br> <br>I guess I learned to be happy when I was very young and worked in my family&#x2019;s duck-call business. This was way before most people ever heard of Duck Commander. Serious hunters knew about my papaw Phil&#x2019;s company, but not many other people did. Even though the company was not the big business it is now, it took all of us in the family to make it successful&#x2014;even me, when I was six or seven years old.<br> <br>When I was that age, my older brother, John Luke, and I worked for Duck Commander during the summers and at other times when we were not in school. Our cousins Reed and Cole (Jase and Missy&#x2019;s sons) worked with us. The four of us are very close in age. John Luke and Reed were born during the same year. About two years later, Cole and I were born within several months of each other. So all of us have grown up together, and now our two families live right across the street from each other.<br> <br>When all of us were young, we&#x2019;d pile into someone&#x2019;s car and make the trip to Mamaw Kay (most people call her &#x201c;Miss Kay&#x201d;) and Papaw Phil&#x2019;s house, which is about forty-five minutes from our house. In those days, my grandparents ran the Duck Commander business from their home. They had enough land to build a warehouse on their property, so that&#x2019;s where the boys and I went when we &#x201c;went to work.&#x201d; We packed boxes, answered phones, and did everything else we could to fill orders for duck calls. The song &#x201c;Hollaback Girl&#x201d; was popular at that time, and we sang it often, calling it our &#x201c;warehouse song.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the end of each day, Mamaw Kay gave us each five dollars. But those payments were not our greatest rewards. Our greatest rewards were all the good times we...</p><h2>Guardians of the Galaxy 1: The Complete Collection</h2><p>With the fabric of the universe torn, all that stands between us and invading horrors is a team of cosmic misfits.

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit&#x2019;s fortunes:<br><br>Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon. <br><br>Author Laura Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>He didn't <i>look</i> like much. With his smallish stature, knobby knees, and slightly crooked forelegs, he looked more like a cow pony than a thoroughbred. But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote, "was mostly in his heart." Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who became a cultural icon in <i>Seabiscuit: An American Legend</i>.<p> Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that "the day of the horse is past"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who "had cultivated an almost mystical communication with horses"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube. Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of "team Seabiscuit," from early training sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to "Horse of the Year"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.</p><p> Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering "Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em, you old devil!"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and taunted them with his blistering speed.</p><p> Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue ("His history had the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow"; "The California sunlight had the pewter cast of a declining season"), Hillenbrand has crafted a delightful book. Wire to wire, <i>Seabiscuit</i> is a winner. Highly recommended. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>&#x201c;Fascinating . . . Vivid . . .

It was night. No one saw, and the boy&#x2019;s screams were drowned out by the Fifth Avenue buses, the El thundering up Sixth, and trolley bells clanging on Madison.</p><p>The bootlegger shouted down at him, &#x201c;Every bellhop in the hotel sells my booze! Whatsamatter with you?&#x201d;</p><p>Church spires and mansion turrets reached for him like teeth. &#x201c;Last chance, sonny.&#x201d;</p><p>A tall man in a summer suit glided silently across the roof. He drew a Browning automatic from his coat and a throwing knife from his boot. He mounted the parapet and pressed the pistol to the body- guard&#x2019;s temple.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold tight.&#x201d;</p><p>The bodyguard froze. The bootlegger shrank from the blade pricking his throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Who the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Isaac Bell. Van Dorn Agency. Sling him in on the count of two.&#x201d; &#x201c;If you shoot, we drop him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have holes in your heads before he passes the eighteenth floor . . . On my count: One! Pull him up. Two! Swing him over the edge . . . Lay him on the roof&#x2014; Are you O.K., son?&#x201d;</p><p>The bellboy had tears in his eyes. He nodded, head bobbing like a puppet.</p><p>&#x201c;Go downstairs,&#x201d; Isaac Bell told him, sliding his knife back in his boot and shifting the automatic to his left hand. &#x201c;Tell your boss Chief Investigator Bell said to give you the week off and a fifty-dollar bonus for standing up to bootleggers.&#x201d;</p><p>The bodyguard chose his moment well. When the tall detective reached down to help the boy stand, he swung a heavy, ring-studded fist. Skillfully thrown with the full power of a big man&#x2019;s muscle behind it, it was blocked before it traveled four inches.</p><p>A bone-cracking counterpunch staggered him. His knees buckled and he collapsed on the tar. The bootlegger shot empty hands into the sky. &#x201c;O.K., O.K.&#x201d;</p><p>The van Dorn detective agency&#x2014;an operation with field offices in every city in the country and many abroad&#x2014;maintained warm relations with the police. But Isaac Bell spotted trouble when he walked into the 54th Street precinct house.</p><p>The desk sergeant couldn&#x2019;t meet his eye.</p><p>Bell reached across the high desk to shake his hand anyway. This particular sergeant&#x2019;s father, retired roundsman Paddy O&#x2019;Riordan, augmented his pension as a part-time night watchman for Van Dorn Protective Services.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your dad?&#x201d; Paddy was doing fine.</p><p>&#x201c;Any chance of interviewing the bootlegger we caught at the</p><p>Gotham?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The big guy&#x2019;s at the hospital getting his jaw wired.&#x201d; &#x201c;I want the little one, the boss.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Surety company paid his bond.&#x201d;</p><p>Bell was incensed. &#x201c;<i>Bail? </i>For attempted murder?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They expect the protection they pay for,&#x201d; said Sergeant O&#x2019;Riordan, poker-faced. &#x201c;What I would do next time, Mr. Bell, instead of calling us, throw them in the river.&#x201d;</p><p>Bell watched for the cop&#x2019;s reaction when he replied, &#x201c;I reckoned</p><p>Coasties would fish them out.&#x201d;</p><p>O&#x2019;Riordan agreed with a world-weary &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; confirming the rumors that even some officers of the United States Coast Guard&#x2014;the arm of the Treasury Department charged with enforcing Prohibition at sea&#x2014;were in the bootleggers&#x2019; pockets.</p><p>Starting this afternoon, thought Bell, the Van Dorns would put a stop to that.</p><p>One big hand firm on the throttle of his S-1 Flying Yacht, the other on the wheel, Isaac Bell began racing down the East River for take-off speed. He dodged a railcar float and steered into a rapidly narrowing slot between a tugboat pushing a fleet of coal barges and another towing a bright red barge of dynamite. Joseph Van Dorn, the burly, scarlet- whiskered founder of the detective agency, sat beside him in the open cockpit, lost in thought.</p><p>The Greenpoint ferry surged out of the 23rd Street Terminal straight in their path. The sight of the slab-sided vessel, suddenly enormous in their windshield, made Joseph Van Dorn sit up straight. A brave and cool-headed man, he asked, &#x201c;Do we have time to stop?&#x201d;</p><p>Bell shoved his throttle wide open.</p><p>The Liberty engine mounted behind them on the wing thundered. He hauled hard on the wheel.</p><p>The Loening S-1 held speed and altitude records but was notoriously slow to respond to the controls. Bell had replaced its stick and pedals with a combined steering and elevating Bl�riot wheel, in hopes of making it nimbler.</p><p>Passengers on the Greenpoint ferry backed from the rail. Bell gave the wheel one last firm tug.</p><p>The Flying Yacht lunged off the water and cleared the ferry with a foot to spare.</p><p>&#x201c;There ought to be a law against f lying like you,&#x201d; said Van Dorn. Bell flew under the Williamsburg Bridge and between the spotting masts of a battleship docked at the Navy Yard. &#x201c;Sorry to distract you from your dire thoughts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll distract us both to kingdom come.&#x201d;</p><p>Bell headed across leaf-green Brooklyn at one hundred t miles an hour.</p><p>Van Dorn resumed pondering how to deal with misfortune.</p><p>The World War had upended his agency. Some of his best detectives had been killed fighting in the trenches. Others died shockingly young in the influenza epidemic. A post- war recession in the business world was bankrupting clients. And only yesterday, Isaac Bell had discovered that bootleggers, who were getting rich quick off Prohibition by bribing cops and politicians, had corrupted two of his best house detectives at the Hotel Gotham.</p><br><p>Bell climbed to three thousand feet before they reached the Rock- aways. Where the white sand beach slid into the ocean like a f laying knife, he turned and headed east above the string of barrier islands that sheltered Long Island from the raw fury of the Atlantic. A booze smugglers&#x2019; paradise of hidden bays and marshes, inlets, creeks and canals stretched in the lee of those islands as far as he could see.</p><p>Thirty miles from New York, he banked the plane out over the steel-blue ocean and began to descend.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I come in the launch, Chief ?&#x201d;</p><p>Seaman Third Class Asa Somers, the youngest sailor on the Coast Guard cutter CG-9, was beside himself. He had finally made it to sea, patrolling the Fire Island coast for rumrunners on a ship with a cannon and machine guns. Now the fastest f lying boat in the world&#x2014;a high-wing pusher monoplane&#x2014;was looping down from the sky. And if the roar of its four-hundred-horsepower Liberty motor wasn&#x2019;t thrilling enough, it was bringing a famous crime fighter he&#x2019;d read about in <i>Boys&#x2019; Life </i>and the <i>Police Gazette</i>&#x2014;Mr. Joseph Van Dorn, whose army of private detectives vowed: &#x201c;We never give up! Never!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s got you all stirred up?&#x201d; growled the white-haired chief petty officer.</p><p>&#x201c;I want to meet Mr. Van Dorn when he lands.&#x201d; &#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t gonna land.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Open your eyes, boy. See that swell? Four-foot seas&#x2019;ll kick that f lying-boat ass over teakettle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;ll give it a whirl,&#x201d; Somers said, with little hope. <i>Flight</i></p><p><i>Magazine </i>praised the S-1&#x2019;s speed at lot more than its handling.</p><br><p>&#x201c;If he does,&#x201d; said the chief, &#x201c;you can come in the launch to pick up the bodies.&#x201d;</p><p>Up on the f lying bridge, CG-9&#x2019;s skipper expressed the same opinion.</p><p>&#x201c;Stand by with grappling hooks.&#x201d;</p><p>The f lying boat circled lower. When it whipped past, skimming wave tops, Somers recognized Van Dorn, who was seated beside the pilot in the glass-surrounded, open-roofed cockpit, by his red whiskers bristling in the slipstream.</p><p>The roar of the big twelve-cylinder engine faded to a whisper. &#x201c;Lunatic,&#x201d; growled the chief.</p><p>But young Somers watched the Air Yacht&#x2019;s ailerons. The wing f laps fluttered up and down almost faster than the eye could see as the pilot fought to keep her on an even keel. Back in her tail unit, the horizontal stabilizer bit the air, and down she came, steady as a loco- motive on rails. Her long V-shaped hull touched the water, flaring a vapor-thin wake. Her wing floats skimmed the swell, and she settled lightly.</p><p>&#x201c;Somers! Man the bow line.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy leaped into the launch and they motored across the hundred yards that separated the cutter and the flying boat. The huge four-bladed propeller behind the wing stopped spinning, and the pilot, who had made an almost impossible landing look easy, climbed down from the cockpit onto the running board that extended around the front of the rocking hull. He was a tall, lean, fair-haired man with a no-nonsense expression on his handsome face. His golden hair and thick mustache were impeccably groomed. His tailored suit and the broad-brimmed hat pulled tight on his head were both white.</p><p>Somers dropped the bow line.</p><p>&#x201c;What in blazes are you doing?&#x201d; bellowed the chief. &#x201c;I bet that&#x2019;s Isaac Bell!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if it&#x2019;s Mary Pickford! Don&#x2019;t foul that line!&#x201d;</p><p>The boy re-coiled the line, his gaze locked on the pilot. It had to be him. Bell&#x2019;s picture was never in a magazine. But reports on Van Dorn always mentioned his chief investigator&#x2019;s white suit and it suddenly struck Somers that the camera-shy detective could go incognito in a f lash simply by changing his clothes.</p><p>&#x201c;Heave a line, son!&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Come on, you can do it&#x2014;on the jump!&#x201d;</p><p>Somers remembered to let the coil reel out of his palm as the chief had taught him. To his eternal gratitude the rope fell into Bell&#x2019;s big hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Good shot.&#x201d; He pulled the plane and the boat together. Somers asked, &#x201c;Are you Isaac Bell, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m his butler. Mum&#x2019;s the word&#x2014;Bell is still passed out in a speakeasy. Now, let&#x2019;s get Mr. Van Dorn into your boat without drop- ping him in the drink. Ready?&#x201d;</p><p>Bell reached to help Van Dorn, a heavily built man in his fifties with a prominent roman nose and hooded eyes. Van Dorn ignored Bell&#x2019;s hand. Bell seized his elbow and guided him toward Somers with a conspiratorial grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on tight, son, he&#x2019;s not as spry as he looks.&#x201d;</p><p>Behind his grin, Bell&#x2019;s blue eyes were cool and alert. He watched carefully as the older man stepped between the bouncing craft, and he relaxed only after Somers had him safely aboard.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, sailor?&#x201d; asked Van Dorn in a voice that had the faintest lilt of an Irish accent.</p><p>&#x201c;Seaman Third Class Asa Somers, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lied about your age?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d; Somers whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;I worked that dodge to join the Marines.&#x201d; He shot a thumbs-up toward the stern. &#x201c;All aboard, Chief. Back to the ship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>The boat wheeled away from the seaplane.</p><p>Van Dorn called to Bell, &#x201c;Watch yourself at the Gotham. Don&#x2019;t forget, those shameless SOBs have fifty pounds on you.&#x201d;</p><p>If a mountain lion could smile, thought Asa Somers, it would smile like Isaac Bell when he answered, &#x201c;Forget? Never.&#x201d;</p><p>Joseph van Dorn cast a skeptical eye on CG-9, a surplus submarine chaser the U.S. Navy had palmed off on the Coast Guard for Prohibition patrol. With a crow&#x2019;s nest above a f lying bridge, six- cylinder gasoline engines driving triple screws, and a three-inch Poole gun mounted on the foredeck, she had been built to spot, chase, and sink slow-moving German U-boats&#x2014;not fast rumrunners.</p><p>She&#x2019;d been worked hard in the war and scantly maintained since. The drone of pumps told him that her wooden hull had worked open many a leak. Her motor valves were chattering, even at half speed. She would still pack a punch with the Poole gun and a brace of .30.06 Lewis machine guns on the bridge wings. But even if she somehow managed to get in range of a rumrunner, who was trained to fire them?</p><p>Her middle-aged skipper was pouch-eyed and red-nosed. Her aged chief petty officer looked like a Spanish-American War vet. And the crew&#x2014;with the exception of young Somers, who had scrambled eagerly up the mast to the lookout perch in the crow&#x2019;s nest as soon as they shipped the launch&#x2014;were pretty much the quality Van Dorn expected of recruits paid twenty-one dollars a month.</p><p>The skipper greeted him warily.</p><p>Van Dorn disarmed him with the amiable smile that had sent many a criminal to the penitentiary wondering why he had allowed this jovial gent close enough to clamp a steely hand on the scruff of his neck. A twinkle in the eye and a warm chortle in the voice fostered the notion of an easygoing fellow.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose your commandant told you the Treasury Department hired my detective agency to recommend how better to combat the illegal liquor traffic. But I bet scuttlebutt says we&#x2019;re investigating who&#x2019;s in cahoots with the bootleggers&#x2014;pocketing bribes to look the other way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t have to bribe us. They outrun us, and they outnumber us. Or someone&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not saying who &#x2019;cause I don&#x2019;t know who&#x2014;tips them where we&#x2019;re patrolling. Or they radio false distress calls; we&#x2019;re supposed to save lives, so we steam to the rescue, leaving our station wide open. If we happen to catch &#x2019;em, the courts turn &#x2019;em loose and they buy their speedboats back at government auction.&#x201d;</p><p>Van Dorn took a fresh look at the skipper. Maybe his nose was red from a head cold. Drinking man or not, he sounded genuinely indignant and fed up. Who could blame him?</p><p>In the year since Prohibition&#x2014;the banning of the sale of alcohol by the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Volstead Act&#x2014;it seemed half the country had agreed to break the law. Millions of people would pay handsomely for a drink. Short of striking oil or gold in your backyard, there was no way to get richer quicker than to sell hooch. All you needed was a boat you could run a few miles offshore to a rum fleet of foreign- registered freighters and schooners anchored beyond the law in international waters. The newspapers had made a hero of Bill McCoy, captain of a schooner registered in the British Bahama Islands. He had come up with the scheme for circumventing the law, which made enforcing Prohibition a mug&#x2019;s game.</p><p>&#x201c;Like the song says&#x201d;&#x2014;Van Dorn recited a lyric from Irving Berlin&#x2019;s latest hit&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x2018;You cannot make your shimmy shake on tea.&#x2019; How fast are the taxis?&#x201d;</p><p>While fisherman and yacht owners sailed out to the rum fleet to buy a few bottles, big business was conducted by &#x201c;taxis&#x201d; or &#x201c;contact boats&#x201d;&#x2014;high-powered, shallow-draft vessels in which professional rumrunners smuggled hundreds of cases ashore to bootleggers who paid top dollar.</p><p>&#x201c;They build &#x2019;em faster every day.&#x201d;</p><p>Van Dorn shook his head, feigning dismay. Isaac Bell had already convinced him to recommend f lying-boat patrols, though God knows who would pay for them. Congress banned booze but failed to cough up money for enforcement.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Taxi!&#x201d;</i></p><p>All eyes shot to the crow&#x2019;s nest.</p><p>Joseph van Dorn whipped a pair of binoculars from his voluminous overcoat and focused in the direction Asa Somers was pointing his telescope. Low in the water and painted as gray as the sea and the sky, the rum boat was barely visible at a thousand yards.</p><p>&#x201c;Full speed!&#x201d; ordered the skipper, and bounded up the ladder to</p><br><p>the f lying bridge atop the wheelhouse. Van Dorn climbed heavily after him.</p><p>The engines ground harder. Valves stormed louder. The subchaser dug her stern in and boiled a white wake. &#x201c;Fifteen knots,&#x201d; said the skipper.</p><p>Subchasers had been built to do eighteen, but the oily blue smoke spewing from her exhaust ports told Van Dorn her worn engines were pushing their lim...</p></p><h2>The Chili Queen: A Novel</h2><p><p>Life may have been hard on Addie French, but when she meets friendless Emma Roby on a train, all her protective instincts emerge. Emma's brother is seeing her off to Nalgitas to marry a man she has never met. And Emma seems like a lost soul to Addie-someone who needs Addie's savvy and wary eye. It isn't often that Addie is drawn to anyone as a friend, but Emma seems different somehow. When Emma's prospective fails to show up at the train depot, Addie breaks all her principles to shelter the girl at her brothel, The Chili Queen. But once Emma enters Addie's life, the secrets that unfold and schemes that are hatched cause both women to question everything they thought they knew. With Sandra Dallas's trademark humor, charm, and pathos, <i>The Chili Queen</i> will satisfy anyone who has ever longed for happiness.</p><p><i>The Chili Queen </i>is the winner of the 2003 Spur Award for Best Western Novel.</p></p><p><p>Award-winning author <b>Sandra Dallas</b> was dubbed "a quintessential American voice" by Jane Smiley, in <i>Vogue Magazine</i>. She is the author of <i>The Bride's House</i>,<i> Whiter Than Snow</i>, <i>Prayers for Sale</i> and <i>Tallgrass</i>, among others.

For 25 years, Dallas worked as a reporter covering the Rocky Mountain region for <i>Business Week</i>, and started writing fiction in 1990. She lives with her husband in Denver, Colorado.</p><i>THE CHILI QUEEN (Chapter One)</i><p><i>As the train pulled into the shabby station at</i> Palestine, Kansas, the pinch-faced farmers and their wives in their rusty black-wool best lined up along the tracks like the teeth of a rake. In the Kansas heat, three boys slumped on an empty baggage cart in the shade of the depot, too listless even to tie a tin can to a cat's tail. A bitch in heat wouldn't draw a yellow dog under that sun, Addie French thought, as she shaded her eyes from the hurtful glare of the prairie, which was bleached the dirty white of worn underwear. She put a handkerchief to her nose, as if to block out the stench of sweat and barnyard and old pancakes that clung to the farmers' clothes. Although she had spent well over half her thirty-six years off the land, Addie never forgot the sour smells of the farm. She wiped her damp face and neck with a soiled handkerchief, leaving behind streaks of dirt on her wet skin.</p><p>The trip to Kansas City had been even more successful than she had hoped, financially, at any rate, and she was going home to New Mexico with enough money to buy a new cookstove and add a front porch to The Chili Queen. The gentleman friend she met there every August on his annual business trip to the city had shown her an especially good time, bought her two dresses, and paid generously for her companionship. In fact, he had been so attentive that Addie wondered if he might suggest a permanent relationship. Perhaps his wife had died at last and he was ready to propose a formal arrangement--not that she was interested, of course; still, it would do a girl good to be asked. As the week came to a close, however, he told Addie that he was moving to Montana with his wife, and he was sorry, but he wouldn't be seeing her again. He begged Addie to stay two more days; he was as hot as a billy goat in a pepper patch. As she remembered their last night, tears formed in Addie's eyes, and she swatted at them with the handkerchief. She sniffed, feeling sorry for herself that such a nice arrangement had come to an end. Feeling sorry for herself was one of the things Addie did best. She'd miss him and the yearly vacations, although she wouldn't miss Kansas. Oh my, she hated Kansas, Addie thought, catching the stink of her hot, damp body. New Mexico was hard on her hair and skin, but she'd take New Mexico's dryness over Kansas's humidity any day. She was glad to be going home.</p><p>Perhaps she should have telegraphed Welcome, telling her she'd been detained. Welcome, Addie snorted, what kind of name was that, even for a black woman? For all Addie knew, Welcome had run off with the china while she was gone--not that the china was worth anything. No sense to buy good china when the whores were likely to throw it at the customers, or each other. Addie valued Welcome more than the dishes. None of the other domestics she hired stayed for more than a few days, but Welcome had been there for four weeks, and rascally and outspoken as she was, she liked the job and planned to stay, or that was what she'd told Addie, at any rate. The first time she met her, Addie had had a feeling about Welcome, and for no reason she could put her finger on, she trusted her--trusted her enough to leave her in charge of The Chili Queen while Addie was away. She could have closed down the hookhouse, but she was afraid she'd come back and find the girls gone. So she hadn't had any choice but to trust Welcome.</p><p>The woman had shown up one morning asking for work, speaking in that funny way she had; Addie thought it was a mixture of slavery talk and high-class language Welcome had picked up somewhere. Addie was desperate for hired help. Plenty of whores came through looking for work, although not when she needed them, it seemed. But not many women looked for jobs backstairs in a parlor house, cooking and washing for as lazy and ungrateful a group of human beings as ever lived. Addie'd have given the job to a blind man, and she didn't expect much out of Welcome. But in a week, the portly, fine-looking black woman, who was big enough to go bear hunting with a switch, had taken over as if she owned the place. She cooked and cleaned and kept the girls in line. Welcome even faced down the drunks with no better weapon than a fry pan. Addie wasn't sure why Welcome had come to Nalgitas; probably, she was drifting through, just like the girls. Maybe she was tired of moving around and wanted a place to call home. Addie hadn't asked. Why question good luck? When it's raining porridge, hold up your bowl. Addie just hoped that Welcome had kept the whores in line and was still there when she got home.</p><p>As Addie tucked the handkerchief into her fine bosom, the train stopped, jerked once, then shuddered as it settled into the depot. The conductor climbed off the car, holding a metal step, and set it down. He held out his hand to a woman who struggled with a heavy satchel. A farmer came forward and took it from her, and the two walked off, the woman following a few steps behind him. None of the half-dozen passengers who got off the train was greeted with hugs or cries of welcome. It wasn't just the heat. These were dour people, Addie knew. They rarely showed emotion; maybe they didn't have any. The crowd thinned out as the last of the passengers left the train. Those who remained on the platform gathered around the steps, anxious to board.</p><p>A man who stood out because his suit was too well tailored to be home-sewn--a banker, Addie decided with interest--pushed onto the train ahead of everyone else. Hoping the man was bound for Nalgitas, Addie leaned forward in her seat as he stopped in the aisle near her, forcing the other passengers to wait behind him. "Here. Ticket to Holden," he said, holding up a twenty-dollar gold piece so that everyone could see it. "Two dollars seventy," he added, as if the conductor didn't know the fare. The conductor pocketed the coin and gave the man a ticket. He counted the thirty cents out loud, then handed over a fistful of bills. Two of the dollar bills were folded, Addie observed. The conductor had shorted the passenger by two dollars. He'd done the same thing earlier with a woman in a shapeless coat and dirty scarf tied around a face as lumpy as a potato. Two little girls had held onto her skirt as she'd shifted the baby in her arms and taken out a bill. Anyone who'd cheat a poor immigrant was mean enough to whip his own grannie, and Addie had grabbed the conductor's wrist and pinched it hard. Then she'd told him in a low voice that if he didn't give the woman the correct change, she'd announce to the entire car what he'd done. The conductor handed the woman the rest of her money, but he'd given Addie a hard time after that, opening a window to let the dust blow in on her and taking liberties when she went out on the observation deck for air. Addie's left breast was sore from where he'd grabbed it and wrenched it hard, and she wondered if he'd left a bruise.</p><p>As the banker passed Addie, he curled his lip and moved to the far side of the aisle, kicking the hem of her dress out of his way. Did he think she was contagious? The gesture cost him two dollars. He could get swindled out of the whole damn gold piece for all Addie cared. She looked the conductor full in the face, then slid her eyes to the mark, letting the conductor know that even though she kept her mouth shut, she hadn't missed the cheat.</p><p>The conductor might be good enough to fool an immigrant woman and an unctuous banker, but not Addie French, the queen of the sleight-of-hand artists--the former queen, at any rate. Nobody gave short change like she did. There wasn't a man or woman in the Southwest who was better at palming, the switch, or the thimblerig than Addie French, and she didn't cheat poor foreign women, either. She'd tricked the best in the business.</p><p>She might still be at it if she hadn't picked the wrong mark, and he'd clubbed her. Addie still had a hurting in her bones sometimes from where she'd been beaten. After she recovered, she had taken a good look at her career and decided scamming was too dangerous. She'd learned her lesson. As good as she was, there was always someone out there who was sharp enough to catch her. Whoring wasn't as chancy, and the work was steady, easier on the nerves, too. Not that men wouldn't knock you around sometimes, but they didn't try to kill you out of meanness. By now, of course, Addie wasn't a whore herself anymore, except when she chose to be. She was a businesswoman. She owned a house. If the banker had been going to Nalgitas instead of Holden, she might have slipped him her business card. Men who snubbed you in the daytime didn't mind calling after dark.</p><p>Remembering the card, Addie fished in her reticule until she found the pasteboard, pulled it out, and admired it:</p><p>THE CHILI QUEEN</p><p>NALGITAS</p><p>MEN TAKEN IN AND DONE FOR</p><p>FOUR BOARDERS, FIRST RATE</p><p>MISS ADDIE FRENCH, PROP.</p><p>Actually, the four boarders included Addie herself, who filled in only now and then.</p><p>She had replenished her supply of cards in Kansas City and this time had added a gold border. It gave a touch of class. Addie ran her finger over the raised black letters and was about to return the card to her purse when she heard an angry male voice.</p><p>"Sit here. You shan't ride beside a man. You are foolish in the ways of the world, Emma. A traveling man isn't to be trusted, and you've not sense, but would let him start up a conversation with you. You're fool enough to talk to strangers. He won't take you if you're mauled, you know." He pushed a woman into the seat next to Addie, much to Addie's annoyance. The train was not crowded, and she'd expected to have the seat to herself.</p><p>Addie narrowed her eyes to take in the man, who wore black pants that ended above his shoe-tops and a coat that showed two inches of wrist. The coat was stretched across his broad back, and when he reached overhead to place a box on the brass rack, Addie saw the half-circles of sweat staining his underarms. Still, he was tall and lean, with thick black hair that was streaked with gray, and he was handsome, with high cheekbones and pale eyes, but his face was mean, and he snarled at the woman. "You're not to change seats. You hear me?"</p><p>"John," the woman pleaded. "Please. People are staring." She glanced at Addie, then turned her head away when she saw Addie watching her. The woman was a little younger than her husband. Under a large hat, her hair appeared to be the same glossy black. Her skin was whiter than his, and she had startling blue eyes. Addie, who was an expert in knowing what was hidden under corsets and petticoats, sized up the woman's body. She was tall and slender, girlish even, with small breasts and hips--not a body a customer would find at The Chili Queen, not a body like Addie's own generous, cottony one, with a bosom a man could sink into. But some men liked scrawny women, just as some men picked chicken wings over drumsticks.</p><p>"You're to pay mind to him. Don't sass him like you do me. If your opinion doesn't agree with his own, keep it to yourself. Don't act so pert, either."</p><p>Addie snorted and gave John the fish-eye. He sent her a hard look, then slid his eyes down to take in her silk dress, which was the shade of a brass watch--the same color as her hair. If he were as smart as he thought he was, he'd recognize her as a whore and order his wife to move, which would give Addie back the seat. Instead, he looked at Addie with such hatred as she had never seen on a man's face and told her, "Mind your business."</p><p>Addie raised an eyebrow and continued to stare.</p><p>"You know if you go, you can't come back. You wouldn't be welcome. I'd be shamed. This is your last chance," said the man in a voice so low that only the woman and Addie heard him. When the woman didn't reply, John sighed and said, "I told you already you were a fool, but you made your bed. Now you've got to sleep in it." He paused again, and his voice was even lower when he said, "Keep a sharp eye for investment. If it suits me, I'll pay him five percent. Might be he'd think better of you if you were to bring in a little money. He couldn't hardly think worse after what you've got yourself into."</p><p>"But that's our money, John. It's not just yours," the woman whispered fiercely.</p><p>"Well, I guess if it'd been meant for you, it'd been left to you, wouldn't it? 'Twas left to me to spend as I see fit."</p><p>"You know why that was."</p><p>John started to reply but when he saw Addie still watching, he pressed his lips together in a hard, straight line.</p><p>By then, the boarding passengers had found seats, and the conductor was looking up and down the tracks. "All aboard," he called.</p><p>John glanced up. "I got to git."</p><p>He took a step down the aisle, but the woman grabbed his coat. "Aren't you going to wish me luck?"</p><p>John stared at her for a long time, chewing his lip. Then without a word, he turned and left the car. As he jumped off the observation deck, the train lurched, and he landed on one leg and fell to the ground. Without looking back, he got up and limped away. Addie glanced at the woman, who leaned forward with alarm. Then a smile flickered across her face.</p><p>Neither woman spoke until the train slid away from the platform and moved onto the dry prairie. Emma--that was what the man had called her--got up and shoved a portmanteau onto the overhead rack, then pushed a hamper under the seat. The hamper interested Addie. She'd eaten the dinner she'd brought with her from Kansas City, and the only food available from the train butcher was meat sandwiches that were dotted with flyspecks.</p><p>Emma took off her bonnet, a shabby black silk that was too unattractive ever to have been fashionable, ironed the strings between two fingers, and carefully set the hat on the empty seat across the aisle. "He put my hatbox overhead, but it's already got two bonnets in it, so there's no place for this old thing," Emma told Addie.</p><p>Addie blinked and turned to her. Without the awful hat, the woman was a little prettier, although not what anybody would ever have called a beauty. She had strands of gray in her hair.</p><p>"They're stylish. One's pink. <i>He</i> doesn't know I have them."</p><p>"You going on a trip, are you?" was all Addie could think to say. John was right. His wife talked too much to strangers.</p><p>The woman nodded and introduced herself. "My name's Emma Roby."</p><p>"Where you going, Mrs. Roby?"</p><p>The woman laughed. "Oh, you think John's my husband. He's not. He's only my brother. I'm <i>Miss</i> Roby."</p><p>"Well, I'm Miss French. Miss Addie French."</p><p>"We're just like two maiden ladies on an adventure, then."</p><p>Addie thought that was an interesting way to put it.</p><p>"Do you want to see the hats?" the woman asked. Before Addie could answer, Emma jumped up and removed the hatbox from overhead. She unbuckled it and lifted the lid. "This is the pink one." Emma reached into a cloud of paper and brought out a bonnet the color of a baby's bottom, with ruffles and couching and long satin streamers, and thrust it into Addie's hands. "And there's this one, too." She removed a tiny round red hat that reminded Addie of a tin of Enameline the Modern Stove Polish that Welcome used to polish the stove at The Chili Queen. Even her girls wouldn't wear such silly bonnets. "I made them myself," the woman said shyly. "Even John says I'm an unusual smart woman with my fingers."</p><p>"Where are you going to wear a hat like that?" Addie nodded at the tin of stove polish.</p><p>"Nalgitas. It's in New Mexico."</p><p>Addie jerked up her head. "Nalgitas?"</p><p>Emma nodded.</p><p>"Hats like them wouldn't last a single dust storm. We get fierce dust."</p><p>Emma ran a deep blue ribbon on the red hat through her fingers and asked if Addie wa...</p></p><h2>American Cassandra: The Life of Dorothy Thompson</h2><p>Explores the remarkable life of the American journalist, discussing her advisory roles to Churchill and Roosevelt, her marriage to Sinclair Lewis, her lengthy career, and her troubled personal life</p><p></p><h2>Sunrise (Warriors: Power of Three #6)</h2><p><blockquote><p>There will be three, kin of your kin . . . who hold the power of the stars in their paws.</p></blockquote><p>The secret of Hollyleaf's, Jayfeather's, and Lionblaze's true identities has been revealed, but one shocking question remains unanswered.

In this fascinating book, Mario Livio tells the tale of a number at the heart of that mystery: <i>phi</i>, or 1.6180339887...This curious mathematical relationship, widely known as "The Golden Ratio," was discovered by Euclid more than two thousand years ago because of its crucial role in the construction of the pentagram, to which magical properties had been attributed. Since then it has shown a propensity to appear in the most astonishing variety of places, from mollusk shells, sunflower florets, and rose petals to the shape of the galaxy. Psychological studies have investigated whether the Golden Ratio is the most aesthetically pleasing proportion extant, and it has been asserted that the creators of the Pyramids and the Parthenon employed it.

Suspicion falls upon rancher Alton Hosfield, an armed separatist at war with the federal government and the local law&#x2014;with everyone, in fact, whom he perceives as a threat to his independent way of life. </p> <p> Joanna Brady suspects the solution is not so cut-and-dried&#x2014;especially when the cold-blooded slaying is followed by a series of others, equally horrific and perplexing. At best, an incendiary "Ruby Ridge" situation is brewing. At worst, a maniacal serial killer has come to feed on her unsuspecting community. But Joanna's preoccupation with bringing a murderer to justice could take a terrible toll on her private life . . . and unravel threads of family, love, and responsibility that might never again be retied. </p></p><p><i>Rattlesnake Crossing</i> is J.A. Jance's sixth novel in the acclaimed Joanna Brady series (readers may also be familiar with her Seattle-based J.P. Beaumont series). Brady is no tough-talking V.I. Warshawski or Kat Colorado; her appeal lies in her willingness to admit that her Cochise County sheriff's uniform is often an uneasy fit. As the single mother of a young daughter, Brady is prey to the pain and loneliness that have resulted from her husband's brutal murder, and she struggles to prove to herself and others that she is capable of bringing a cold-blooded killer to justice.<p> When Clyde Philips, a local gun dealer, dies violently, his stock of high-powered assault weapons vanishes, and two sniper slayings follow soon after, suspicion falls upon Alton Hosfield, an embittered rancher at odds with the federal government, the environmentalists, and anyone else he sees as a threat to his isolation. Sheriff Brady, however, suspects that the solution may lie elsewhere, and her investigation takes her into the bizarre practices of a local resort whose appeal is equal parts New Age spiritualism, Native American pantheism, and cold-blooded materialism.</p><p> Jance has a talent for weaving prosaic threads into a gripping mystery narrative. As a result, Brady must--in addition to tracking a vicious killer--cope with the impossibly high standards of her insufferable mother; the spiteful comments of Marliss Shackleford, an old high school rival and current gossip columnist for the <i>Bisbee Bee</i>; and some rather unexpected news from Butch Dixon, her would-be ardent suitor. As with earlier Brady mysteries, the domestic context provides a deliciously ironic backdrop for the game of psychological cat-and-mouse being played in the Arizona desert. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Single and distant from her family, she wants a husband and children of her own. One night, after yet another disastrous Internet date, she turns on her police radio to help herself fall asleep&#x2014;and receives an alert that sends her to a puzzling crime scene.<br><br> Edith Hind&#x2014;a beautiful graduate student at Cambridge University and daughter of the surgeon to the Royal Family&#x2014;has been missing for nearly twenty-four hours. Her home offers few clues: a smattering of blood in the kitchen, her keys and phone left behind, the front door ajar but showing no signs of forced entry. Manon instantly knows that this case will be big&#x2014;and that every second is crucial to finding Edith alive.<br><br> The investigation starts with Edith&#x2019;s loved ones: her attentive boyfriend, her reserved best friend, her patrician parents. As the search widens and press coverage reaches a frenzied pitch, secrets begin to emerge about Edith&#x2019;s tangled love life and her erratic behavior leading up to her disappearance. With no clear leads, Manon summons every last bit of her skill and intuition to close the case, and what she discovers will have shocking consequences not just for Edith&#x2019;s family but for Manon herself.<br><br> Suspenseful and keenly observed, <i>Missing, Presumed</i> is a brilliantly twisting novel of how we seek connection, grant forgiveness, and reveal the truth about who we are.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Missing, Presumed</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Smart, stylish . . .

Manon tells herself to focus on the man sitting opposite, whose name might be Brian but could equally be Keith, who is crossing his legs and his foot bangs her shin just where the bone is nearest the surface. She reaches down to rub it but he&#x2019;s oblivious.<br><br>&#x201c;Sensitive,&#x201d; his profile had said, along with an interest in military aircraft. She wonders now what on earth she was thinking when she arranged it, but then compatibility seemed no marker for anything. The last date with a town planner scored 78 percent&#x2014;�she&#x2019;d harbored such hopes; he even liked Thomas Hardy&#x2014;�yet Manon spent the evening flinching each time his spittle landed on her face, which was remarkably often.<br><br>Two years of Internet dating. It&#x2019;s fair to say they haven&#x2019;t flown by.<br><br>He&#x2019;s turned his face so the light hits the thumbprints on his glasses: petroleum-�purple eggs, the kind of oval spiral they dream of finding at a crime scene. He&#x2019;s talking about his job with the Rivers Authority while she looks up gratefully to the waiter who is filling their wineglasses&#x2014;�well, her glass, because her companion isn&#x2019;t drinking.<br><br>She&#x2019;s endured far worse than this, of course, like the one she traveled all the way to London for. &#x201c;Keep an open mind,&#x201d; Bri had urged. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know where the man of your dreams might pop up.&#x201d; He was tall and very thin and he stooped like an undertaker going up the escalator at Tate Modern&#x2014;�giving it his best Uriah Heep. Manon thought that escalator ride was never going to end, and when she finally got to the top, she turned without a word and came straight back down, leaving him standing at the summit, staring at her. She got on the first train out of King&#x2019;s Cross, back to Huntingdon, as if fleeing the scent of decomposing flesh. Every officer on the Major Incident Team knew that smell, the way it stuck to your clothes.<br><br>This one&#x2014;�she&#x2019;s looking at him now, whatever his name is, Darren or Barry&#x2014;�isn&#x2019;t so much morbid as effacing. He is talking about newts; she&#x2019;s vaguely aware of this. Now he&#x2019;s raising his eyebrows&#x2014;�&#x201c;Shopping trolleys!&#x201d;&#x2014;�and she supposes he&#x2019;s making a wry comment about how often they&#x2019;re dumped in streams. She really must engage.<br><br>&#x201c;So, one week till Christmas,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;How are you spending it?&#x201d;<br><br>He looks annoyed that she&#x2019;s diverted him from the flow of his rivers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a brother in Norwich,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I go to him. He&#x2019;s got kids.&#x201d; He seems momentarily disappointed and she likes him the more for it.<br><br>&#x201c;Not an easy time, Christmas. When you&#x2019;re on your own, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have a pretty good time, me and Col, once we crack open the beers. We&#x2019;re a right double act.&#x201d;<br><br>Perhaps his name&#x2019;s Terry, she thinks sadly. Too late to ask now. &#x201c;Shall we get the bill?&#x201d; He hasn&#x2019;t even asked about her name&#x2014;�and most men do (&#x201c;Manon, that&#x2019;s a funny name. Is it Welsh?&#x201d;)&#x2014;�but in a sense it&#x2019;s a relief, the way he just plows on.<br><br>The waiter brings the bill and it lies lightly curled on a white saucer with two mint imperials.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we split it?&#x201d; says Manon, throwing a card onto the saucer. He is sucking on a mint, looking at the bill.<br><br>&#x201c;To be fair,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have any wine. Here.&#x201d; He shows her the items on the bill that were hers&#x2014;�carafe of red and a side salad.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, right, OK,&#x201d; she says, while he gets out his phone and begins totting up. The windows are fogged and Manon peers at the misty halos of Huntingdon&#x2019;s festive lights. It&#x2019;ll be a cold walk home past the shuttered-�up shops on the high street, the sad, beery air emanating from Cromwell&#x2019;s, and out toward the river, its refreshing green scent and its movement a slithering in the darkness, to her flat, where she has left all the lights burning.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours comes to twenty-�three eighty-�five. Mine&#x2019;s only eleven pounds,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you want to check?&#x201d;<br><br>Midnight, and Manon sits with her knees up on the window seat, looking down at the snowy street lit by orange streetlamps. Flakes float down on their leisurely journey, buffeting, tissue-�light. The freezing draft coming in through the sash frame makes her hug her knees to her chest as she watches him&#x2014;�Frank? Bernard?&#x2014;�round the corner of her street and disappear.<br><br>When she&#x2019;s sure he&#x2019;s gone, she walks a circuit of the lounge, turning off the lamps. To give him credit, he was stopped short by her flat&#x2014;�&#x201c;Whoa, this is where you live?&#x201d;&#x2014;�but his interest was short-�lived and he soon recommenced his monologue. Perhaps, now she comes to think of it, she slept with him to shut him up.<br><br>The walls of the lounge are Prussian blue. The shelving on which the television stands is fifties G Plan in walnut. Her sofa is a circular design in brown corduroy. Two olive-�green velvet wing chairs sit to each side of it and beside one is a yellow-�domed seventies floor lamp, which she has just switched off at the plug because the switch is busted. The d�cor is a homage to mid-�century modern, like a film set, with every detail of a piece. The scene for a post-�ironic East German comedy perhaps, or Abigail&#x2019;s Party; a place absolutely bursting with taste of a charismatic kind, all of it chosen by the flat&#x2019;s previous owners. Manon bought the lot&#x2014;�furniture, lamps, and all&#x2014;�together with the property itself, from a couple who were going abroad to &#x201c;start afresh.&#x201d; At least, that&#x2019;s what the man had said. &#x201c;We just want to shed, you know?&#x201d; To which Manon replied, &#x201c;Shed away. I&#x2019;ll take the lot.&#x201d; And his girlfriend looked around her, swallowing down her tears. She told Manon how she&#x2019;d collected all of it, lovingly, on eBay. &#x201c;Still, fresh start,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Manon makes her way to the bedroom, which at the point of sale was even more starkly dramatic: dark navy walls with white-�painted floorboards and shutters; a whole bank of white wardrobes, handle-�less and disappearing into themselves. You had to do a Marcel Marceau impression to discover the pressure points at which to open them.<br><br>The previous owners had a minimalist mattress on the floor and a disheveled white duvet. Under Manon&#x2019;s tenure, however, this room has lost much of its allure: books stacked by the bed, covered with a film of dust; a cloudy glass of water; wires trailing the floor from her police radio to the plug, and among them gray fluff and human hair, coiling like DNA. Her motley collection of shoes makes opening the cupboards additionally tricky. She kicks at a discarded pair of pants on the floor, rolled about themselves like a croissant, throws off her dressing gown (100 percent polyester, keep away from fire and flame), and retrieves, from under the bedclothes in which he has incongruously lain, her flannelette nightie.<br><br>Up close he smelled musty. And vaguely sweet. But above all, foreign. Was this her experiment&#x2014;�bringing him close, out of the world of strangers? Was she trying him out? Or smelling him out, as if intimacy might transform him into something less ordinary? People who know her&#x2014;�well, Bryony mainly&#x2014;�disapprove of her emotional &#x201c;immaturity,&#x201d; but the fact is human beings are different up close. You find out more through smell and touch than any chat about newts or shopping trolleys. She becomes her mammalian self, using her senses to choose a mate. She&#x2019;s read somewhere that smell is the most efficient way of selecting from the gene pool to ensure the best immune system in offspring. So she puts out on the first date! She&#x2019;s a scientist at the mating frontline.<br><br>In her darker moments&#x2014;�and she can feel their approach even now&#x2014;�she wonders if she is simply filling an awkward gap in the conversation. Instead of a ghastly shuffling of feet and &#x201c;Well, that was nice, but we should probably leave it there,&#x201d; she forces the moment to its crisis. It&#x2019;s like running yourself over to avoid shaking hands.<br><br>In the bathroom, she picks up her toothbrush and lays along it a slug of toothpaste, watching herself in the mirror as she brushes. Here is the flaw in her argument: the sex was pretty much a reflection of the night&#x2019;s conversation&#x2014;�all newts and shopping trolleys and a definite lack of tumultuous waterfalls or even babbling brooks, if you wanted to pursue the waterways analogy.<br><br>She looks at the springy coils of her hair, bobbing ringlets, brown mostly but with the odd blond one poking out like a rogue pasta twirl&#x2014;�spit&#x2014;�unruly and energetic, as if she is some child in a playground, and discordant now&#x2014;�spit&#x2014;�that she is on the cusp of her forties. She can feel herself gliding into that invisible&#x2014;�gargle&#x2014;�phase of womanhood, alongside those pushing prams or pulling shopping wheelies. She is drawn to the wider fittings in Clarks, has begun to have knee trouble, and is disturbed to find that clipping her toenails leaves her vaguely out of puff. She wonders what other indignities aging will throw at her and how soon. A few centuries ago she&#x2019;d be dead, having had eight children by the age of twenty-�five. Nature doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with a childless woman of thirty-�nine, except throw her that fertility curveball&#x2014;�aches and pains combined with extra time, like some terrifying end to a high-�stakes football match.<br><br>She wipes a blob of foam off her chin with a towel. Eventually, he asked about her name (her moment in the sun!) and she told him it meant &#x201c;bitter&#x201d; in Hebrew, and she lay back on the pillow, remembering how her mother had squeezed her secondary-�school shoulders and told her how much she&#x2019;d loved it, how &#x201c;Manon&#x201d; was her folly, much as her father objected. A Marmite name, you either loved it or loathed it, and her mother loved it, she said, because it was &#x201c;all held down,&#x201d; those &#x201c;n&#x201d;s like tent pegs in the ground.<br><br>There was silence, in which she supposed he wanted her to ask about his name, which she couldn&#x2019;t really, because she wasn&#x2019;t sure what it was. She could have said, &#x201c;What about yours?&#x201d; as a means of finding out, but by that point it seemed unnecessary. She had smelled him out and found him wanting. Her mind was set on how to get him out of her flat, which she did by saying, &#x201c;Right, then, early start tomorrow,&#x201d; and holding open her bedroom door.<br><br>She smooths out the pillow and duvet where he&#x2019;s been and pushes her feet down under the covers, reaching out an arm from the bed to switch on the radio, with its sticker reminding her it remains &#x201c;Property of Cambridgeshire Police.&#x201d; A cumbersome bit of kit, and no one at detective sergeant rank is supposed to have one at home, but it is not a plaything. It is the method by which she overcomes insomnia. Some rely on the shipping forecast; Manon prefers low murmurings about road traffic accidents or drunken altercations outside Level 2 Nightclub on All Saints Passage, all of which she can safely ignore because they are far too lowly for the Major Incident Team.<br><br>&#x201c;VB, VB, mobile unit to Northern Bypass, please; that&#x2019;s the A141, junction with Main Street. UDAA.&#x201d;<br><br>Unlawfully Driving Away an Automobile. Someone&#x2019;s nicked some wheels. Off you pop, Plod. The voice begins to sound very far away as Manon&#x2019;s eyelids grow heavy, the burbling of the radio merging into a pebbly blur behind her eyes. The clicks, switches, whirring, receivers picked up and put down, colleagues conferred with, buttons pressed to receive. To Manon, it is the sound of vigilance, this rapid response to hurt and misdeed. It is human kindness in action, protecting the good against the bad. She sleeps.<br><br>Sunday<br><br>Miriam<br><br>Miriam is washing up, looking out over the bleak winter garden&#x2014;�the lawn smooth as Christmas icing. She&#x2019;d have liked a bigger garden, but this is about as good as it gets in Hampstead.<br><br>She&#x2019;s thinking about Edith, her hands inside rubber gloves in the sink, washing up the Le Creuset after lunch&#x2019;s monkfish stew. The pancetta has stuck around the edges and she is going at it with a scourer. She&#x2019;s so lucky, she thinks, to have a girl, because girls look after you when you get old. Boys just leave home, eventually going to live cheek by jowl with their mothers-�in-�law.<br><br>And then she curses herself, because it goes against all her feminist principles&#x2014;�requiring her daughter, her clever Cambridge-�educated daughter, to wipe her wrinkly old bottom and bring her meals and audiobooks, probably while juggling toddlers and some pathetic attempt at a career. Her own career hadn&#x2019;t recovered from having the children, those three days a week at the GP surgery feeling like time-�filling in between bouts of household management.<br><br>Feminism, she thinks, has a long way to go before men take on the detritus of family life&#x2014;�not the spectacular bread and butter pudding, brought out to &#x201c;oohs&#x201d; and &#x201c;aahs&#x201d; (which always has the whiff of Man makes pudding! Round of applause!), but ordering bin liners and making sure there are enough lightbulbs. When the children were little, Miriam felt as if she were being buried under sand drifts from the Sahara: music lessons, homework folders, kids&#x2019; parties, thank-�you notes, fresh fruit, and meter readings. It silted up the corners of her mind until there was no space for anything else. Ian sidestepped it with strategic incompetence so that his mind remained free to focus on Important Things (such as work, or reading an interesting book). It was one of the biggest shocks of adult life&#x2014;�the injustice&#x2014;�and no one had warned her about it, certainly not her mother, who felt it was only right and proper that Miriam take on the more organizational tasks in life because she was &#x201c;so good at them.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d better not think about it now, or she&#x2019;ll get too angry.<br><br>She lifts the Le Creuset onto the white ceramic draining board, wondering why people rave about the things when they are almost un-�lift-�able and scratch everything they touch. Ian hasn&#x2019;t made it home for lunch so she&#x2019;s eaten the stew by herself, struggling to lift the damn heavy pot in order to pour the remains into a Tupperware box and struggling also not to feel hard done by. She&#x2019;s alone so much these days, in part because when the sand drifts receded, along with the departure of the children, they left an excess of time, while Ian&#x2019;s existence maintained its steady course, which was essentially Rushing About, Being Important. She has to fight, very often, not to take umbrage at the separations and also their converse, to retain some sense of herself in their togetherness.

In "Consider the Lobster," the author rambles around the Rockland [Maine] Lobster Festival, a veritable orgy of lobster murder, speculating on the morality of cooking and eating a sentient creature. In the next piece, "The View From Mrs. Thompson's," listeners feel the effects of 9/11 on ordinary folks in middle America. Later, in "The Big Red Son," Wallace attends the Adult Video News awards and faithfully records the comments of some of the sleaze-mongers and stars of the porn film industry, and he positively unstrings the tennis star's autobiography in "How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart." Wallace reads his fresh, provocative essays with delicious irreverence, earning his place alongside the great social satirists of this, or any, time.

In later years, his black-and-white illustrations, water colors, and oil paintings earned him a considerable reputation. To accompany his drawings, he often wrote stories for young people, stories of chivalry and adventure that reflected the pageantry of the Middle Ages.Men of Iron<br>CHAPTER 1Myles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time, and it was only afterwards, and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs of the matter, that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that afterwards happened; how one evening a knight came clattering into the court-yard upon a horse, red-nostrilled and smeared with the sweat and foam of a desperate ride--Sir John Dale, a dear friend of the blind Lord.Even though so young, Myles knew that something very serious had happened to make Sir John so pale and haggard, and he dimly remembered leaning against the knight's iron-covered knees, looking up into his gloomy face, and asking him if he was sick to look so strange. Thereupon those who had been too troubled before to notice him, bethought themselves of him, and sent him to bed, rebellious at having to go so early.He remembered how the next morning, looking out of a window high up under the eaves, he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the court-yard beneath, where a powdering of snow had whitened everything, and of how the leader, a knight clad in black armor, dismounted and enteredthe great hall doorway below, followed by several of the band.He remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened group upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voices about a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who had ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale. None of the women paid any attention to him; so, shunning their notice, he ran off down the winding stairs, expecting every moment to be called back again by some one of them.A crowd of castle people, all very serious and quiet, were gathered in the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon the benches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood guarding the great door, the butts of their weapons resting upon the ground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.In the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen from the window. He was sitting at the table, his great helmet lying upon the bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. A clerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one hand and pen in the other, and a parchment spread in front of him.Master Robert, the castle steward, stood before the knight, who every now and then put to him a question, which the other would answer, and the clerk write the answer down upon the parchment.His father stood with his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the scar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at York--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his forehead, as it always did when he was angered or troubled.There was something about it all that frightened Myles, who crept to his father's side, and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and inert. In answer to the touch, his father grasped the hand tightly, but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there. Neither did the black knight pay any attention to him, but continued putting his questions to Master Robert.Then, suddenly, there was a commotion in the hall without, loud voices, and a hurrying here and there. The black knight half arose, grasping a heavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him, and the next moment Sir John Dale himself, as pale as death, walked into the antechamber. He stopped in the very middle of the room. "I yield me to my Lord's grace and mercy," said he to the black knight, and they were the last words he ever uttered in this world.The black knight shouted out some words of command, and swinging up the iron mace in his hand, strode forward clanking towards Sir John, who raised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow. Two or three of those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with drawn swords and bills, and little Myles, crying out with terror, hid his face in his father's long gown.The next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan, then another blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground. Then the clashing of steel, and in the midst Lord Falworth crying, in a dreadful voice, "Thou traitor! thou coward! thou murderer!"Master Robert snatched Myles away from his father, and bore him out of the room in spite of his screams and struggles, and he remembered just one instant's sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face, and of the black knight standing above him, with the terrible mace in his hand stained a dreadful red.It was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles, together with three of the more faithful of their people, left the castle.His memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowman standing over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his hand, and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would have spoken, and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women, bewildered with sleep, shuddering and chattering with cold.He remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of his bed, and of being carried in Diccon Bowman's arms down the silent darkness of the winding stair-way,with the great black giant shadows swaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp swayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air.Below were his father and mother and two or three others. A stranger stood warming his hands at a newly-made fire, and little Myles, as he peeped from out the warm sheepskin, saw that he was in riding-boots and was covered with mud. He did not know till long years afterwards that the stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King's court, bidding his father fly for safety.They who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still, talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes, and Myles's mother hugged him in her arms, sheepskin and all, kissing him, with the tears streaming down her cheeks, and whispering to him, as though he could understand their trouble, that they were about to leave their home forever.Then Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter midnight.Outside, beyond the frozen moat, where the osiers stood stark and stiff in their winter nakedness, was a group of dark figures waiting for them with horses. In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well-known face of Father Edward, the Prior of St. Mary's.After that came a long ride through that silent night upon the saddle-bow in front of Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, that fell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses.When next he woke the sun was shining, and his home and his whole life were changed.All new material copyright � 2006 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC</p><h2>When the Game Was Ours</h2><p>From the moment these two players took the court on opposing sides, they engaged in a fierce physical and psychological battle. Their uncommonly competitive relationship came to symbolize the most compelling rivalry in the NBA. These were the basketball epics of the 1980s--Celtics vs Lakers, East vs West, physical vs finesse, Old School vs Showtime, even white vs black. Each pushed the other to greatness--together Bird and Johnson collected 8 NBA Championships, and 6 MVP awards and helped save the floundering NBA at its most critical time. When it started they were bitter rivals, but along the way they became lifelong friends. <p></p> With intimate, fly-on-the-wall detail, <i>When the Game Was Ours</i> transports readers to this electric era of basketball and reveals for the first time the inner workings of two players dead set on besting one another. From the heady days of trading championships to the darker days of injury and illness, we come to understand Larry's obsessive devotion to winning and how his demons drove him on the court. We hear him talk with candor about playing through chronic pain and its truly exacting toll. In Magic we see a young, invincible star struggle with the sting of defeat, not just as a player but as a team leader. We are there the moment he learns he's contracted HIV and hear in his own words how that devastating news impacted his relationships in basketball and beyond. But always, in both cases, we see them prevail.<p></p> A compelling, up-close-and-personal portrait of basketball's most inimitable duo, <i>When the Game Was Ours</i> is a reevaluation of three decades in counterpoint. It is also a rollicking ride through professional basketball's best times.</p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: Bill Walton Reviews <i>When the Game Was Ours</i></b> <br> <br> <strong>Bill Walton played in the NBA for 13 years, and in 1996, was named one of the top 50 players in NBA history.

Read his guest review of <i>When the Game Was Ours</i>:</strong> <br> </p><p> Larry Bird and Magic Johnson are transcendent, iconic and timeless standard bearers of excellence who changed "The Game" forever, always bringing out the best in each other and never failing to put a smile on all our faces.</p><p></p> I was one of the lucky ones. I had the incredible good fortune to have witnessed firsthand the Bird/Magic rivalry. It was an intense and constant thing for us all. But even I didn't realize how powerful their connection was until I read <i>When the Game Was Ours</i>, a riveting and page-turning masterpiece that could only be written with the help of someone like Jackie MacMullan, who was there every step of the way and who sensed there was a whole lot more to their story than what happened on the court or got played over and over again on the highlight reels. In this book, Larry and Magic tell stories like they never have before. I was enthralled, page after page. Theirs was a unique relationship. They were polar opposites, but in ways few of us realized they were very much the same. They both wanted the same thing, day in and day out--to win. And did they know how to win.<p></p> <i>When the Game Was Ours</i> perfectly captures the defining moments of their lives from the very beginning of their fiercest of rivalries through their constantly evolving historical relationship and friendship right up to the present. This epic tome is the capstone of their landmark careers. It is also so much more than anyone could ever dream for. <i>When the Game Was Ours</i> brilliantly explains why "The Game" will always belong to Larry and Magic.--<i>Bill Walton</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Joe Faraoni/ESPN)</p> <br> <br> <p><b>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Larry Bird and Magic Johnson</b><br> </p><p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> It was interesting to learn that a fast break during an exhibition game sparked the start of your long friendship. Talk about that play and how it set the stage for future Bird vs. Magic battles.<p></p> <b>Larry Bird:</b> What I remember about that play was we had the defender spinning around like a top because we moved the ball so quickly. I had never played with anyone who could pass the ball like Magic. I was blown away by the things he was doing on the court. But once we were done as teammates on that All-Star team, I moved on. And, a year later, when we played against each other for the NCAA championship, I treated him like he was just another guy. I wasn't too big on being friendly with people I was trying to beat. I think that upset him, but I didn't care. I was always taught, "Don't talk to the enemy."<p></p> <b>Earvin "Magic" Johnson:</b> I already knew about Larry before we played in the World Invitational Tournament. I was dying to meet this guy who went to Indiana, quit school, worked on a garbage truck, then came back and started putting up really big numbers for Indiana State. We played on the second team together during those exhibitions, and the way we moved the ball, we were better than the starters! That one play was so fast, so amazing, those Russian players had no idea what hit them. We didn't spend a whole lot of time together off the court, because Larry kept to himself, but I was real excited the following spring when I realized our Michigan State team was going to play his Indiana State team for the NCAA championship. I went over to say hello to him at the press conference a day or two before the game, and he totally blew me off. I couldn't believe it. I left thinking, "That Larry Bird, he's kind of a jerk." And the rivalry was on.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Where did you each develop your love for the game?<p></p> <b>Bird:</b> My two older brothers, Mike and Mark, played basketball all day long. They were bigger and stronger than me, so they were better in the beginning. But I loved the way it felt when the ball dropped through the strings, so I was out there all the time, day and night, working on my game. I wasn't going to stop until I could beat my brothers. And by the time that happened, I was hooked on the game. I couldn't live without it.<p></p> <b>Johnson:</b> I honestly can't remember a time when basketball wasn't a part of my life. I grew up in a big family, so we played all kinds of sports, including basketball. I loved the way the ball felt in my hands. I took my ball with me everywhere--to school, to the store, to the school dances. People in Lansing, Michigan, got used to seeing me walking down the street dribbling my ball. I wasn't going to stop until I was in the NBA.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> If you could each replay one game from the past, which would it be and why?<p></p> <b>Bird:</b> I'd like to go back to the 1987 Finals, to the game when Magic sunk his junior junior hook. It was down to the final seconds, and Magic had Kevin McHale isolated out on the wing, and when he drove past him to the basket, our center, Robert Parish, came over to help, and I came over from the weak side, but probably a second too late. I never expected Magic to shoot a hook. I had never seen him do anything like that before. People forget that even after that basket, we still had a chance to pull it out. I got a great look from the baseline in the final seconds, but the shot rolled off. If I could go back and replay that game, maybe we would have won it, and possibly the series as well.<p></p> <b>Johnson:</b> That's easy. I'd go back to Game 2 of the 1984 Finals, when we were in Boston and about to take a 2&#x2013;0 lead in the series, and instead I called a time-out in the final seconds. If I hadn't called it, we would have run out the clock and taken total command of the series. Instead, because of the time-out, the Celtics were able to set their defense, and James Worthy's pass was intercepted by Gerald Henderson. That was one of the most disappointing losses of my career, and I've never forgotten it.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> One of the most powerful moments in the book surrounds November 7, 1991--the day Magic announced he was HIV positive. Magic, why was it so important to you to contact Larry before the news hit?<p></p> <b>Johnson:</b> You've got to understand that by this point, we're like Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali. Nobody talked about one of us without mentioning the other. We were that connected. I knew the minute the news hit, people would be flocking to get a reaction from both Larry and Michael Jordan, so I felt I had to give them some warning. Also, by then, Larry and I had developed a bit of a relationship. In spite of all our battles, I felt a real affection for him. He needed to know, and he needed to know from me.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Larry, what do you remember most about that day?<p></p> <b>Bird:</b> The feeling I had in the pit of my stomach. It was a horrible, awful feeling. I just remember lying in my room, trying to take a nap, and all I could think about was that Magic would be dead soon. At that time, we didn't know much about HIV. We all just assumed he had been given a death sentence, and that was really shocking to think about.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> How did winning a gold medal with the 1992 Dream Team compare to winning an NBA championship?<p></p> <b>Johnson:</b> That whole experience in Barcelona was amazing, fantastic. At that point, I was technically retired from the NBA because of my HIV illness, and I missed basketball so much. To be out there playing for my country, not to mention alongside Larry and Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing, was one of the biggest thrills of my life. I savored every single moment of it.<p></p> <b>Bird:</b> It was a little harder for me because my back was in such bad shape, and sometimes it was hard for me to enjoy it because of the pain. I just wanted to get into a game and make a contribution and be able to say I did it, that I was part of an Olympic team. And once I did that, I was happy. My goals were pretty realistic in Barcelona. Still, I didn't realize how amazing it would feel to be up on that medal stand, alongside Magic, John Stockton, Patrick, and all the guys, with that gold medal around my neck. That is one special memory.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Who carries the NBA torch today?<p></p> <b>Johnson:</b> There's some great young talent out there, but I've got to choose the Laker, Kobe Bryant. I think he proved in the 2009 NBA championship that he learned how to balance his own individual skills with those of his teammates. That was a big step forward for him. What I liked best about Kobe was watching him enjoy himself. The game is supposed to be fun. Larry and I never lost sight of that.<p></p> <b>Bird:</b> You certainly couldn't go wrong choosing Kobe, but I'm a LeBron James man. He is so strong. He's also fearless, and he's convinced he can do anything. That's what stands out to me. He still has some steps to take, like bringing the same effort defensively every night that he brings on the offensive end, but he has all the tools to accomplish that. He's going to have a long, successful career that will include some championships of his own.<p></p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> If you both laced 'em up right now, who would win one-on-one in H-O-R-S-E?<p></p> <b>Bird:</b> Nobody beats me in H-O-R-S-E. Besides, Magic can't shoot.<p></p> <b>Johnson:</b> Larry, you'd have no chance against me one-on-one. I've got too many ways to beat you. Plus, as slow as I am, I'm still faster than you.<br> <p>(Photo � Marc Serota RRA Media)</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Photographs from <i>When the Game Was Ours</i></b><br> <b>(Click on images to enlarge)</b> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Magic and his high school coach George Fox</td> <td>Larry and his mother Georgia in Salt Lake City, 1979</td> <td>Magic and Larry in a pregame meeting of team captains</td> <td>Larry and Magic for a NBA promotional campaign</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Larry and Magic in between takes of the 1985 Converse commercial</td> <td>Larry, Commissioner David Stern and Magic</td> <td>Larry, Michael Jordan, and Magic in their Dream Team uniforms</td> <td>Magic congratulates Larry at his retirement ceremony</td> </tr> </tbody></table>Larry Bird, in his 13 seasons with the Boston Celtics, claimed 3 NBA titles, 3 MVP awards, and was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.

He held out his beefy paw and said, "Glad I caught you in." </p><p> "Uh-huh." I stepped down to meet him. I shook his hand and looked into his eyes. </p><p> When I didn't say anything there was an uncomfortable moment for the Los Angeles police sergeant.

But something about Naylor's request kept me from turning him down. There was a kind of defeat in the policeman's plea. Defeat goes down hard with black people; it's our most common foe. </p><p> "Where we gonna go?" </p><p> "It's not far. Twelve blocks. Hundred and Tenth Street." He turned as he spoke and headed for the street. </p><p> I yelled into the house, "I'm goin' fo' a ride with Officer Naylor. I'll be back in a while." </p><p> "What?" Regina called from her ironing board out back. </p><p> "I'm goin' out for a while," I yelled. Then I waved at my forty-foot avocado tree. </p><p> Little Jesus peeked out from his perch up there and smiled. </p><p> "Come on down here," I said. </p><p> The little Mexican boy climbed down the tree and ran up to me with a silent smile stitched across his face. He had the face of an ancient American, dark and wise. </p><p> "I don't want you off exploring today, Jesus," I said. "Stay around here and look after your mother and Edna." </p><p> Jesus looked at his feet and nodded. </p><p> "Look up here at me." I did all the talking when around Jesus because he hadn't said a word in the eight years I'd known him. </p><p> Jesus squinted up at me. </p><p> "I want you close to home. Understand me?" </p><p> Quinten was at his car, looking at his watch. </p><p> Jesus nodded, looking me in the eye this time. </p><p> "All right." I rubbed his crew-cut peach fuzz and went out to meet the cop.</p><p> </p><p> Officer Naylor drove me to an empty lot in the middle of the 1200 block of 110th Street. There was an ambulance parked out front, flanked by patrol cars. I noticed a bright patent-leather white pump in the gutter as we crossed the street. </p><p> A crowd had gathered on the sidewalk. Seven white police officers stood shoulder to shoulder across the front of the property, keeping everybody out. The feeling was festive. The policemen were all at ease, smoking cigarettes and joking with the Negro gawkers. </p><p> The lot itself was decorated with two rusted-out Buicks that were hunkered down on broken axles in the weeds. A knotty oak had died toward the back end of the lot. </p><p> Quinten and I walked through the crowd. There were men, women, and children stretching their necks and bobbing back and forth. A boy said, "Lloyd saw'er. She dead." </p><p> When we walked past the line of policemen one of them caught me by the arm and said, "Hey you, son." </p><p> Quinten gave him a hard stare and the officer said, "Oh, okay. You can go on." </p><p> Just one of the many white men I've shrugged off. His instinctive disrespect and arrogance hardly even mattered. I turned away and he was gone from my life. </p><p> "Right this way, Mr. Rawlins," Quinten Naylor said. </p><p> There were four plainclothes policemen looking down at the back of the tree. I couldn't make out what it was that they saw. </p><p> I recognized one of the cops. He was a burly white man, the kind of fat man who was fat everywhere, even in his face and hands. </p><p> "Mr. Rawlins," the burly man said. He held out a pillowy hand. </p><p> "You remember my partner," Quinten said. "Roland Hobbes." </p><p> We'd come around the tree by then. There was a woman in a pink party dress, a little open at the breast, sitting with her back against the trunk. Her legs were straight out in front of her, a little apart. Her head tilted to the side, away from me, and her hands were on either side of her thighs with the palms up. Her left foot sported a white pump, her right foot was bare. </p><p> I remember the softness and the underlying strength of Roland Hobbes's hand and the insect I saw perched on the woman's temple. I wondered why she didn't bat it away. </p><p> "Nice to see you," I was saying to Hobbes when I realized that the insect was a dried knot of blood. </p><p> When Roland let go of my hand he listed toward Quinten and said, "Same thing." </p><p> "Both?" Quinten asked. </p><p> Roland nodded. </p><p> The girl was young and pretty. It was hard for me to think that she was dead. It seemed as if she might get up from there any minute and smile and tell me her name. </p><p> Somebody whispered, "Third one." </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � by 1992 by Walter Mosley</p></p><h2>Christian Caregiving: A Way of Life</h2><p>Will challenge and equip readers to care for others in a distinctively Christian way and help them feel comfortable talking about their faith, praying with others and trying to comfort a friend?</p><p>Kenneth C.

Swift and Defoe used his experiences as inspiration in writing <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. Captain Cook relied on his observations while voyaging around the world. Coleridge called him a genius and "a man of exquisite mind." In the history of exploration, nobody has ventured further than Englishman William Dampier. Yet while the exploits of Cook, Shackleton, and a host of legendary explorers have been widely chronicled, those of perhaps the greatest are virtually invisible today&#x2015;an omission that Diana and Michael Preston have redressed in this vivid, compelling biography.</p><p>As a young man Dampier spent several years in the swashbuckling company of buccaneers in the Caribbean. At a time when surviving one voyage across the Pacific was cause for celebration, Dampier ultimately journeyed three times around the world; his bestselling books about his experiences were a sensation, influencing generations of scientists, explorers, and writers. He was the first to deduce that winds cause currents and the first to produce wind maps across the world, surpassing even the work of Edmund Halley. He introduced the concept of the "sub-species" that Darwin later built into his theory of evolution, and his description of the breadfruit was the impetus for Captain Bligh's voyage on the Bounty. Dampier reached Australia 80 years before Cook, and he later led the first formal expedition of science and discovery there. </p><p><i>A Pirate of Exquisite Mind</i> restores William Dampier to his rightful place in history&#x2015;one of the pioneers on whose insights our understanding of the natural world was built.</p></p><p><p>Born and raised in London, <b>Diana Preston</b> studied Modern History at Oxford University, where she first became involved in journalism. After earning her degree, she became a freelance writer of feature and travel articles for national UK newspapers and magazines and has subsequently reviewed books for a number of publications, including <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>. She has also been a broadcaster for the BBC and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and has been featured in various television documentaries.</p><p><i>A Pirate of Exquisite Mind: Explorer, Naturalist and Buccaneer: The Life of William Dampier </i>(Walker &amp; Company, April 2004) is a new biography of the 17th-century British explorer, naturalist, scientist, pirate and buccaneer William Dampier coauthored by Diana and her husband, <b>Michael Preston</b>.</p><p>Diana's decision to write "popular" history led her to <i>The Road to Culloden Moor: Bonnie Prince Charlie and the '45 Rebellion</i> (Constable UK, 1995). It was followed by <i>A First Rate Tragedy: Robert Falcon Scott and the Race to the South Pole</i> (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), <i>The Boxer Rebellion</i> (Walker &amp; Company, 2000), and <i>Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy</i> (Walker &amp; Company, 2002). </p><p>When not writing, Diana and Michael are avid travelers. Together, they have sojourned throughout India, Asia, Africa, and Antarctica, and have climbed Mount Kinabalu in Borneo, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, and Mount Roraima in Venezuela. Their adventures have also included gorilla-tracking in Zaire and camping their way across the Namibian desert. They live in London, England.</p><p> William Dampier is important today for many of the same reasons that made him fascinating to his 17th- century contemporaries. He was a representative man of his time: master navigator and peerless recorder of winds, currents, coastlines, seasonal weather and even magnetic fluctuation in England's great age of exploration. As another biographer of Dampier, W. Clark Russell, remarked, "No skillfuller body of seamen were ever afloat." Although more mariners of his time than might be expected left journals, maps and other writings, Dampier was but one example of the breed, and hundreds of other men lived out similar stories.</p><p> The men who became sailors were younger brothers like Dampier -- or poor, reckless characters greedy for wealth, experience and adventure. Dampier knew some Latin. Perhaps his parents did what they could to prepare him for the clergy or the law, but, orphaned at 16, he was instead apprenticed to a shipmaster. His first trips, which this biography by Diana and Michael Preston omits, along with almost all of his early life, were standard experiences: commercial voyages and then a stint in the navy in the Third Dutch War. Dampier's rambling, opportunistic travels, which had him jumping from ship to ship, experiencing sudden destination changes and enduring deprivation, were all common. After serving in the merchant marine and the navy, he became by turns coastal trader, privateer and outright pirate, and he rose to the leadership of two financed expeditions, one by Bristol speculators.</p><p>In his sealed bamboo carriers, Dampier preserved botanical and zoological notes, as was expected of a man in his position. As early as the 1660s, the Royal Society asked mariners to do exactly what Dampier did. Books before his, such as Robert Knox's An Historical Relation of Ceylon (1681), organized their chapters according to the Society's categories of knowledge. In contributing to the evolution of lists of what was to be collected, Dampier helped shape his own, Edmund Halley's and others' scientific expeditions.</p><p>There are two problems with this biography. First, it is not well written. Dampier's sea life can be divided neatly by his major voyages, but A Pirate of Exquisite Mind is imbalanced toward his first. The prose is often turgid and far too dependent on A New Voyage Around the World, Dampier's first and least impressive book. His slogs on foot through Central America seem endless and pointless. We are not told that buccaneers were usually trying to establish dependable trading contacts and routes or even settlements in parts of the world beyond the laws of any nation. Dampier's ambitions largely conformed to this economic model, as we see, for example, in his attempts to set up as a logwood trader. He and other privateers were also patriots, disrupting the shipping lines of England's enemies, attempting to intercept shipments of gold that paid for war.</p><p>The authors are better at narrating his expedition to Australia and make telling points about the contrasts between the culture of buccaneers, with the rules that had evolved to govern independent men on long voyages in close quarters, and that of the Royal Navy. It is not until the authors introduce another privateer, Woodes Rogers, into the narrative and compare him in some detail to Dampier that they establish a smooth, authoritative voice. Even so, they squash this voyage into 14 pages, although it was Dampier's third around the world and took three years.</p><p>The second problem is the portrait of Dampier. The Prestons desperately want him to be first and singular. They repeat "first to . . . ," sometimes correctly, but more often not. For example, they want Dampier to be the first European to reach Australia, but their muddled prose suggests that they are straining to obscure the Dutch explorer Janszoon Tasmen. Almost all of their claims about Dampier as a writer are inaccurate. Voyage literature was enormously popular before he wrote -- he joined the second great outpouring. Books such as Knox's, a reprint of Drake's voyages and Alexander Exquemelin's fascinating Buccaneers of America, which Dampier mentions, may have inspired his accounts, as he surely encountered them all when he arrived in London in 1691. Dampier's dedication to A New Voyage claimed he had "a hearty Zeal for the promotion of useful knowledge" (the motto of the Royal Society). As a privateer, he devoted that zeal to his "Country's advantage." </p><p>In the Prestons' hands, however, Dampier emerges as irascible and driven by a hunger for gold. In reality, he was a premier example of his time's embrace of empirical methods and desire to explore the entire globe. He explained one of his changes of ships by noting, "It was not from any dislike to my old Captain but to get some knowledge of the Northern Parts of this Continent of Mexico." The authors also leave out other major aspects of his personality, which are apparent in his four autobiographical books. His religion, for instance, is gone, as is the fascination with forms of government that he shared with his contemporaries (including Knox and Exquemelin) in the time when Englishmen remembered a civil war and a republic, and then saw a hereditary monarch displaced by a foreigner. The authors lose sight of his lively sense of humor, the detail that his interest in zoology seems to have been largely culinary and his ability to make himself unnoticeable when that was appropriate. Yet he could not have survived to age 63 had he not been a master of managing intricate situations and avoiding confrontations. The authors' inattention is especially frustrating since, in nearly every respect, Dampier is that best of biographical subjects -- the representative but exceptional person, one who reveals the indomitable spirit and amazing knowledge of the hundreds of men who lived out the same stories but did not find a publisher. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Paula R.

In elegant and witty prose, Andr� Aciman introduces us to the marvelous eccentrics who shaped his life--Uncle Vili, the strutting daredevil, soldier, salesman, and spy; the two grandmothers, the Princess and the Saint, who gossip in six languages; Aunt Flora, the German refugee who warns that Jews lose everything "at least twice in their lives." And through it all, we come to know a boy who, even as he longs for a wider world, does not want to be led, forever, out of Egypt.</p></p><p><p><b>Andr� Aciman</b> is the author of <i>False Papers </i>and<i> Call Me by Your Name</i>. He teaches comparative literature at the City University of New York Graduate Center and lives in Manhattan with his family.</p>Aciman (French Literature/Princeton) delivers a clear- eyed eulogy of a lost past and a family in decline. Aciman's Jewish-Turkish-Italian family came to Alexandria, Egypt, in 1905, long before young Andr&#x201a; was born. There they lived in highly leveraged splendor as Aciman's great-aunts and -uncles--particularly Great-uncle Vili, the flamboyant youngest brother--made and lost fortunes, despised the Arab natives, and survived two world wars. The family rose to, and fell from, the heights of government and European-Egyptian society, and by the late 1960s the entire clan had either died, emigrated, or been expelled from their adoptive home. Aciman begins his memoir in the recent past, with a visit to Great-uncle Vili, the first of the family to emigrate. The octogenarian had achieved his goal of becoming a genteel--and gentile-- Englishman: Because of his service to the British during WW II--all the while remaining faithful to Italian Fascism--he was granted a country estate in Surrey, where he lived out his life as Dr. H.M. Spingarn. Vili's sister Esther, Aciman's grandmother and one of the last to leave Egypt, was a mazmazelle, a European grande dame who dined at Alexandria's Sporting Club, fingered produce in the market, and bargained mercilessly with the local merchants. She also smuggled money out of Egypt for years before she was expelled along with her sister Elsa and Aciman and his parents. Aciman creates a romantic portrait of a bygone time without idealizing his colorful ancestors. Much of their interest is, in fact, in their pettiness, spitefulness, and bigotry. They were simultaneously assimilated, anti-Semitic, and practicing Jews; masters of their Egyptian servants and ``Dogs of the Arabs.'' Aciman's father was an unrepentant philanderer, his deaf mother a source of shame. He himself appears mainly as observer of the group's deterioration. A skillful portrayal of an extraordinary clan. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Armed solely with the equipment they could carry on their backs, shockingly scant intelligence, and their mastery of guerrilla warfare, Captain Jason Amerine and his ten men had no choice but to trust their only ally, a little-known Pashtun statesman named Hamid Karzai. Having returned from exile, Karzai�on the run from the Taliban�was traveling the countryside to raise a militia. </p> <p> <i>The Only Thing Worth Dying For</i> chronicles the most important mission in the early days of the Global War on Terror, when the men on the ground knew little about the enemy�and their commanders in Washington knew even less.

Dino Bacchetti, his former NYPD partner, sat having dinner.</p><p>&#x201c;Where the hell have you been?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Spokane, Washington,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;I told you, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember anything anymore,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Genevieve&#x2019;s job, now.&#x201d; Genevieve James was his new girlfriend, his first regular since his divorce. &#x201c;What were you doing in Spokane?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having the engine ripped off my airplane and replaced with a turbine&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a jet engine, turning a propeller.&#x201d;</p><p>A waiter set a Knob Creek on the rocks before him, and he sipped it gratefully.</p><p>&#x201c;But why are you late? Dinner was two hours ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because my flight was late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t take the airlines; you have an airplane.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dino, having sex again is addling your brain. I left the airplane in Spokane; the work takes three months. It&#x2019;s a big job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone put several letters on the table and began opening them.</p><p>&#x201c;You getting your mail here now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I stopped to drop off my bag, and I just grabbed the mail on the way out the door.&#x201d;</p><p>Elaine came over, allowed him to kiss her and sat down. &#x201c;You getting your mail here? We charge extra for that.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone put down the mail. &#x201c;No, I brought it with me. Any charge for opening it here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make a habit of it,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;People will think you&#x2019;re living in my back room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have a back room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t stop them from thinking it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your logic is unassailable,&#x201d; Stone said, shoving the mail aside and sipping his drink.</p><p>A waiter appeared with a menu.</p><p>&#x201c;Green bean salad, hold the peppers, spaghetti carbonara, half a bottle of the Chianti Classico,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;You look hungry,&#x201d; Elaine said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re late, too; where you been?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Spokane, Washington; Dino will explain it to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s turning his airplane into a jet,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;A jet with a propeller. It&#x2019;s called a turboprop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you doing this to your airplane?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Faster, quieter, more reliable, climbs faster.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>Elaine had never evinced the slightest interest in his airplane, Stone remembered. He waited for the next, inevitable question.</p><p>&#x201c;Only one engine?&#x201d; Elaine asked.</p><p>&#x201c;One&#x2019;s all you need.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What if it stops?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Extremely unlikely, but I&#x2019;d find a place to land it.&#x201d;</p><p>Elaine nodded. &#x201c;Yeah, sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is Genevieve?&#x201d; Stone asked Dino.</p><p>&#x201c;Late shift; she&#x2019;ll show soon. She might bring Eliza.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; Eliza Larkin was an ER doctor Stone had been seeing occasionally since he had been run down by a car and she had treated him.</p><p>The two women, on cue, breezed into the place, exchanged kisses with everybody and sat down.</p><p>&#x201c;Bring &#x2019;em a menu,&#x201d; Elaine said to a waiter.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks, I had dinner in the cafeteria earlier,&#x201d; Eliza said.</p><p>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Genevieve said.</p><p>Elaine looked at them incredulously. &#x201c;You ate food from a hospital cafeteria instead of here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would have fainted if I hadn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Eliza said. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll have dessert.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dessert is good,&#x201d; Elaine said, pointing at a tray of samples and motioning for a waiter to bring it over.</p><p>&#x201c;Cheesecake,&#x201d; Eliza said.</p><p>&#x201c;Make it two,&#x201d; Genevieve echoed.</p><p>The two women excused themselves and went to the ladies&#x2019; room.</p><p>Stone turned his attention to the mail again, and a large white envelope caught his attention. He turned it over to read the return address. The White House, Washington, D.C., it read.</p><p>Stone opened the envelope.</p><p>&#x201c;You look funny,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been invited to dinner at the White House,&#x201d; Stone said, gulping. &#x201c;Holly Barker and me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On the same invitation?&#x201d; Elaine asked, taking it from him.</p><p>&#x201c;Why you and Holly?&#x201d; Dino asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, Eliza is gonna want to know the answer to that question, too,&#x201d; Elaine said.</p><p>Stone took the invitation and stuffed it into his pocket. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not discuss it with her,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;especially since I don&#x2019;t know the answer to that question.&#x201d;</p><p>His cellphone vibrated on his belt, and he flipped it open. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Holly.&#x201d; Holly Barker was his friend and sometime lover, a retired army officer and chief of police in a Florida town, now doing something or other for the CIA.</p><p>&#x201c;Speak of the devil.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How was Spokane?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine. How did you know I was in Spokane?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a computer program that tracks the flight of any airplane. You went yesterday; I figured you came back today. You&#x2019;re doing the engine conversion?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How the hell did you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know lots of stuff. You got the invitation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You getting your mail at Elaine&#x2019;s these days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I picked it up on the way here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have further instructions for you about the dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to take five days, maybe a week of your time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to me carefully, and don&#x2019;t argue. Dinner, you will have noticed, is tomorrow night; it&#x2019;s black tie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got that from the invitation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pack a bag with warm-weather clothing and bring your passport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Holly...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up. I told you not to ask questions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to see what&#x2019;s on my calendar for the next week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing; I checked with Joan this afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>Joan Robertson was his secretary. &#x201c;A conspiracy,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know the half of it, kiddo,&#x201d; she replied, then hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Elaine asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;Weird, is what.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>The following day, Stone, as per directions included with his White House invitation, took the Acela to Washington and a cab to the Willard, the restored grande dame hotel of the mid-nineteenth century. He was led by a bellman to an elegant suite and was a little surprised to find the luggage and clothes of a woman there. He tipped the bellman, then explored.</p><p>The clothes in the closet were few, but from fashionable designers, and slinky. He reflected that Holly was tall, but not particularly slender, and a little on the butch side, with short, light brown hair. She was certainly very attractive, but these clothes could not be hers. He called the front desk to inquire as to whether he was in the right suite and was assured that he was. He looked at his watch: four hours until he was to present himself at the White House.</p><p>He phoned the concierge and arranged for a massage, and while he waited for the masseuse to appear, he sent his dinner jacket and other clothes out to be pressed.</p><p>After an hour and a half of prodding and pummeling, he soaked in a hot tub and took a nap. He was in front of the hotel at the appointed time and was met by a black Lincoln and a driver, who knew the way to the White House.</p><p>The mansion and its grounds looked very beautiful with the moonlight on its six-inch blanket of new snow. At the gate he identified himself with his invitation and his passport and was driven to a portico, lit by a huge, hanging lamp, with Marine guards on either side of the door. Inside, he was greeted by name (they must have a photograph, he thought), his coat was taken, and he was asked to follow an usher. They walked down a portrait-hung hallway, took a couple of turns and stopped before a pair of double doors. The usher rapped lightly, and the door was opened by a man in a tuxedo. &#x201c;Mr. Barrington,&#x201d; the usher said, and stepped back to allow Stone to enter.</p><p>Stone walked into the room and was astonished to find himself in the Oval Office. The president of the United States, William Henry Lee IV, sat at the desk, on the phone, in his shirtsleeves, his dinner jacket resting on a valet stand beside his chair.</p><p>The president waved and pointed at a couch.</p><p>Stone sat down, and it was a good thing, too, because he felt a little weak in the knees. He had never been in this room, nor in this house, nor had he ever seen its occupant face-to-face.</p><p>A uniformed butler materialized and asked his pleasure in drink.</p><p>&#x201c;A Knob Creek on the rocks,&#x201d; Stone said automatically. &#x201c;But if you don&#x2019;t have that...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have it, sir,&#x201d; the man said, and he was back in a trice, with not one, but two drinks on a tray. He served Stone, then set the other glass on the president&#x2019;s desk and dematerialized.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll expect to hear from you before noon tomorrow,&#x201d; the president said, then hung up. &#x201c;Mr. Barrington,&#x201d; he said, rising and slipping into his dinner jacket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard a great deal about you.&#x201d; He walked toward Stone, his hand out.</p><p>Stone rose and shook his hand. &#x201c;Have you, Mr. President?&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t imagine how.</p><p>&#x201c;Bill Eggers is an old friend, and Woodman &amp; Weld have been very helpful to the Democratic Party and to me over the years.&#x201d; His accent was softly Southern. &#x201c;Bill has told me some of the things you&#x2019;ve done for them since becoming of counsel to the firm.&#x201d;</p><p>What Stone did for Woodman &amp; Weld was the things the firm did not want to be seen to be doing themselves, and he was a little embarrassed that the president knew about that. &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t be embarrassed, Stone,&#x201d; Lee said. &#x201c;Every law firm needs that sort of work&#x201d;&#x2014;he paused&#x2014;&#x201c;as does every administration.&#x201d; He waved Stone back to his seat.</p><p>Stone sat down, uncertain as to what might come next.</p><p>&#x201c;I asked you here a few minutes before the arrival of the others to thank you in advance for your help. I&#x2019;m aware of your campaign contributions over the years, and I&#x2019;m grateful for those, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone had made a few thousand-dollar donations, but he couldn&#x2019;t imagine why the president would be aware of that.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m also aware of your honorable and very capable service to the NYPD for the fourteen years before you became an attorney, and as a citizen, I thank you for that, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mr. President.&#x201d; Stone gulped. He took a long sip from his bourbon.</p><p>&#x201c;Good stuff, Knob Creek,&#x201d; the president said. &#x201c;Knob Creek was where Abraham Lincoln spent his early years, in Kentucky, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>The president raised his glass. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the patriotic thing to do,&#x201d; he said, taking a sip. &#x201c;Though I mustn&#x2019;t be patriotic too often these days, given the nature of the work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose not, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>The president sat down on the sofa beside him. &#x201c;Let me come directly to the point; the others will be here soon.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone waited and listened.</p><p>&#x201c;I believe that, some years ago, you were involved in a widely publicized criminal trial, on the island of St. Marks, way south of here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, I was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe I even caught a glimpse of you on 60 Minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, it was important to the outcome of the trial that we obtain as much media coverage as possible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I forget; what was the outcome of the trial?&#x201d; The president asked, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>Stone had the distinct feeling that he had forgotten nothing. &#x201c;My client was hanged,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>President Lee burst out laughing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware that you believed her to be hanged, until some years later, and I&#x2019;m aware of your most recent encounter with her. Where is she now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a Florida prison, Mr. President.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, yes, and she&#x2019;s been asking me for a pardon every year since; for her husband, too. Tell me, Stone, if you were in my position, would you pardon them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since I don&#x2019;t represent her anymore, I can say candidly, absolutely not. Both she and her husband deserve worse than being where they presently are, and the country is better off for having them there.&#x201d;</p><p>The president chuckled. &#x201c;We are of one mind,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Stone, someone is going to ask you to go back to St. Marks for...a visit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would not be unpleasant duty, Mr. President. It&#x2019;s a beautiful island.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you can take the time to go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was requested to pack my bags, Mr. President, and I have done so. May I ask why you want me to go back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I haven&#x2019;t asked you to go back,&#x201d; the president said. &#x201c;Someone else will, but I will not. And I must ask you to recall this meeting, this room, this bourbon and this conversation as wholly imaginary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As you wish, Mr. President.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stone, I&#x2019;m sure you know that I am up for reelection in the autumn, and I wanted to tell you personally that your visit to St. Marks may, in one way or another, have a profound effect on my chances. Since, in light of your campaign contributions in the past, I have some reason to believe you think it might be important for me to finish my administration&#x2019;s work, I wanted to tell you personally that you may soon be in a position to contribute to my campaign in a larger way than you imagine, and I want you to know, in advance, that you have my deep gratitude for your help.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone was too baffled to speak, and he was relieved of that obligation when a door behind him opened and a woman&#x2019;s voice said, &#x201c;Will, honey, it&#x2019;s time for us to go in.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sprang to his feet and turned to see the first lady, who was also the Director of Central Intelligence, standing in the open door.</p><p>&#x201c;Kate, darling, this is Mr....&#x201d; the president started to say.</p><p>&#x201c;I know who he is, Will,&#x201d; she replied, walking over and shaking his hand. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m glad to have the opportunity to thank you for your efforts in solving the death of your cousin, Dick Stone, last summer. Dick was about to assume an important post at the Agency, and I had hopes that he might one day succeed me, when I&#x2019;ve played out my string. Lance Cabot has told me how helpful you were to him during the investigation.&#x201d;</p><p>Funny, Stone thought, and I was laboring under the apparent illusion that Lance was helping me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very welcome, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck on St. Marks, Mr. Barrington.&#x201d; She turned and walked out the way she had come in.</p><p>&#x201c;I must go,&#x201d; Will Lee said, shaking Stone&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;And by the way, the woman you just met was entirely imaginary, too. Have a seat; someone will come for you.&#x201d;</p><p>The president followed his wife out the door, closing it behind him.</p><p>Stone stood in the center of the Oval Office, alone with its ghosts. He recognized the President&#x2019;s desk as the one John Kennedy had used, and he remembered a photograph of John-John playing under it.

Join 150+ makers as they share the stories behind their beautiful and bold work and use this book to do some tinkering yourself. We do mean &#x201c;use this book&#x201d; in a literal sense... you won&#x2019;t even be able to reach the first page before using it.<br><br><i>The Art of Tinkering </i> is a collection of exhibits, artwork, and projects that celebrate a whole new way to learn, in which people create their own knowledge through making and doing, working with readily available materials, getting their hands dirty, collaborating with others, problem-solving in the most fun sense of the word, and, yes, oftentimes failing and bouncing back from getting stuck.<br><br> Each artist featured in <i> The Art of Tinkering </i> goes through this process, and lovingly shares the backstory behind their own work so that readers can feel invited to join in on the whimsy. Whether it&#x2019;s sharing their favorite tools (who knew toenail clippers could be so handy?) or offering a glimpse of their workspaces (you&#x2019;d be amazed how many electronics tools you can pack into one pantry!), the stories, lessons, and tips in <i>The Art of Tinkering </i> offer a fascinating portrait of today&#x2019;s maker scene.<br> <br>Artists include:<br> Learn from greats like Scott Weaver, Arthur Ganson, Moxie, Tim Hunkin, AnnMarie Thomas, Ranjit Bhatnajar and Jie Qi.</p><p>As codirectors of the Tinkering Studio, Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich see their roles at the Exploratorium as advocates for making as a way of knowing. They believe deeply in studio pedagogy and the ability that we all have to think with our hands, and are curious about how people develop personal and unique understandings of the world for themselves. As undergraduates, both attended the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, where Mike studied fine arts, filmmaking, and photography and Karen focused on environmental design. <br> <br> Before coming to the Exploratorium, they pursued graduate studies in education and technology at Harvard and MIT. Today, after more than twenty years working as a team to integrate science, art, and technology into curriculum for both in-school and out-of-school learning environments, they foster and facilitate informal learning spaces for making and tinkering, offering people a chance to connect to their own learning in a deeply personal way. They&#x2019;ve worked with audiences as diverse as museum visitors, primary school students, Tibetan monks, prison inmates, and graduate school researchers, and are both happy to call the Tinkering Studio home, where they are able to work with a delightfully quirky group of artists, educators, and innovators. <br> <br> The Exploratorium&#x2014;San Francisco&#x2019;s renowned museum of science, art, and human perception&#x2014;is dedicated to changing the way the world learns. Within the Exploratorium, the Tinkering Studio is a workshop in which science and technology become powerful tools for personal expression, and where visitors gather to participate in hands-on, mind-expanding activities and demonstrations."The book showcases 150+ makers working at the intersection of art, science and technology and captures that infectious maker spirit I so deeply love. Inside you'll not only find profiles of important makers but also how you can start tinkering around and explore making things from soft circuits, wire art, puppets, mark-making machines, fused fashion and more.", <i>Coquette</i><br><br>"If you know someone who loves making or Maker Faire or the Exploratorium or just the delightful little moments of everyday life, make sure this book makes it into their hands.

But Polly, with her stunning good looks and impeccable connections, is bored by the monotony of her glittering debut season in London. Having just come from India, where her father served as Viceroy, she claims to have hoped that society in a colder climate would be less obsessed with love affairs. The apparently aloof and indifferent Polly has a long-held secret, however, one that leads to the shattering of her mother&#x2019;s dreams and her own disinheritance. When an elderly duke begins pursuing the disgraced Polly and a callow potential heir curries favor with her parents, nothing goes as expected, but in the end all find happiness in their own unconventional ways.&nbsp;<br><br>Featuring an introduction by Flora Fraser.</p><p>Nancy Mitford, daughter of Lord and Lady Redesdale and the eldest of the six legendary Mitford sisters, was born in 1904 and educated at home on the family estate in Oxfordshire. She made her debut in London and soon became one of the bright young things of the 1920s, a close friend of Henry Green, Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman, and their circle. A beauty and a wit, she began writing for magazines and writing novels while she was still in her twenties. In all, she wrote eight novels as well as biographies of Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire, Louis XIV, and Frederick the Great. She died in 1973. More information can be found at www.nancymitford.com.Chapter 1<br> <br> I am obliged to begin this story with a brief account of the Hampton family, because it is necessary to emphasise the fact once and for all that the Hamptons were very grand as well as very rich. A short session with Burke or with Debrett would be quite enough to make this clear, but these large volumes are not always available, while the books on the subject by Lord Montdore&#x2019;s brother-in-law, Boy Dougdale, are all out of print. His great talent for snobbishness and small talent for literature have produced three detailed studies of his wife&#x2019;s forebears, but they can only be read now by asking a bookseller to get them at second hand. (The bookseller will put an advertisement in his trade paper, <i>The Clique</i>: &#x201c;H. Dougdale, any by.&#x201d; He will be snowed under with copies at about a shilling each and will then proudly inform his customer that he has &#x201c;managed to find what you want,&#x201d; implying hours of careful search on barrows, dirt cheap, at 30/- the three.) <i>Georgiana Lady Montdore and Her Circle</i>, <i>The Magnificent Montdores</i> and <i>Old Chronicles of Hampton</i>, I have them beside me as I write, and see that the opening paragraph of the first is: <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Two ladies, one dark, one fair, both young and lovely, were driving briskly towards the little village of Kensington on a fine May<b> </b>morning. They were Georgiana, Countess of Montdore and her great friend Walburga, Duchess of Paddington, and they made a delightfully animated picture as they discussed the burning question of the hour&#x2014;should one or should one not subscribe to a parting present for poor dear Princess Lieven?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> This book is dedicated, by gracious permission, to Her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess Peter of Russia, and has eight full-page illustrations. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It must be said that when this trilogy first came out it had quite a vogue with the lending-library public. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The family of Hampton is ancient in the West of England, indeed Fuller, in his <i>Worthies </i>mentions it as being of stupendous antiquity.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Burke makes it out just a shade more ancient than does Debrett, but both plunge back into the mists of mediaeval times from which they drag forth ancestors with P. G. Wodehouse names, Ugs and Berts and Threds, and Walter Scott fates. &#x201c;His Lordship was attainted&#x2014;beheaded&#x2014;convicted&#x2014;proscribed&#x2014;exiled&#x2014;dragged from prison by a furious mob&#x2014;slain at the Battle of Cr�cy&#x2014;went down in the White Ship&#x2014;perished during the third crusade&#x2014;killed in a duel.&#x201d; There were very few natural deaths to record in the early misty days. Both Burke and Debrett linger with obvious enjoyment over so genuine an object as this family, unspoilt by the ambiguities of female line and deed poll. Nor could any of those horrid books, which came out in the nineteenth century, devoted to research and aiming to denigrate the nobility, make the object seem less genuine. Tall, golden-haired barons, born in wedlock and all looking very much alike, succeeded each other at Hampton, on lands which had never been bought or sold, generation after generation until, in 1770, the Lord Hampton of the day brought back, from a visit to Versailles, a French bride, a Mademoiselle de Montdore. Their son had brown eyes, a dark skin and presumably, for it is powdered in all the pictures of him, black hair. This blackness did not persist in the family. He married a golden-haired heiress from Derbyshire, and the Hamptons reverted to their blue-and-gold looks, for which they are famous to this day. The son of the Frenchwoman was rather clever and very worldly; he dabbled in politics and wrote a book of aphorisms, but his chief claim to fame was his great and lifelong friendship with the Regent, which procured him, among other favours, an earldom. His mother&#x2019;s family having all perished during the Terror in France, he took her name as his title. Enormously rich, he spent enormously; he had a taste for French objects of art and acquired, during the years which followed the Revolution, a splendid collection of such things, including many pieces from the royal establishments, and others which had been looted out of the Hotel de Montdore in the rue de Varenne. To make a suitable setting for this collection, he then proceeded to pull down at Hampton the large plain house that Adam had built for his grandfather and to drag over to England stone by stone (as modern American millionaires are supposed to do) a Gothic French chateau. This he assembled round a splendid tower of his own designing, covered the walls of the rooms with French panelling and silks and set it in a formal landscape which he also designed and planted himself. It was all very grand and very mad, and in the between wars period of which I write, very much out of fashion. &#x201c;I suppose it is beautiful,&#x201d; people used to say, &#x201c;but frankly I don&#x2019;t admire it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> This Lord Montdore also built Montdore House in Park Lane and a castle on a crag in Aberdeenshire. He was really much the most interesting and original character the family produced, but no member of it deviated from a tradition of authority. A solid, worthy, powerful Hampton can be found on every page of English history, his influence enormous in the West of England and his counsels not unheeded in London.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tradition was carried on by the father of my friend, Polly Hampton. If an Englishman could be descended from the gods it would be he, so much the very type of English nobleman that those who believed in aristocratic government would always begin by pointing to him as a justification of their argument. It was generally felt, indeed, that if there were more people like him the country would not be in its present mess, even Socialists conceding his excellence, which they could afford to do since there was only one of him and he was getting on. A scholar, a Christian, a gentleman, finest shot in the British Isles, best-looking Viceroy we ever sent to India, a popular landlord, a pillar of the Conservative Party, a wonderful old man, in short, who nothing common ever did or mean. My cousin Linda and I, two irreverent little girls whose opinion makes no odds, used to think that he was a wonderful old fraud, and it seemed to us that in that house it was Lady Montdore who really counted. Now Lady Montdore was forever doing common things and mean, and she was intensely unpopular, quite as much disliked as her husband was loved, so that anything he might do that was considered not quite worthy of him, or which did not quite fit in with his reputation, was immediately laid at her door. &#x201c;Of course she made him do it.&#x201d; On the other hand, I have often wondered whether without her to bully him and push him forward and plot and intrigue for him and &#x201c;make him do it,&#x201d; whether, in fact, without the help of those very attributes which caused her to be so much disliked, her thick skin and ambition and boundless driving energy, he would ever have done anything at all noteworthy in the world.</p><h2>The Faith Club: A Muslim, A Christian, A Jew-- Three Women Search for Understanding (English, Arabic and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>A groundbreaking book about Americans searching for faith and mutual respect, The Faith Club weaves the story of three women, their three religions, and their urgent quest to understand one another.<br><br>When an American Muslim woman befriends two other mothers, one Jewish and one Christian, they decide to educate their children about their respective religions. None of them guessed their regular meetings would provide life-changing answers and form bonds that would forever alter their struggles with prejudice, fear, and anger. Personal, powerful, and compelling, The Faith Club forces readers to face the tough questions about their own religions.<br> <br> Pioneering, timely, deeply thoughtful, and full of hope, The Faith Club&#x2019;s caring message will resonate with people of all faiths.</p><p><b>Ranya Idliby</b> was raised in Dubai and McLean, Virginia. She holds a bachelor of science from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and earned her MS in international relations from the London School of Economics. She lives in New York City with her husband and two children.*Starred Review* Ranya Idliby is a Palestinian Muslim; Suzanne Oliver, an ex--Catholic now in the Episcopal Church; and Priscilla Warner, Jewish. Initially, the idea behind establishing a faith club was simple--the three women would collaborate on an interfaith children's book emphasizing the connections among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam that would reinforce the common heritage the three religions share. In post-9/11 America, however, real life began getting in the way. Almost from the start, differences that culminated in conflict emerged; at one point, the tension even jeopardized the project altogether. Prophetically, while searching for a story to help illustrate connections among the religions, Suzanne chose the Crucifixion, which immediately set off alarm bells for Priscilla. Yet they persevered. All three agreed that to work together they had to be brutally candid, "no matter how rude or politically incorrect." Eventually--and as they make abundantly clear, not easily--conflict and anger gave way to a special kind of rapprochement that merged mutual understanding and respect. Each woman brings to the table her prejudices, unique faith stories, and personal stereotypes and misconceptions (Priscilla, for example, had those of one who had never before met a Palestinian woman). Brimming with passion and conviction, and concluding with suggestions for starting a similar faith club, this is essential reading for anyone interested in interfaith dialogue. <i>June Sawyers</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In <i>The Pastor in a Secular Age</i>, Root explores how this secular age has impacted the identity and practice of the pastor, obscuring his or her core vocation: to call and assist others into the experience of ministry.<br><br>Using examples of pastors throughout history--from Augustine and Jonathan Edwards to Martin Luther King&nbsp;Jr. and Nadia Bolz-Weber--Root shows how pastors have both perpetuated and responded to our secular age. Root turns to Old Testament texts and to the theology of Robert Jenson to explain how pastors can regain the important role of attending to people's experiences of divine action, offering a new vision for pastoral ministry today.</p><p><b>"A timely and significant resource" <br></b><br>"We are embedded in and pervaded by what Charles Taylor called a 'secular age.'

Better books help you see the work of God despite the millennia of obstacles we have thrown up against divine agency. Root thinks the living God can break through our pastoral malaise.

It has also torn at the lives of those on the outside. As arrest quotas and high tech surveillance criminalize entire blocks, a climate of fear and suspicion pervades daily life, not only for young men entangled in the legal system, but for their family members and working neighbors.</p><p> Alice Goffman spent six years in one Philadelphia neighborhood, documenting the routine stops, searches, raids, and beatings that young men navigate as they come of age. In the course of her research, she became roommates with Mike and Chuck, two friends trying to make ends meet between low wage jobs and the drug trade. Like many in the neighborhood, Mike and Chuck were caught up in a cycle of court cases, probation sentences, and low level warrants, with no clear way out. We observe their girlfriends and mothers enduring raids and interrogations, "clean" residents struggling to go to school and work every day as the cops chase down neighbors in the streets, and others eking out a living by providing clean urine, fake documents, and off the books medical care. </p><p>This fugitive world is the hidden counterpoint to mass incarceration, the grim underside of our nation's social experiment in punishing Black men and their families.

You have changed because of her. We are intrigued by the humans who have gathered around your Courtyard, so we will give you some time to decide how much human the terra indigene will keep.</i></p><p>Simon Wolfgard, leader of the Lakeside Courtyard, stared at his bedroom ceiling, the words of warning, of threat, chasing away sleep, as they had for the past few nights.</p><p>The words weren&#x2019;t the only thing chasing away sleep. Procrastination was a human trait, and in this past week, he&#x2019;d discovered that it had its own kind of bite. Wolves didn&#x2019;t procrastinate. When the pack needed food, they went hunting. They didn&#x2019;t make excuses or find some unimportant thing that didn&#x2019;t need doing at that very minute. They got on with the business of taking care of the things that in turn took care of them.</p><p>I wanted Meg to heal from the cut she made last week. I wanted to give her time before asking her to carry some of the weight of these decisions. She&#x2019;s the Trailblazer who is finding ways for other cassandra sangue to survive. She didn&#x2019;t make decisions for herself or anyone else for twenty-four years, and now she&#x2019;s supposed to make all these important decisions that could mean life or death for . . . who? The other blood prophets? All the humans living in Thaisia?</p><p>Growling, as if that would scare his thoughts into hiding, Simon rolled over, closed his eyes, and pushed his face into his pillow, determined to get a little more sleep. But the thoughts were excellent hunters and devoured sleep.</p><p>We will give you some time to decide how much human the terra indigene will keep.</p><p>For the past week, he&#x2019;d made excuses to himself and the rest of the Courtyard&#x2019;s Business Association, and they had let him make those excuses because none of them&#x2014;not Vlad or Henry or Tess&#x2014;wanted to tell Meg what was truly at stake now. But time, like Meg&#x2019;s strange, fragile skin, was not something he could afford to waste.</p><p>Rolling the other way, Simon stared at the window. As he raised his head, his ears shifted to Wolf shape, pricking to better catch the sounds outside.</p><p>Sparrows. Those first sleepy chirps that announced the dawn when the sky began its change from black to gray.</p><p>Morning.</p><p>Pushing aside the tangled sheet, Simon hustled into the bathroom to pee. As he washed his hands, he glanced over his shoulder. Did he need to shower? He bent his head and gave himself a sniff. He smelled like a healthy Wolf. So he would shower later when he&#x2019;d have to deal with more than the one human who was his special friend. Besides, she wouldn&#x2019;t be taking a shower either.</p><p>He took a step away from the sink, then stopped. Skipping a shower was one thing, but the human mouth in the morning produced scents strong enough to discourage close contact.</p><p>Loading toothpaste onto his toothbrush, Simon studied his reflection while he cleaned his teeth. Dark hair that was getting shaggy&#x2014;he&#x2019;d need to do something about that before the Courtyard&#x2019;s guests arrived. Skin that had browned a bit from working outside without a shirt on. And the amber eyes of a Wolf. Human skin or Wolf form, the eyes didn&#x2019;t change.</p><p>He rinsed out his mouth and started to put the toothbrush back in the medicine chest above the sink. Then he looked at his reflection and lifted his lips to reveal his teeth.</p><p>No, the eyes didn&#x2019;t change when he shifted to Wolf, but . . .</p><p>Shifting his head to Wolf form, he loaded the toothbrush with toothpaste a second time and brushed the other, better, set of teeth. Then he growled because a Wolf&#x2019;s mouth wasn&#x2019;t designed to rinse and spit. He ended up leaning over the sink and pouring cups of water over his teeth and tongue so no one would think he was foaming at the mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Next time I&#x2019;m just chewing a twig as usual,&#x201d; he grumbled when he shifted back to fully human.</p><p>Returning to the bedroom, he pulled on jeans and a T-shirt. Then he stepped to the window and put his face close to the screen. Cool enough outside for socks and sneakers&#x2014;and a sweatshirt since they would be walking at Meg&#x2019;s speed, not his.</p><p>He finished dressing, then grabbed his keys out of the dish on his dresser and went out the door in his apartment that opened onto the back hallway he shared with Meg. He unlocked her kitchen door and opened it carefully. Sometimes she used the slide lock as extra security, and breaking her door by accident would just cause trouble.</p><p>He&#x2019;d caused enough trouble the time he&#x2019;d broken the door on purpose.</p><p>No slide lock. Good.</p><p>Simon slipped into Meg&#x2019;s kitchen and quietly closed the door. Then he headed for her bedroom.</p><p>A light breeze coming through the partially opened window played with the summer curtains the female pack&#x2014;Meg&#x2019;s human friends&#x2014;had helped her purchase and hang. The morning light also came through the window, giving him a clear look at the woman curled up under the covers.</p><p>Was she cold? If he&#x2019;d stayed with her last night, she wouldn&#x2019;t be cold.</p><p>&#x201c;Meg?&#x201d; Cautious, because she could kick like a moose when she was scared, he gave her shoulder a little push. &#x201c;Time to wake up, Meg.&#x201d;</p><p>She grunted and burrowed under the covers until only the top of her head showed.</p><p>Wrong response.</p><p>Holding out one hand to block a potential kick, Simon laid the other hand on her hip and bounced her against the mattress a couple of times.</p><p>&#x201c;What? What?&#x201d; Meg struggled to sit up, so he obligingly grabbed her arm and pulled.</p><p>&#x201c;Time to wake up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Simon?&#x201d; She turned her head and blinked at the window. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s still dark.&#x201d; She flopped down on the bed and tried to pull up the covers.</p><p>He grabbed the covers, and the brief game of tug had her sitting upright again.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not dark; it&#x2019;s just early,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come on, Meg. We&#x2019;ll take a walk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not morning. The alarm clock didn&#x2019;t go off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need an alarm clock. You&#x2019;ve got sparrows, and they say it&#x2019;s morning.&#x201d;</p><p>When she didn&#x2019;t respond, Simon hauled her to her feet and steered her out the bedroom door and down the hallway to the bathroom.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you awake enough to pee and brush your teeth?&#x201d;</p><p>She closed the door in his face.</p><p>Taking that as a yes, Simon returned to Meg&#x2019;s bedroom and pulled out the clothes she would need. Most of the clothes. Apparently a male wasn&#x2019;t supposed to take a female&#x2019;s underclothes out of a drawer unless he was mated to that female. And males weren&#x2019;t supposed to see the underclothes unless females wanted the underclothes to be seen.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t understand why everyone fussed about taking clean clothes out of a drawer. Underclothes smelled a lot more interesting after the female wore them.</p><p>Probably not something human females wanted to know.</p><p>While he waited, he made up the bed, more to discourage Meg from falling back into it than because he wanted to tidy the room. Besides, running his hands over the sheets and breathing in her scent made him happy.</p><p>Why had he thought sleeping in his human form last night was a good idea, especially when it meant sleeping alone? If he had shifted to his Wolf form as he usually did, he could have stayed with Meg, could have curled up next to her in her bed.</p><p>All right, he hadn&#x2019;t thought staying in human form overnight was a good idea, just a necessary exercise. Six Wolves from the Addirondak packs were coming to the Lakeside Courtyard next week to experience interacting with humans in ways they couldn&#x2019;t in their own territory. Three were adults who were already dealing with the humans who lived in towns located in and around the Addirondak Mountains. The other three were juveniles who had completed their first year of the human-centric education that would train them to keep watch over the humans living in Thaisia.</p><p>Keeping watch to make sure humans kept to the agreements their ancestors had made with the terra indigene was dangerous work. The Others might refer to humans as clever meat&#x2014;and they were&#x2014;but they were also invading predators who grabbed territory whenever they could. And despite what their government officials said, humans weren&#x2019;t really concerned with the overall well-being of their kind. Humans belonging to the Humans First and Last movement had howled about a food shortage in Thaisia and said the terra indigene had caused it. But it was the HFL humans who had sold the surplus stores of food to the Cel-Romano Alliance of Nations for profit and then lied about it. Those lies had spurred a fight in Lakeside that resulted in the deaths of police officer Lawrence MacDonald and Crystal Crowgard. By doing those things, humans had drawn the attention of terra indigene who usually stayed away from human-controlled places while their intentions were benevolent.</p><p>Those earth natives, who lived deep in the wild country, had decided that the humans living in Thaisia had committed a breach of trust, and all agreements between humans and the Others might be rescinded. Probably would be rescinded. Already there were restrictions on what kind of cargo could be carried by ships traveling on the Great Lakes. There were restrictions on what kind of human could travel from one human city to another. The human governments that oversaw human concerns on a regional level were reeling from the sanctions. If ships couldn&#x2019;t carry food and merchandise from one region to another, if trains couldn&#x2019;t carry food and fuel to cities that needed both, what would happen to all the humans living on the continent?</p><p>If the humans who were supposed to be in charge had paid any attention to Thaisia&#x2019;s history, they would know what would happen to the humans. The invasive, two-legged predators would be eliminated, and the land would be reclaimed by the earth natives, the terra indigene, the Others.</p><p>But that wouldn&#x2019;t be as easy to do as it had been a few centuries ago. Then, there was little that the humans built or used that would harm the land if left to decay on its own. Now there were refineries that processed the crude oil being drawn out of the earth. Now there were places that stored fuel. Now there were industries that might damage the land if left untended. How much would be harmed if those things were destroyed or abandoned?</p><p>Simon had no answers, and the terra indigene who watched over the wild country&#x2014;the dangerous, primal beings who cloaked their true terra indigene nature in forms so old those shapes had no names&#x2014;would not be concerned with answers. Even if everything else disappeared from the world to make room for the new that would be born from destruction and change, they would still exist.</p><p>The terra indigene shifters like the Wolves and Bears, the Hawks and Crows, referred to those forms as the Elders, a benevolent-sounding word for the beings who were Namid&#x2019;s teeth and claws.</p><p>Meg returned from the bathroom, looking a little more awake and a lot less happy to see him. She was going to be more unhappy when she found out why he wanted to take this walk.</p><p>&#x201c;Get dressed, Meg. We need to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>She pointed at the bedroom door.</p><p>He was the leader of the Courtyard and she was an employee of the Courtyard, so she shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed to give him orders, even nonverbal ones. But he was learning that, when dealing with humans, pack order wasn&#x2019;t always maintained inside the den. Which meant Meg was dominant in her den and could disregard that he was dominant everywhere else.</p><p>He left the room and closed the door, then pressed his ear against the wood. Drawers opening, drawers closing. Movement.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop hovering, Simon.&#x201d;</p><p>She sounded annoyed instead of sleepy. Having sufficiently poked the porcupine, so to speak, he went back to her kitchen and checked out her cupboards and fridge to make sure she had enough people food. Half a quart of milk; a couple of bites of cheese&#x2014;maybe more in terms of human bites; a small bowl of strawberries&#x2014;her share of the berries she and Henry Beargard had picked yesterday; a wrapped half a sandwich from A Little Bite, the Courtyard&#x2019;s coffee shop.</p><p>Her cupboard had a canning jar of peaches, a jar of spaghetti sauce, and a box of spaghetti.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re poking around for leftover pizza, I ate it last night,&#x201d; Meg said, entering the kitchen.</p><p>Simon closed the cupboard. Was this a typical amount of food for humans to store in the warmer months? He didn&#x2019;t have more than this in his kitchen, but he usually chased down his meal and ate it fresh, so other foods were just supplements that he enjoyed for taste and were good for the human form.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you want something to eat?&#x201d; Meg asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Later.&#x201d; Leaving her kitchen, he went down the back stairs that led to the outer door, confident that she would follow him. Once outside, he took her hand, linking his fingers with hers, a form of contact and connection they&#x2019;d started a week ago after she&#x2019;d spoken prophecy about the River Road Community.</p><p>&#x201c;The grass is wet,&#x201d; Meg said. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we walk on the road?&#x201d;</p><p>Simon shook his head. This morning the road, which was wide enough for a vehicle and formed a circle inside the Courtyard, felt too human.</p><p>How to start? What to say?</p><p>They passed the expanded kitchen garden for the Green Complex, the only multispecies complex in the Courtyard. As a way to help the humans who were working for the Courtyard, the Others had agreed to let those humans share in the harvest if they did their share of the work. There was at least one human checking the garden every day, ma...</p></p><h2>The Ember Blade (The Darkwater Legacy)</h2><p><p>Empires rise, civilisations fall and one culture comes to subsume another.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Kindergarten-Grade 5 Heller, who celebrated collective nouns in A Cache of Jewels (Grossett, 1987) here gives similar treatment to verbs in singing verse with vibrant illustrations which fairly leap from the pages in double-page spreads. While verbs do not lend themselves easily to two-dimensional illustrations, and many of the concepts here are too advanced and abstract for the usual picture book age child, these illustrations and the design of the book have such appeal that even children to whom the words seem mostly gibberish will enjoy the rhythm and visual impact of the book. Older children will find it a painless and concise grammar lesson as well as a visual treat. Most of the verse flows smoothly, and the meanings are clear. Verbs illustrated are well chosen and not hackneyed. While the overall design of the book is outstanding, it is unfortunate (for library circulation) that the text continues on the endpapers. This book should be a boon to language arts teachers in the upper elementary grades as well as fun for all children and adults who love to play with language. Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

She was the author of the feminist classic <strong>The Second Sex</strong>, several volumes of autobiography, and highly acclaimed novels, including <strong>The Mandarins</strong>, winner of the Prix Goncourt.</p>Though it was still daylight, the hot lamp was shining full-beam over the mahjong table. Diamond rings flashed under its glare as their wearers clacked and reshuffled their tiles. The tablecloth, tied down over the table legs, stretched out into a sleek plain of blinding white. The harsh artificial light silhouetted to full advantage the generous curve of Chia-chih&#39;s bosom, and laid bare the elegant lines of her hexagonal face, its beauty somehow accentuated by the imperfectly narrow forehead, by the careless, framing wisps of hair. Her makeup was understated, except for the glossily rouged arcs of her lips. Her hair she had pinned nonchalantly back from her face, then allowed to hang down to her shoulders. Her sleeveless cheongsam of electric blue moire satin reached to the knees, its shallow, rounded collar standing only half an inch tall, in the Western style. A brooch fixed to the collar matched her diamond-studded sapphire button earrings.The two ladies--tai-tais--immediately to her left and right were both wearing black wool capes, each held fast at the neck by a heavy double gold chain that snaked out from beneath the cloak&#39;s turned-down collar. Isolated from the rest of the world by Japanese occupation, Shanghai had elaborated a few native fashions. Thanks to the extravagantly inflated price of gold in the occupied territories, gold chains as thick as these were now fabulously expensive. But somehow, functionally worn in place of a collar button, they managed to avoid the taint of vulgar ostentation, thereby offering their owners the perfect pretext for parading their wealth on excursions about the city. For these excellent reasons, the cape and gold chain had become the favored uniform of the wives of officials serving in Wang Ching-wei&#39;s puppet government. Or perhaps they were following the lead of Chungking, the Chinese Nationalist regime&#39;s wartime capital, where black cloaks were very much in vogue among the elegant ladies of the political glitterati.Yee Tai-tai was chez elle, so she had dispensed with her own cape; but even without it, her figure still seemed to bell outward from her neck, with all the weight the years had put on her. She&#39;d met Chia-chih two years earlier in Hong Kong, after she and her husband had left Chungking--and the Nationalist government--together with Wang Ching-wei. Not long before the couple took refuge on the island, one of Wang Ching-wei&#39;s lieutenants, Cheng Chung-ming, had been assassinated in Hanoi, and so Wang&#39;s followers in Hong Kong were keeping their heads down. Yee Tai-tai, nonetheless, was determined to go shopping. During the war, goods were scarce in both the unconquered interior and the occupied territories of the Mainland; Yee Tai-tai had no intention of wasting the golden purchasing opportunity offered by a stopover in the commercial paradise of Hong Kong. Someone in her circle introduced her to Chia-chih--the beautiful young wife of Mr. Mai, a local businessman--who chaperoned her on her shopping trips. If you wanted to navigate Hong Kong&#39;s emporiums, you had to have a local along: you were expected to haggle over prices even in the biggest department stores, and if you couldn&#39;t speak Cantonese, all the traders would overcharge you wickedly. Mr. Mai was in import-export and, like all businesspeople, delighted in making political friends. So of course the couple were incessantly hospitable to Yee Tai-tai, who was in turn extremely grateful. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the fall of Hong Kong, Mr. Mai went out of business. To make some extra money for the family, Mai Tai-tai decided to do a little smuggling herself, and traveled to Shanghai with a few luxury goods--watches, Western medicines, perfumes, stockings--to sell. Yee Tai-tai very naturally invited her to stay with them.&#34;We went to Shu-yu, that Szechuanese restaurant, yesterday,&#34; Yee Tai-tai was telling the first black cape. &#34;Mai Tai-tai hadn&#39;t been.&#34;&#34;Oh, really?&#34;&#34;We haven&#39;t seen you here for a few days, Ma Tai-tai.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve been busy--a family matter,&#34; Ma Tai-tai mumbled amid the twittering of the mahjong tiles.Yee Tai-tai&#39;s lips thinned into a smile. &#34;She went into hiding because it was her turn to buy dinner.&#34;Chia-chih suspected that Ma Tai-tai was jealous. Ever since Chia-chih had arrived, she had been the center of attention.&#34;Liao Tai-tai took us all out last night. She&#39;s been on such a winning streak the last couple of days,&#34; Yee Tai-tai went on to Ma Tai-tai. &#34;At the restaurant, I bumped into that young Mr. Lee and his wife and invited them to join us. When he said they were waiting for guests of their own, I told him they should all join us. After all, it isn&#39;t often that Liao Tai-tai gives dinner parties. Then it turned out Mr. Lee had invited so many guests we couldn&#39;t fit them all around our table. Even with extra chairs we couldn&#39;t all squeeze in, so Liao Tai-tai had to sit behind me like a singsong girl at a banquet. &#39;What a beauty I&#39;ve picked for myself tonight,&#39; I joked. &#39;I&#39;m too old a piece of tofu for you to swallow,&#39; she replied. &#39;Old tofu tastes the spiciest,&#39; I told her! Oh, how we laughed. She laughed so much her pockmarks turned red.&#34;More laughter around the mahjong table.While Yee Tai-tai was still updating Ma Tai-tai on the goings-on of the past couple of days, Mr. Yee came in, dressed in a gray suit, and nodded at his three female guests.&#34;You started early today.&#34;He stood behind his wife, watching the game. The wall behind him was swathed in heavy, yellowish-brown wool curtains printed with a brick-red phoenix-tail fern design, each blade almost six feet long. Chou Fo-hai, Wang Ching-wei&#39;s second in command, had a pair; and so, therefore, did they. False french windows, and enormous drapes to cover them, were all the rage just then. Because of the war, fabrics were in short supply; floor-length curtains such as those hanging behind Mr. Yee--using up an entire bolt of cloth, with extra wastage from pattern matching--were a conspicuous extravagance. Standing against the huge ferns of his backdrop, Yee looked even shorter than usual. His face was pale, finely drawn, and crowned by a receding hairline that faded away into petal-shaped peaks above his temples. His nose was distinguished by its narrowed, almost ratlike tip.&#34;Is that ring of yours three carats, Ma Tai-tai?&#34; Yee Tai-tai asked. &#34;The day before yesterday, P&#39;in Fen brought a five-carat diamond to show me, but it didn&#39;t sparkle like yours.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve heard P&#39;in Fen&#39;s things are better than the stuff in the shops.&#34;&#34;It is convenient to have things brought to your home, I suppose. And you can hold on to them for a few days, while you decide. And sometimes she has things you can&#39;t get elsewhere. Last time, she showed me a yellow kerosene diamond, but he wouldn&#39;t buy it.&#34; She glanced icily at Mr. Yee before going on: &#34;How much do you imagine something like that would cost now? A perfect kerosene diamond: a dozen ounces of gold per carat? Two? Three? P&#39;in Fen says no one&#39;s selling kerosene or pink diamonds at the moment, for any price. Everyone&#39;s hoarding them, waiting for the price to get even more insane.&#34;&#34;Didn&#39;t you feel how heavy it was?&#34; Mr. Yee laughed. &#34;Ten carats. You wouldn&#39;t have been able to play mahjong with that rock on your finger.&#34;The edges of the table glittered like a diamond exhibition, Chia-chih thought, every pair of hands glinting ostentatiously--except hers. She should have left her jadeite ring back in its box, she realized; to spare herself all those sneering glances.&#34;Stop making fun of me!&#34; Yee Tai-tai sulked as she moved out one of her counters. The black cape opposite Ma Tai-tai clatteringly opened out her winning hand, and a sudden commotion of laughter and lament broke the thread of conversation.As the gamblers busily set to calculating their wins and losses, Mr. Yee motioned slightly at Chia-chih with his chin toward the door.She immediately glanced at the two black capes on either side of her. Fortunately, neither seemed to have noticed. She paid out the chips she had lost, took a sip from her teacup, then suddenly exclaimed: &#34;That memory of mine! I have a business appointment at three o&#39;clock, I&#39;d forgotten all about it. Mr. Yee, will you take my place until I get back?&#34;&#34;I won&#39;t allow it!&#34; Yee Tai-tai protested. &#34;You can&#39;t just run away like that without warning us in advance.&#34;&#34;And just when I thought my luck was changing,&#34; muttered the winning black cape.&#34;I suppose we could ask Liao Tai-tai to come over. Go and telephone her,&#34; Yee Tai-tai went on to Chia-chih. &#34;At least stay until she gets here.&#34;&#34;I really need to go now.&#34; Chia-chih looked at her watch. &#34;I&#39;m going to be late--I arranged to have coffee with a broker. Mr. Yee can take my place.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m busy this afternoon,&#34; Mr. Yee excused himself. &#34;Tomorrow I&#39;ll play all night.&#34;&#34;That Wang Chia-chih!&#34; Yee Tai-tai liked referring to Chia-chih by her full maiden name, as if they had known each other since they were girls. &#34;I&#39;ll make you pay for this--you&#39;re going to treat us all to dinner tonight!&#34;&#34;You can&#39;t let your guest buy you dinner,&#34; Ma Tai-tai objected.&#34;I&#39;m siding with Yee Tai-tai,&#34; the other black cape put in.They needed to tread carefully around their hostess on the subject of her young houseguest. Although Yee Tai-tai was easily old enough to be Chia-chih&#39;s mother, there had never been any talk of formalizing their relationship, of adopting her as a goddaughter. Yee Tai-tai was a little unpredictable, at the age she was now. Although she had a dowager&#39;s fondness for keeping young, pretty women clustered around her--like a galaxy of stars reflecting glory onto the moon around which they circulated--she was not yet too old for flashes of feminine jealousy.&#34;All right, all right,&#34; Chia-chih said. &#34;I&#39;ll take you all out to dinner tonight. But you won&#39;t be in the party, Mr. Yee, if you don&#39;t take my place now.&#34;&#34;Do, Mr. Yee! Mahjong&#39;s no fun with only three. Play just for a little, while Ma Tai-tai telephones for a replacement.&#34;&#34;I really do have a prior engagement.&#34; Whenever Mr. Yee spoke of official business, his voice sank to an almost inaudibly discreet mutter. &#34;Someone else will come along soon.&#34;&#34;We all know how busy Mr. Yee is,&#34; Ma Tai-tai said.Was she insinuating something, Chia-chih wondered, or were nerves getting the better of her? Observing him smile and banter, Chia-chih even began to read a flattering undertone into Ma Tai-tai&#39;s remark, as if she knew that he wanted other people to coax the details of his conquest out of him. Perhaps success, she speculated, can turn the heads of even the professionally secretive.It was getting far too dangerous. If the job wasn&#39;t done today, if the thing were to drag on any longer, Yee Tai-tai would surely find them out.He walked off while she was still exhaustingly negotiating her exit with his wife. After finally extricating herself, she returned briefly to her room. As she finished hurriedly tidying her hair and makeup--there was too little time to change her clothes--the maidservant arrived to tell her the car was waiting for her at the door. Getting in, she gave the chauffeur instructions to drive her to a cafe; once arrived, she sent him back home.As it was only midafternoon, the cafe was almost deserted. Its large interior was lit by wall lamps with pleated apricot silk shades, its floor populated by small round tables covered in cloths of fine white linen jacquard--an old-fashioned, middlebrow kind of establishment. She made a call from the public telephone on the counter. After four rings, she hung up and redialed, muttering &#34;wrong number&#34; to herself, for fear the cashier might think her behavior strange.That was the code. The second time, someone answered.&#34;Hello?&#34;Thank goodness--it was K&#39;uang Yu-min. Even now, she was terrified she might have to speak to Liang Jun-sheng, though he was usually very careful to let others get to the phone first.&#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; she replied in Cantonese. &#34;Everyone well?&#34;&#34;All fine. How about yourself?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll be going shopping this afternoon, but I&#39;m not sure when.&#34;&#34;No problem. We&#39;ll wait for you. Where are you now?&#34;&#34;Hsia-fei Road.&#34;&#34;Fine.&#34;A pause.&#34;Nothing else then?&#34; Her hands felt cold, but she was somehow warmed by the sound of a familiar voice.&#34;No, nothing.&#34;&#34;I might go there right now.&#34;&#34;We&#39;ll be there, don&#39;t worry. See you later.&#34;She hung up and exited to hail a pedicab.If they didn&#39;t finish it off today, she couldn&#39;t stay on at the Yees&#39;--not with all those great bejeweled cats watching her every move. Maybe she should have found an excuse to move out as soon as she had hooked him. He could have found her a place somewhere: the last couple of times they&#39;d met in apartments, different ones each time, left vacant by British or Americans departed to war camps. But that probably would have made everything even more complicated--how would she have known what time he was coming? He might have suddenly descended upon her at any moment. Or if they had fixed a time in advance, urgent business might have forced him to cancel at the last minute. Calling him would also have been difficult, as his wife kept a close eye on him; she probably had spies stationed in all his various offices. A hint of suspicion and the whole thing would be undone: Shanghai crawled with potential informers, all of them eager to ingratiate themselves with the mighty Yee Tai-tai. And if Chia-chih had not pursued him so energetically, he might have cast her aside. Apartments were a popular parting gift to discarded mistresses of Wang Ching-wei&#39;s ministers. He had too many temptations jostling before him; far too many for any one moment. And if one of them weren&#39;t kept constantly in view, it would slip to the back of his mind and out of sight. No: he had to be nailed--even if she had to keep his nose buried between her breasts to do it.&#34;They weren&#39;t this big two years ago,&#34; he had murmured to her, in between kisses.His head against her chest, he hadn&#39;t seen her blush.Even now, it stung her to recall those knowing smirks--from all of them, K&#39;uang Yu-min included. Only Liang Jun-sheng had pretended not to notice how much bigger her breasts now looked. Some episodes from her past she needed to keep banished from her mind.It was some distance to the foreign concessions. When the pedicab reached the corner of Ching-an Temple and Seymour roads, she told him to stop by a small cafe. She looked around her, on the off chance that his car had already arrived. She could see only a vehicle with a bulky, charcoal-burning tank parked a little way up the street.</p><h2>Sarah&#39;s Quilt: A Novel of Sarah Agnes Prine and the Arizona Territories, 1906 (Sarah Agnes Prine Series, 2)</h2><p><p><i>Sarah's Quilt</i>, the long-awaited sequel to <i>These Is My Words</i>, continues the dramatic story of Sarah Agnes Prine.

She started college when her children were grown and completed a bachelor's degree in fine arts at the University of Arizona with a triple major in creative writing, music, and studio art. During the seven years it took to complete her degree, Turner is the author of the novels, <i>These Is My Words, The Water and the Blood </i>and <i>Sarah's Quilt, </i>her sequel to the bestselling <i>These Is My Words</i>.&nbsp; <i>Chapter One</i><i>April 24, 1906</i>I used the rifle to part branches as I ran. All I heard for a time was the rhythm of my boots scuffing gravel. My horse was standing where I&#x2019;d left him, his reins held by my niece Mary Pearl, who&#x2019;d been out checking stock with me since dawn. I knew not to ride a horse into that commotion. I thought I heard her hollering &#x201c;Aunt Sarah?&#x201d; but I didn&#x2019;t quit running toward the sound that had stopped us. As I tore through brush, an ironwood tree clutched at my clothes; thorns ripped my skirt. The troubled bellow of a cow was accompanied by a pitiful, higher-pitched bawling. Along with that, a pack of coyotes yipped.I cleared the rise. The mother cow whirled around at that second, hooked a coyote on one horn, and threw it high over her back. They were half-hidden by a thicket of greasewood and cholla&#x2014;in a clear place just wide enough for the pack of killers to trap the mother and baby. The calf had blood running down its legs and it whimpered. The mother cow dashed and whirled, fending off another and another coyote, as others circled behind her and nipped at her baby.I tried to yell, but I had no wind left. My throat was parched as old rope. I slung the rifle to my shoulder and picked off two coyotes. The crippled one had made it back into the path of the cow. As she tried to fight the coyote, it bit into her ankle, and she dragged it, its body clinging to her foot like a rag, before she got it loose. Fierce as she was, the coyotes knew their game was to outlast her, and while the mother cow thrashed, three more closed in on the calf. I ran again, this time finding my voice, shouting the whole way. Mary Pearl told me later that what I was hollering would not be fit talk for her mother&#x2019;s parlor, but I don&#x2019;t remember it.I pulled up the rifle again, chambering a shell as I did. With a shot, I dropped another coyote in his tracks, and he squirmed when he fell, but he didn&#x2019;t get up. The little calf dropped to its knees and then lay on its side. I could see then that the mother cow was torn in the milk bag. Streaky red liquid oozed from her wound. She stomped and shook that animal off her ankle as I shot another. When one coyote remained, he turned tail and lit out into the brush, gone like a drop of water in this hot desert. Well, I started to move toward the calf; then the panicked cow decided to come after me. She put her head low and scuffed at the dust. I took up part of my skirt and flapped it at her, waving my hat in the other hand, and she backed up, mooing, looking for danger from all around. The poor old girl was bleeding from the nose, too. I whistled and Mary Pearl came riding in my direction, leading my horse. Two baldhead buzzards looped in the sky overhead.The calf made a human-sounding wail. I knelt at its side. Poor baby was not two months into this hard world. I picked his little head up and laid it in my lap, coddling him as if he were a child. He&#x2019;d been bitten all around the gut and his sack was torn clear off. By the time the cow started back my way, I saw the calf&#x2019;s eyes sink and knew he was dead. The cow bandied her head and groaned. Mary Pearl tossed a rope around her neck and tied it off to the horse&#x2019;s saddle, then backed the horse, pulling that mother cow around. The coyotes had been at her worse than I&#x2019;d been able to see before. I&#x2019;d figured I could doctor up the milk bag&#x2014;I&#x2019;d done as much before. Not this one, though&#x2014;flesh hung from her leg and long blue veins dangled from her neck on the left side. Mary Pearl went to my horse, and from the saddle, she slung another rope over the cow&#x2019;s horns. She picketed the two horses so the cow was held between them.The cow thrashed, limping on her mangled hoof and ankle, and shook the second lariat from its loose hold on her horns. Mary Pearl backed her horse more to keep the line taut while the animal jerked against it. In midstride, the cow collapsed, breathing hard through a spew of blood and sand and slobber. Mary Pearl rode closer, easing the tension on the rope. She said, &#x201c;Aunt Sarah? Has she given in?&#x201d;I wiped my face with my sleeve and hung my head. Shock and fear had done what the coyotes couldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ve known cattle to outlast amazing things. Some don&#x2019;t. Maybe their hearts burst. Lord knows I&#x2019;ve felt that way, watching my own child die. The old girl pitched in the dirt and bellowed, but she didn&#x2019;t get up. I said, &#x201c;Ride on back to the house. Take my horse. I want to walk. I&#x2019;ll bring your rope by and by.&#x201d;I reckon Mary Pearl knew better than to fuss with me right then, for she did as I said without her usual commotion. I walked around the cow, talking to her, my voice soft and low. &#x201c;You fought &#x2019;em off, didn&#x2019;t you, old girl? Don&#x2019;t you go giving up now. You&#x2019;ll have another baby round the bend.&#x201d; Suddenly struggling to her feet, the cow made another threatening stance, lunged toward me, but then fell into the dirt, banging her great head against a rock outcrop. She moaned: a pitiful, suffering noise. It is a hard step for me&#x2014;always somewhat of a surprise&#x2014;to stop hoping and accept that there is no hope for an animal but a slow, agonizing death. My foreman shrugs and says it&#x2019;s part of ranching, but I hurt for my animals. I lifted the rifle and in my mind drew an <i>X</i> on her skull, midpoint between both eyes and the base of both horns. It isn&#x2019;t kind to do it poorly.The shot was loud in my ears, echoing as the cow slumped and went quiet. Then I sat between my dead cow and her dead calf, right there in the scrabble and brush, pulled up my knees, and cried. These last three years have seemed like an eternity of drought and poor harvest and dying animals. My boys are off at school, and to tell the truth, it&#x2019;s cheaper to send them to town, where they can pick up work, than to feed them here. I need money and I need rain. Both of them in good order and flowing over.After a while, I coiled Mary Pearl&#x2019;s rope and hung it over my shoulder. The rifle was heavy. My feet hurt. I beat the dust off my old hat, put it on my head, and started walking. I shook my head and didn&#x2019;t look back. The buzzards and the coyotes would have their day after all.<i>April 25, 1906</i>I knew soon as I spotted the riders and put names to them they were up to no good. I laid into the rug draped across my front porch rail with an iron beater, watching two men amble toward the house. Both were carrying good-size packs tied behind their saddles. It was early afternoon, and I had plenty of chores tallied to this day already. No sense waiting on a couple of slowpokes. I kept on whipping that rug, and let them get as close as the gate before I looked up and showed I&#x2019;d seen them coming. &#x201c;Charlie? Gilbert?&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;You two know what day it is?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, Mama,&#x201d; they said together. Charlie is twenty-one. Gilbert is but nineteen. My sons weren&#x2019;t due back from school for three weeks.&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you let me hear you&#x2019;ve failed out. I&#x2019;ll turn you out, to boot.&#x201d; I feared I knew the truth before they said it.Charlie spoke first. &#x201c;No, Mama. We haven&#x2019;t failed, either one of us. We just&#x2014;well, we changed our minds.&#x201d;I hit that rug two more licks. I said, &#x201c;Oh, you did?&#x201d; Charlie had been taking studies in engineering and mining. Gilbert was going to be a doctor.He said, &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;&#x201c;Both of you&#x2014;together&#x2014;changed your minds like they were one? What did you change them to?&#x201d; Felt like my eyeteeth had just come loose. There is a perfectly fine university right there in Tucson for them to use. A library full of books, some of which I put there myself, is just waiting for them to discover and love and enjoy it. And here they come like roosting pigeons. I shook all over, so mad I couldn&#x2019;t speak.Charlie stepped off his horse, holding his reins as if he was fixing to get back on.Gilbert was still on his horse. He, too, was debating whether just to keep riding. He finally said, &#x201c;Well, Mama, you don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know what hard work is like. You have a privilege not many get&#x2014;to use your minds instead of your backs&#x2014;and you turn away from it, like ... like it was tedious.&#x201d;Charlie scratched the animal&#x2019;s head between the ears and said, &#x201c;We want to be ranchers. Like you and Grampa. We aren&#x2019;t cut out for that place.&#x201d;I found myself fussing at his back. &#x201c;How will you know what you are cut out for if you don&#x2019;t try? Charlie, you were only a year and this term from finishing. This ranch will be here when you are done. Mount up and get back there. Tell your teachers you&#x2019;re sorry for being knotheads, and make up your work.&#x201d;&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t that easy,&#x201d; Charlie said, finally turning around to face me. He held the saddle in both hands. &#x201c;I missed the final examination in geology today. I&#x2019;d have to do the whole term again anyway. They just make it so hard on you, you can&#x2019;t get above water. Besides, all the science professor talks about is diamond mines in Africa. I&#x2019;ve turned enough rocks here to make a mountain, and there sure aren&#x2019;t diamonds under &#x2019;em. School&#x2019;s a waste of time when there&#x2019;s plenty of work to do here.&#x201d;I said, &#x201c;You two seemed to have time enough for plenty of other shenanigans. I heard about the armless saguaro some hooligans planted right in front of the main stairs. Looks like a blessed giant finger stuck in the ground&#x2014;in front of a <i>university.</i> It doesn&#x2019;t take a scholar to figure who might have been part of that.&#x201d;Gilbert finally dismounted, turned his face toward his saddle. He was barely hiding a grin, but still scared to look me in the eye. I said, &#x201c;I reckon there&#x2019;s some reason you&#x2019;re tagging along.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2014;well, I reckoned I&#x2019;d think it over awhile. Doctors hardly make enough money to keep a pot of beans on the stove. I&#x2019;d rather do something that puts some jingle in my pockets. Why, a vanilla drummer makes as much as a doctor, and he doesn&#x2019;t have to study chemistry or cut open cadavers.&#x201d; He eyed that rug beater in my hands as he smiled.All my life, I&#x2019;ve ached for the chance to sit in a real schoolroom, but I never got the privilege. I set myself to lay into them, but I&#x2019;d as soon argue with the daylight. They&#x2019;d already done what they meant to do. Maybe I never went to school, but I reckon I&#x2019;m smart enough to know when I&#x2019;m licked. Licked for now maybe, but not finished with this fight. So I said, &#x201c;How are your cousins?&#x201d; Savannah and Albert&#x2019;s twin girls and second son&#x2014;Rachel, Rebeccah, and Joshua&#x2014;the ones these two were supposed to be sharing my house in town with. The ones who&#x2019;d stayed in school. &#x201c;You say hello to your aunt and uncle as you rode in?&#x201d; My brother and his wife and family lived just a scant mile up the road from me.I could see the boys let their shoulders down. They knew they&#x2019;d won this go-round. Gilbert took the pack off his horse and began loosening the saddle&#x2019;s cinch strap. At the same time, both of them said, &#x201c;Fine. They&#x2019;re all just fine,&#x201d; mumbling something or other about Rachel&#x2019;s cooking.&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s cadavers?&#x201d; I said.Gilbert said, &#x201c;Dead folks. <i>Pickled</i> dead folks. After the second one, well&#x2014;&#x201d;I headed toward the house, saying over my shoulder, &#x201c;Well, if you hadn&#x2019;t got the stomach for that, you hadn&#x2019;t. Come on in, and I&#x2019;ll feed you. Put those animals in the west corral. Pillbox just foaled, and I don&#x2019;t want you in the barn, upsetting her.&#x201d;Even from the porch, I could see in their eyes that they were smiling, although they knew better than to look smart in front of me. One thing I know is that you can&#x2019;t let up on boys. Just because they&#x2019;re big as a man, you give them any slack, and they&#x2019;ll run sidelong into trouble. I&#x2019;m about fed up with these two, I thought. Reckon I&#x2019;ll make them some lunches, and then figure what to do with them. Might as well invite Albert and Savannah and the rest for supper tonight, let them know the two renegades are back. Sorry rascals.There&#x2019;s a single cloud in the sky. It looks pretty sickly, and I doubt it will prove its mettle. We as much as missed the spring rains. Maybe the summer&#x2019;s wet weather will come early, and get some grass growing before we go broke buying feed for cattle that already look like walking beef jerky.My sons were still tending their horses when Ezra and Zachary, Albert&#x2019;s youngest boys, came along. They had a cord of some sort stretched tight between them and they trotted in circles around each other. They were each toting a slate and a book under one arm. Their bare feet stirred up dust as they came.&#x201c;Aunt Sarah,&#x201d; Ezra called, &#x201c;watch us. Watch! Planetary motion.&#x201d; They whirled up the road, and Ezra howled as if he were the wind; then he jerked the string hard and tugged his little brother forward.I laughed. Ezra and Zachary are my last two students, and I don&#x2019;t aim to short them on their readiness for the university.As they got to the house, Zack was running with all his might. They both stopped at my front steps. Zack put his hands on his knees to catch his breath. He gasped, &#x201c;You sorry old buzzard, Ezra. I told you to slow down. I&#x2019;m played clear out.&#x201d;I called through the kitchen window, &#x201c;Both of you come on in. Ezra, you&#x2019;ll have to do your recitation first, so Zack can have enough wind to say his piece.&#x201d; Ezra moaned and followed Zack to the parlor, where they dropped to the floor and fanned themselves with their slates. I said, &#x201c;Your cousins are home from town. We&#x2019;re all going to eat first, and then you can do your lessons.&#x201d;Ezra said, &#x201c;Can we go see &#x2019;em? May we? I mean.&#x201d;I said, &#x201c;Nope. Just cool off in here. They&#x2019;ll be in directly.&#x201d;Almost the minute I&#x2019;d said it, Charlie and Gilbert came at a near run to the house and flung wide the door.Charlie said, &#x201c;Mama, are you sick?&#x201d;My sons&#x2019; faces bore childlike expressions of fear. Ezra and Zack cheered and howled at the sight of them, mindless of their cousins&#x2019; worried looks. I had to raise my voice to be heard over the commotion. &#x201c;Nothing of the kind,&#x201d; I said.Charlie said, &#x201c;When we put the saddles away, we saw old Mr. Sparky had been moved. Went to see what he was sitting on.&#x201d;Mr. Sparky was what I reckon you&#x2019;d call a toy. A scarecrow, topped off with a skull the boys had been given when the army shut down Fort Lowell and folks turned it into a marketplace. The telegrapher used to keep an old human skull in the office with glass eyeballs plugged into the eye holes and the snaggletoothed chinbone spring-wired to the ticker line. When a message came in, that jaw would ratchet up and down and the eyes would roll in their sockets. Indians would come for miles around just to set and wait for a message, then hoot and roll with laughter at the thing. After Jack died, some of the men at the fort sort of kept an eye on my boys when we were in town, and one of them rode clear out here to see if Charlie wanted Sparky when they left. I&#x2019;d laughed and told him it wasn&#x2019;t like a puppy, but Charlie was happy, and later he and Gilbert took some clothes they&#x2019;d both outgrown and stuffed Mr. Sparky a body.Halloweens, Sparky keeps guard duty at the outhouse for us, which saves it being turned over like most of the other privies around. Other times, he appears now and then, just for the fun of it. Once, I got up on a Christmas morning to find what looked like a saddle tramp snoozing under a sombrero in a rocking chair on the front porch, his boots sticking from under an old blanket. About the time I guessed the old cuss was dead and started to use a stick to lift the sombrero, one of Sparky&#x2019;s glass eyeballs fell out and rolled across the porch. Gilbert and Charlie were laughing so hard at the corner of the house,...</p><h2>Mantra Yoga and Primal Sound: Secret of Seed (Bija) Mantras</h2><p>Modern science and ancient wisdom traditions agree that the universe is a symphony of vibrational frequencies.

How do you start? What materials should you use? Are composition and perspective important? These questions and others are answered in detail in this impressive book, with a clarity that guarantees success. Whether you want to purely abstract your ideas, thoughts and feelings into colour and mood, or whether you want to base your pictures on subjects that interest you, such as landscapes, flowers, or music, you will find much to guide and fascinate you here. Rolina van Vliet is an enthusiastic teacher, and she offers a brilliant insight into what makes good paintings, with 50 stunning projects, each accompanied by expert tips and a full palette of exciting and fun techniques. With help on what materials to use and how to use them, she includes many photographs illustrating different ways to create smooth, textured, collaged, vibrant, powerful and atmospheric abstract art. Beginners will love the way Rolina encourages experimentation - there are no rules, and more experienced artists will find much here to inspire them.</p><p>Rolina van Vliet has studied at the Academy of Physical Education in Groningen, the teacher training department of Amsterdam College, and the fine arts department at the Free Academy in The Hague. She now teaches at various centres for artistic training, and has developed a new method of painting based on abstract painting. Her work varies from abstract expressionism to lyrical abstract painting, with the emphasis on spontaneity and dynamics, and with a clear preference for total abstraction. She regularly exhibits her work, has written articles for art magazines and runs workshops and courses on abstract art.This is a nice change of direction in the literature of abstract painting. When it comes to abstracts, it's the ideas behind the work that mainly count and it's difficult to come up with a strictly instructional approach because you're not simply representing a subject but interpreting it and, if you don't have something to say, there's not really any point in even getting started. However, there are various muscles you can develop and working from a set of ideas and exercises based on what other artists have done will help you get the idea of where you're supposed to be going and how you might get there. Rolina has come up with a good range of approaches such as the interplay of lines, monochrome working, even painting from photographs and to music. This latter is something that's cropped up before and is an intriguing idea - you use a favourite piece to put yourself in a specific frame of mind and then simply (well, I say, "simply") transfer that creativity to paper. As well as the projects, Rolina has some useful comments on where you might look for sources of inspiration and, in her conclusion, a list of do's and don'ts that every artist should have taped to their studio wall.-Artbookreview.net Abstract art can be a notoriously difficult genre to teach but experienced tutor Rolina van Vliet begins with a very positive statement of intent in this, her third book on the subject. Posing the question, 'Why paint in the abstract style?', she underlines the benefits of working in this way, from the joy of interpretation to the freedom from rigid techniques. Nevertheless, she still provides a very organised framework for developing your skills - each of the 50 subsequent projects list what materials you need and which skills you can acquire.-Artists &amp; Illustrators This book follows Rolinas two very successful and acclaimed previous books on abstract painting and covers the questions so often asked what shall I paint and How shall I paint it. Until I began painting myself I rarely appreciated abstract art having seen too much of the "throw some paint at a canvas and call it an abstract" type of works. Sadly there's still a lot of that type around but with books such as these by Rolina hopefully people who are interested in art will take time to learn a more disciplined and structured approach. Rolina has developed a theory and background of abstract painting that she has outlined in her previous books and in this one she puts some of those ideas into practice devising exercises to hone the skills learned by the student from them. The first third of the book is full of ideas to make us think about what we want to paint and how to approach it. Rolina explains how to see abstractly - many paintings are actually based around pictorial elements that the artist then looks for the abstract in them - very different to the throw paint and see method that I talked about earlier. Through thinking about external influences we begin to process the ideas for a painting - Rolina gives us some guidelines on how to develop these ideas by way of questioning ourselves, what colour combinations do we want to use, what shapes and lines are we planning, will we add texture, will this be totally abstract or will elements of the original idea be visible. She explains all this is important preparatory work to create a pleasing and successful painting. She covers sources of inspiration, picture elements and colours, and texture and technique - al these are covered in more detail in earlier books but for the purpose of this book a brief overview is given. The projects themselves are broken down into specific elements - study task, materials, picture elements, techniques, and composition. In this way Rolina gives the basics of the project accompanied by an illustration of some she has created using each method and yet the final project will be the students own work. Most of the projects are accompanied by useful study tips that will be helpful when the student branches out entirely on their own work. I really enjoy Rolinas books - they are packed full of helpful and easy to follow ideas. I think anyone new to abstract works will find that they are in fact far more structured than usually believed and whether you are an artist want to learn to create your own abstract works or simply have a love of art and want to learn to appreciate the work involved in abstract paintings this book is a winner.-JeannieZelos.com Have you always wanted to try abstract painting but are not sure where to start? There is surely more to it than just the random application of paint - yes there is, and here is a whole book of ideas for the beginner abstract artist. This is essentially a very hands-on book filled with projects to try an approach which I personally think works very well indeed. At the outset the author explains how abstract art has its roots in the figurative, but ideas are expressed in a freer manner. She discusses concepts, line, color, inspiration and more before the main section of the book, which is where you can find the projects. Most of these involve acrylics rather than any other paint type, which suits the modern style and which are very versatile. Try your hand at playing with lines, mixed media, collage, depicting organic forms, emulating Picasso, using newspaper cuttings and many more. Each study has simple instructions and ideas to try along with an example and the studies number fifty. After these there are a hundred one-line ideas to try, such as creating an image to go with the last book you read, using a paper ball to make textures and making a Matisse-style paper cutout collage. All of these ideas are sure to free up the imagination and produce some vibrant and interesting work, so if you want to have a go at this style of art then this is a good book to start with. You do need some basic art history knowledge first in order to know the work of named artists, but as all these are well known this should not pose a problem for many artists.-Myshelf.com Abstraction is not as often discussed in art guides as figurative painting. Given its subjectivity, abstraction is inherently difficult to teach, but van Vliet ( The Art of Abstract Painting ) commendably spends as much time covering concepts and inspiration as she does technique. The 50 short exercises function well as experimental jumping-off points for readers rather than as finished projects. In these lessons, van Vliet emphasizes process through a wide-ranging, succinct discussion of many different materials. This book will appeal to beginning and intermediate artists who want to try something new.-Library Journal USA</p><h2>The Mayo Clinic Handbook for Happiness: A Four-Step Plan for Resilient Living</h2><p>Happiness is a habit.

That is, until one night in 1976 while drinking a pint at a Dublin pub, he receives an anonymous note implying that she may have been forced to give him up.

Pretending to be harmless.<br> <br>If Mahony could remember the place, which he can&#x2019;t of course, he&#x2019;d not notice many changes since he&#x2019;s been gone. Mulderrig doesn&#x2019;t change, fast or slowly. Twenty-six years makes no odds.<br> <br>For Mulderrig is a place like no other. Here the colors are a little bit brighter and the sky is a little bit wider. Here the trees are as old as the mountains and a clear river runs into the sea. People are born to live and stay and die here. They don&#x2019;t want to go. Why would they when all the roads that lead to Mulderrig are downhill so that leaving is uphill all the way?<br> <br>At this time of the day the few shops are shuttered and closed, and the signs swing with an after-hours lilt and pitch, and the sun-warmed shop front letters bloom and fade. Up and down the high street, from Adair&#x2019;s Pharmacy to Farr&#x2019;s Outfitters, from the offices of Gibbons &amp; McGrath Solicitors to the Post Office and General Store, all is quiet.<br> <br>A couple of old ones are sitting by the painted pump in the middle of the square. You&#x2019;ll get no talk from them today: they are struck dumb by the weather, for it hasn&#x2019;t rained for days and days and days. It&#x2019;s the hottest April in living and dead memory. So hot that the crows are flying with their tongues hanging out of their heads.<br> <br>The driver nods to Mahony. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if a hundred summers have come at once to the town, when a mile along the coast the rain&#x2019;s hopping up off the ground and there&#x2019;s a wind that would freeze the tits off a hen. If you ask me,&#x201d; says the driver, &#x201c;it all spells a dose of trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony watches the bus turn out of the square in a broiling cloud of dirt. It rolls back, passengerless, across the narrow stone bridge that spans a listless river. In this weather anything that moves will be netted in a fine caul of dust. Although not much is moving now, other than a straggle of kids pelting home late, leaving their clear cries ringing behind. The mammies are inside making the tea and the daddies are inside waiting to go out for a jar. And so Tadhg Kerrigan is the first living soul in the village to see Mahony back.<br> <br>Tadhg is propping up the saloon door of Kerrigan&#x2019;s Bar having changed a difficult barrel and threatened a cellar rat with his deadly tongue. He is setting his red face up to catch a drop of sun while scratching his arse with serious intent. He has been thinking of the Widow Farelly, of her new-built bungalow, the prodigious whiteness of her net curtains and the pigeon plumpness of her chest.<br> <br>Tadhg gives Mahony a good hard stare across the square as he walks over to the bar. With looks like that, thinks Tadhg, the fella is either a poet or a gobshite, with the long hair and the leather jacket and the walk on it, like his doesn&#x2019;t smell.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right so?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m grand,&#x201d; says Mahony, putting his rucksack down and smiling up through his hair, an unwashed variety that&#x2019;s grown past his ears and then some.<br> <br>Tadhg decides that this fella is most definitely a gobshite.<br> <br>Whether the dead of Mulderrig agree or not it&#x2019;s difficult to tell, but they begin to look out cautiously from bedroom windows or drift faintly down the back lanes to stop short and stare.<br> <br>For the dead are always close by in a life like Mahony&#x2019;s. The dead are drawn to the confused and the unwritten, the damaged and the fractured, to those with big cracks and gaps in their tales, which the dead just yearn to fill. For the dead have secondhand stories to share with you, if you&#x2019;d only let them get a foot in the door.<br> <br>But the dead can watch. And they can wait.<br> <br>For Mahony doesn&#x2019;t see them now.<br> <br>He stopped seeing them a long time ago.<br> <br>Now the dead are confined to a brief scud across the room at lights-out, or a wobble now and then in his peripheral vision. Now Mahony can ignore them in much the same way as you&#x2019;d ignore the ticks of an over-loud grandfather clock.<br> <br>So Mahony pays no notice at all to the dead old woman pushing her face through the wall next to Tadhg&#x2019;s right elbow. And Tadhg pays no notice either, for, like the rest of us, he is blessed with a blissful lack of vision.<br> <br>The dead old woman opens a pair of briny eyes as round as vinegar eggs and looks at Mahony, and Mahony looks away, smiling full into Tadhg&#x2019;s big face. &#x201c;So are there any digs about the town, pal?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no work here.&#x201d; Tadhg crosses his arms high on his chest and sniffs woefully.<br> <br>Mahony produces a half pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket and Tadhg takes one. They stand smoking awhile, Tadhg with his eyes narrowed against the sun, Mahony with a shadow of a smile on his face. The dead old woman slips out a good few inches above the pavement and points enigmatically down towards the cellar, muttering darkly.<br> <br>Mahony increases his smile to show his teeth in an expression of considerable natural charm altogether capable of beguiling the hardest bastard of humankind. &#x201c;Well, the last thing I need is work. I&#x2019;m taking a break from the city.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the city, is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>The dead old woman draws close enough to whisper in Mahony&#x2019;s ear.<br> <br>Mahony takes a drag and then exhales. &#x201c;It is. With the noise and the cars and the rats.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rats, are there?&#x201d; Tadhg narrows his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;As big as sheep.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg is outwardly unmoved, although he sympathizes deep in his soul. &#x201c;Rats are a very great problem in the world,&#x201d; he says sagely.<br> <br>&#x201c;They are in Dublin.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what brought you here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted a bit of peace and quiet. Do you know on the map there&#x2019;s nothing at all around you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the arse end of beyond you&#x2019;re after then?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony looks thoughtful. &#x201c;Do you know? I think it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ve found it. You&#x2019;re on the run in the Wild West?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seems so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A lady or the law?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony takes his cigarette out of his mouth and flicks it in the direction of the dead old woman, who throws a profoundly disgusted look at him. She lifts her filmy skirts and flits back through the wall of the pub.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was no lady.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg&#x2019;s face twitches as he curbs a smile. &#x201c;What are we calling you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mahony.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg notes a good firm handshake. &#x201c;Mahony it is then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So will I find a bed tonight or will I have to curl up with those antiques on the bench there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg withholds a fart, just while he&#x2019;s thinking. &#x201c;Shauna Burke rents out rooms to paying guests at Rathmore House up in the forest. That&#x2019;s about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;d be grand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg takes a thorough glance at Mahony. He&#x2019;ll admit that he has a sort of bearing about him. He&#x2019;s not a bad height and he&#x2019;s strong looking, handy even. He&#x2019;s been into his twenties and he&#x2019;ll come out again the other side none the worse for it; he has the kind of face that will stay young. But he could do with a wash; he has the stubble of days on his chin. And his trousers are ridiculous: tight around the crotch and wide enough at the bottom to mop the main road.<br> <br>Tadhg nods at them. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all the rage now? Them trousers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They are, yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you not feel like a bit of an eejit wearing them?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony smiles. &#x201c;They all wear &#x2019;em in town. There&#x2019;s wider.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg raises his eyebrows a fraction. &#x201c;Is there now? Well, you wouldn&#x2019;t want to be caught in a gust of wind.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg can see that the girls would be falling over themselves if this fella ever had the notion to shave himself or pick up a bar of soap. And Mahony knows it too. It&#x2019;s there in the curve of his smile and the light in his dark eyes. It&#x2019;s in the way he moves, like he owns every inch of himself.<br> <br>Tadhg stakes a smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to watch the other guest who lives up there, Mrs. Cauley. The woman&#x2019;s titanic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;After what I&#x2019;ve been afflicted with I&#x2019;m sure I can handle her.&#x201d; And Mahony turns his laughing eyes up to Tadhg.<br> <br>Now Tadhg is not a man given to remarkable insights but he is suddenly certain of two things.<br> <br>One: that he&#x2019;s seen those eyes before.<br> <br>Two: that he is almost certainly having a stroke.<br> <br>For the blood inside Tadhg has begun to belt around his body for the first time in a very long time and he knows that it can&#x2019;t be good to stir up a system that has been sumping and rusting to a comfortable dodder. Tadhg puts his hands over his face and leans heavily against the saloon door. He can almost feel a big fecker of a blood clot hurtling towards his brain to knock him clean out of the living world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you all right, pal?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg opens his eyes. The fella who is having a break from Dublin is frowning up at him. Tadhg reels off a silent prayer against the darkest of Mulderrig&#x2019;s dark dreams. He takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes his forehead. And as the hairs settle on the back of his neck he tells himself that this fella is really no more than a stranger.<br> <br>Whatever he thought he saw in his face has gone.<br> <br>In front of him is a Dublin hippy passing through the arse end of beyond.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tadhg nods. &#x201c;I am, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>The stranger smiles. &#x201c;You open? I could do time for a pint.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come inside now,&#x201d; Tadhg says, and resolutely decides to lay off the sunshine.<br> <br>Luckily the sun has a desperate struggle to get in through the windows of Kerrigan&#x2019;s Bar, but if it can seep through the smoky curtains it can alight on the sticky dark wood tables. Or it can work up a dull shine on the horse brasses by the side of the fire, unlit and full of crisp packets. Or it can bathe the pint of stout in Sergeant Jack Brophy&#x2019;s hand to an even richer, warmer hue.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jack, this is Mahony.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony puts his rucksack by the door.<br> <br>Jack turns to look at him. He nods. &#x201c;Get the man a pint, Tadhg. Here, Mahony, sit by me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony sits down next to Jack, a strong square wall of a man, and, like all mortals, he begins to feel soothed. Mahony isn&#x2019;t to know that Jack has this effect on the mad, the bad, the imaginative, and skittish horses, whether off duty or on. Ask anyone and they will tell you it&#x2019;s what makes Jack a good cop&#x2014;a great guard. For here he is working his stretch of the coast, sorting out the wicked, the misjudged, and the maligned without having to once raise his voice.<br> <br>Tadhg puts a pint in front of Mahony.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, tell me about it,&#x201d; says Jack, barely moving his lips.<br> <br>Mahony could tell him about it. Mahony could start by telling Jack what happened last Thursday.<br> <br><br> <br>Last Thursday, Father Gerard McNamara walked into the Bridge Tavern with a black leather folio in his hand and an envelope inside the folio. He was seeking one of St. Anthony&#x2019;s most notorious alumni and had started by visiting the bars within a one-mile radius of the orphanage. For Father McNamara was heeding the advice of the local guards along with the principle that a rotten apple doesn&#x2019;t fall far from the tree; it usually lands and festers right next to it.<br> <br>Mahony was emanating from the jacks with a cigarette in his mouth as Father McNamara came round the side of the bar.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a word with you, Mahony.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony took out his cigarette and squinted at the priest. &#x201c;Sit yourself down, have a drink with me, Father.&#x201d;<br> <br>The priest threw Mahony a caustic look, put the folio on the bar, and unzipped it.<br> <br>Mahony pulled himself back up onto his stool and took hold of his pint with serious dedication. &#x201c;Ah, excuse me, I didn&#x2019;t shake your hand, did I, Father? You see I&#x2019;ve just touched something far from godly but just as capable of inflicting bliss.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim behind the bar grinned.<br> <br>Father McNamara extracted the envelope from his folio. &#x201c;Sister Veronica passed away. She asked for this to be given to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mahony looked at the letter on the bar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you got the right man, Father? Sister Veronica wasn&#x2019;t exactly head of me fan club now, was she? Why would she be leaving me anything? God rest her pure and caring soul.&#x201d;<br> <br>Father McNamara shrugged. He didn&#x2019;t give a shite; he just wanted to get out of the pub.<br> <br>Mahony watched Father McNamara zip up his leather folio, put it under his arm, and walk back out through the saloon door into the weak Dublin sunshine. Mahony finished his pint, ordered another, and looked at the envelope. Then he found himself remembering.<br> <br>He was no more than six.<br> <br>Sister Veronica said that there wasn&#x2019;t a letter left with him. Wasn&#x2019;t he a little bastard that no one wanted and why would anyone be writing letters for him?<br> <br>Sister Veronica said that his mammy was too busy working the docks to write.<br> <br>Sister Veronica said that his mammy had only brought him to the nuns instead of drowning him because she couldn&#x2019;t find a bucket.<br> <br>But Sister Mary Margaret had told Mahony a different story, while she had taught him to hold a pencil and form his letters, and recognize all the major saints and many of the minor ones.<br> <br>Once upon a time Sister Mary Margaret had answered a loud knocking at the door of the orphanage. It was very early one morning, before the city was awake. All the pigeons had their heads tucked under their wings and all the rats were curled up tight behind the dustbins. All the cars and lorries were asleep in their garages and depots, and all the trains slumbered on their tracks at Connolly Station. All the boats bobbed gently in the harbor, dreaming of the high seas, and all the bicycles slept leaning along the fences. Even the angels were asleep at the foot of the O&#x2019;Connell Monument, fluttering their wings as they dreamt, quite forgetting to hold still and pretend to be statues.<br> <br>The whole wide city was asleep when Sister Mary Margaret opened the door of the orphanage.<br> <br>And there, on the steps, was a baby.<br> <br>Of all the things in the world!<br> <br>A baby in a basket, with a quilt of leaves and a pillow of rose petals.<br> <br>A baby in a basket, just like Moses!<br> <br>The baby had looked up at Sister Mary Margaret with two bright eyes and smiled at her. And she had smiled right back.<br> <br>Mahony clung on to the bar. He couldn&#x2019;t light a cigarette or pick up his pint, he couldn&#x2019;t move, the sweat was pouring off him. He closed his eyes and right there in his memory he found Sister Mary Margaret, as she was the last time he saw her.<br> <br>He was not even seven. At first he had held back from climbing up, for fear that he would break her. But Sister Mary Margaret had smiled down at him, so he scaled the arctic landscape of the bed. Without that smile he wouldn&#x2019;t have known her.<br> <br>Sister Mary Margaret had a cancer the size of a man&#x2019;s head in her stomach and was as good as dead under the ground. That&#x2019;s what they had told him but he&#x2019;d come to see for himself.<br> <br>He sat next to Sister Mary Margaret and let her wipe his nose with her handkerchief although he was too old for it. It took her hours because she kept falling asleep. He had wished to God that he wasn&#x2019;t trailing great lanes of snot. But Mahony always had a cold from the fact that the tops of his fingers were often blue and his socks were never quite dry.<br> <br>She had looked at him with her shrunken face on one side and he&#x2019;d looked back ...</p><h2>The Adventures of Alexander Von Humboldt</h2><p><b><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Invention of Nature</i></b><b>, comes a breathtakingly illustrated and brilliantly evocative recounting of Alexander Von Humboldt's five year expedition in South America. </b></b><br><br>Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) was an intrepid explorer and the most famous scientist of his age. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, but his most revolutionary idea was a radical vision of nature as a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone. His theories and ideas were profoundly influenced by a five-year exploration of South America. Now Andrea Wulf partners with artist Lillian Melcher to bring this daring expedition to life, complete with excerpts from Humboldt's own diaries, atlases, and publications. She gives us an intimate portrait of the man who predicted human-induced climate change, fashioned poetic narrative out of scientific observation, and influenced iconic figures such as Sim�n Bol�var, Thomas Jefferson, Charles Darwin, and John Muir. This gorgeous account of the expedition not only shows how Humboldt honed his groundbreaking understanding of the natural world but also illuminates the man and his passions.</p><p><b>ANDREA WULF</b> lives in London. She is the author of <i>Chasing Venus, Founding Gardeners, The Brother Gardeners</i>, which was long-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize and awarded the American Horticultural Society Book Award, and <i>The Invention of Nature</i>, a national best seller that won the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize, the Costa Biography Award, and the Royal Geographical Society Ness Award and was named one of <i>The New York Times </i>Top 10 Books of the Year.

Now his dread has become a certainty, and he has been arrested for the arson murder of twenty-six people.</p><p>What he needs now is defense lawyer Andy Carpenter, who most definitely is not in the market for a new client. So Noah plays his hole card: a shared love for Andy's golden retriever, Tara, and the knowledge of what her life was like before Andy rescued her. Because Andy wasn't her first owner&#x2015;Noah rescued Tara first, and when he wasn't able to care for her any longer, he did everything in his power to make sure that she was placed in the right home: Andy's.<br>With that knowledge, Andy has little choice but to take Noah on, and he soon learns that the long-ago event that may destroy Noah's life is only the beginning of an ongoing conspiracy that grows more deadly by the day. Andy will have to pull out all of his tricks to get to the bottom of this cold case turned white hot in <i>One Dog Night</i>, the latest in David Rosenfelt's popular mystery series.</p></p><p>DAVID ROSENFELT is the Edgar and Shamus Award-nominated author of more than a dozen Andy Carpenter novels, including <i>Collared</i>. He and his wife live in Maine with the twenty-seven golden retrievers that they've rescued.ONE DOG NIGHT (CHAPTER ONE)<p>When they came into the room, Noah Galloway looked at his watch.</p><p>It made no sense; he knew that as he was doing it. Noah had waited for them to arrive for six years, three months, and twenty-one days, and it was of no consequence what time of day it was when he finally saw them. Nor did he have any doubt who they were and why they were there. They might as well have been carrying a sign.</p><p>What mattered was that life as he knew it was over.</p><p>The audience giggled a little when he checked his watch; it&#x2019;s not the kind of thing you do during a speech. It makes it look like you&#x2019;re either bored, or anxious for it to end, or both. Noah remembered that the first President Bush got in political trouble when he did it during a debate with Clinton and Perot. But Noah was now in that kind of trouble times a thousand.</p><p>He was glad he was near the end of the speech, with only about a page and a half left. It was going to be hard to concentrate on the rest, but he&#x2019;d muddle through. No sense cutting short the last speech he would ever give.</p><p>What remained of his ego also forced him to finish. While at that moment no one considered the speech in any way important, Noah knew that it would be replayed over and over on television, and would go viral within minutes. He didn&#x2019;t want to seem flustered, or panicked.</p><p>He would go down with what little was left of his dignity. He owed that much to Becky and Adam.</p><p>The four men had stopped, two on the left and two on the right, on each side of the stage. They were all dressed in dark grey suits, with apparently identical blue shirts and grey ties. They looked like a semiformal bowling team, waiting to receive their championship trophy.</p><p>&#x201c;The battlefield extends farther than the streets of Detroit, the harbor in Miami, and the border with Mexico. It extends around the world; drugs are a global epidemic and all of us are facing the scourge together.</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow, as most of you know, I will have the privilege of flying to Istanbul, where I will meet with representatives of fifty-one nations. I am not going there to dictate policy, to tell anyone it&#x2019;s &#x2018;our way or the highway.&#x2019; I am going there to convey our President&#x2019;s message, and I am going there to listen.&#x201d;</p><p>Noah saw no reason to change the basic text of the speech; no one would care about the words anyway. He knew full well he was no longer going to Istanbul, and within minutes the world would know that his transgressions were a lot more serious than an inaccurate speech.</p><p>&#x201c;Much in our modern world can be seen in both black and white; it seems as if everything comes with a &#x2018;plus&#x2019; and &#x2018;minus&#x2019; attached. Airplanes let us travel quickly across the planet, but the skies are much dirtier and louder for it. The Internet brings lightning-fast information, but that information is often abused and incorrect. Social networks let us connect with thousands of people, but the word &#x2018;friend&#x2019; is devalued in the process.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the abuse of drugs offers no such choice, no inherent dichotomy. There is no upside to it, no rationalization we can make. It destroys and it debases all that it touches, with nothing positive left in its wake.&#x201d;</p><p>Noah paused and looked around the auditorium. He was at the same time sorry and glad that Becky was not there, that she was taking Adam to the nursery-school parents&#x2019; visiting day. It would be a horrible thing for her to witness; he could imagine the shock on her face, the outrage that would over time turn to devastation and, ultimately, acceptance.</p><p>But he knew that he would have to face her eventually, and that would be just as awful. He had let her down even before he knew her; let her down in a way that was horrible and unforgivable.</p><p>&#x201c;So there are some who say we are in a war, and some who would not use that terminology. But it is certain that we are in a battle, a battle to reach our full potential as human beings. The good news is that the enemy is not hiding. He does not plant IEDs, or shoot from a covered position.</p><p>&#x201c;This is an enemy we know, one which we can and will control, because the enemy is ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>The applause was polite and restrained, which was to be expected. The platitudes he&#x2019;d given them were nothing they hadn&#x2019;t heard for many years from many officials, and bitter experience had told everyone that actions would speak much louder than words. And over time those actions had not spoken very loudly at all.</p><p>Noah understood that, just as he understood he would not be taking any more actions, ever again.</p><p>Noah smiled, turned, and left the stage. Out of the corners of his eyes he noticed the four men rise at the same time, and move to where they would approach him. He walked to the right to meet two of them in a place that would be out of the sightline of the audience.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Galloway, Special Agent Joseph Scarlett, Federal Bureau of Investigation.&#x201d; As the man talked, he took out and showed his identification to Noah, providing visual confirmation of his words.</p><p>Noah didn&#x2019;t say anything, but was conscious of the other two men coming up behind him, to prevent him from trying to escape. Their presence wasn&#x2019;t necessary; Noah was not going to cause any trouble.</p><p>Agent Scarlett proceeded to tell him that he was under arrest, and he read him his rights. Noah was only half listening; he was in a bit of a daze, trying to process the fact that after all these years, his horrible secret was not a secret any longer.</p><p>Scarlett was finished speaking, and seemed surprised that Noah was not responding, not even asking why he was being arrested. &#x201c;Is there a statement you would like to make, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>Noah paused a moment before saying, &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Then, &#x201c;Take me away.&#x201d;</p><p>ONE DOG NIGHT Copyright � 2011 by Tara Productions, Inc</p></p><h2>The End of Loneliness: A Novel</h2><p><b>From internationally bestselling author Benedict Wells, a sweeping novel of love and loss, and of the lives we never get to live&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;[D]azzling storytelling...<i>The End of Loneliness</i> is both affecting and accomplished -- and eternal.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>John Irving </b><br><br> Jules Moreau&#x2019;s childhood is shattered after the sudden death of his parents. Enrolled in boarding school where he and his siblings, Marty and Liz, are forced to live apart, the once vivacious and fearless Jules retreats inward, preferring to live within his memories &#x2013; until he meets Alva, a kindred soul caught in her own grief. Fifteen years pass and the siblings remain strangers to one another, bound by tragedy and struggling to recover the family they once were. Jules, still adrift, is anchored only by his desires to be a writer and to reunite with Alva, who turned her back on their friendship on the precipice of it becoming more. But, just as it seems they can make amends for time wasted, invisible forces &#x2013; whether fate or chance &#x2013; intervene. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A kaleidoscopic family saga told through the fractured lives of the three Moreau siblings, alongside a faltering, recovering love story, <i>The End of Loneliness</i> is a stunning meditation on the power of our memories, of what can be lost and what can never be let go. With inimitable compassion and luminous, affecting prose, Benedict Wells contends with what it means to find a way through life, while never giving up hope you will find someone to go with you.</p><p>Benedict Wells was born in 1984 in Munich. At the age of six, he started his journey through three Bavarian boarding schools. Upon graduating, he moved to Berlin, where he dedicated his time to writing. In 2016 he won the European Prize for Literature for his third novel,&nbsp;<i>The End of Loneliness</i>, which remained on the German bestseller list for over a year. After years of living in Barcelona, Wells has recently returned to Berlin.&#x201c;A life-affirming work.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Vogue</i> </b><br><br>&#x201c;This beautiful book&#x2014;compact yet flowing, lovingly translated by Charlotte Collins, understated yet passionate&#x2014;brings German author Benedict Wells, only 35, front and center among world writers. It&#x2019;s both a family story and the tale of a man in search of the self he is afraid to own. When you reach the last words and set the book reluctantly down (you don&#x2019;t want to leave the world it has woven), you have suffered and lost again and again, and you are smiling. In the most adult, complex, worldly sense, you&#x2019;re experiencing that rarest of feats, a happy ending.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Superbly crafted<i>. . . .

McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy."</p><p>In <i>The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump</i>, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI's agents, and of the institution's integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution.</p><p>McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI's New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime&#x2015;which is inextricably linked to the Russian state&#x2015;and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.</p><p><i>The Threat</i> recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump's November 2016 election and McCabe's firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI's mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen. </p><p>Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, <i>The Threat</i> tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America.</p></p><p><b>Andrew G. McCabe</b> served as deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from February 2016 to January 2018. He began his career at the FBI in 1996, working first as a street agent on the Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force, and eventually as its supervisor. Later, he led the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, the National Security Branch, and the Washington Field Office, and was the first director of the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, which developed new methods for lawfully and effectively questioning suspected terrorists. He lives in Virginia with his wife Jill, their two children and a dog.<p>"A rapid-fire G-man memoir...The book is patriotic and oddly stirring." - Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Insightful...provocative...McCabe is a keen observer of detail." - <i>The Washington Post</i><br><i></i><br>"McCabe's portrait of the Trump administration and of the president himself is as alarming as any we have seen so far &#x2015; including those of journalists such as Bob Woodward and former staff such as Cliff Sims." - NPR</p><p>"The account is laced with sharp, amusing characterizations...fans of police procedurals will love his descriptions of FBI culture, and critics of the current administration will find his denouncements satisfying.

The point was we&#x2019;d had chest pocket problems in the past, more than once. And possibly more than twice, but I wouldn&#x2019;t know, since I don&#x2019;t count past two. What I do know is that checks have a way of falling out of chest pockets.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he barking about?&#x201d; the lawyer said.<br> <br>Bernie glanced at me. &#x201c;Just wants to get rolling,&#x201d; he said. That wasn&#x2019;t it at all: what I wanted was for Bernie to put that check in his front pants pocket where it would be safe. But then I realized that I did kind of want to get rolling. Wow! That was Bernie, knowing my own mind better than I did. And I knew his exactly the same way! Which is just one of the reasons why the Little Detective Agency is so successful, especially if you forget about the finances part. We&#x2019;re partners. He&#x2019;s Bernie Little. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple.<br> <br>&#x201c;You did a nice job, Bernie,&#x201d; the lawyer said. &#x201c;Those motel pics? Perfecto. Might have another case for you in a couple of weeks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More divorce work?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my beat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie sighed. We hated divorce work, me and Bernie. None of the humans involved were ever at their best, or even close. Get me to tell you sometime about the Teitelbaum divorce and what Mrs. Teitelbaum did at the end, a nightmare except for the fact of that being the night I got my first taste of kosher chicken. There&#x2019;s good in everything.<br> <br>The lawyer had one of those human mouths where the corners turned down. You see that a lot, but not on Bernie: his mouth corners turn up. Now the lawyer&#x2019;s mouth corners turned down some more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you divorced yourself????&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; said Bernie. He has a way of saying &#x201c;so&#x201d; that makes him seem a little bigger, and Bernie&#x2019;s a pretty big guy to begin with.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; the lawyer said. &#x201c;Nothing at all. Just sayin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie gave him a long look. Then he reached for the check and jammed it into one of his front pants pockets. Life is full of surprises, sometimes not so easy to understand. I put this one behind me as fast as I could, my mind shutting down in a very pleasant way.<br> <br><br> <br>We hopped into our ride, a real old Porsche painted different shades of red, but Bernie says I&#x2019;m not good with red, so don&#x2019;t take my word for it.<br> <br>&#x201c;That left a bad taste in my mouth,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;How about a little spin?&#x201d;<br> <br>What was this? Bernie had a bad taste in his mouth? I felt sorry for him. At the same time, I let my tongue roam around my own mouth, and what do you know? Up in the roof part, hidden away in one of those hard ridges? Yes! A Cheeto! Not a whole Cheeto, but pretty close. I nudged it loose with the tip of my tongue and made quick work of it. Riding shotgun in the Porsche, Cheetos practically falling from the sky: we were cooking.<br> <br>Bernie stepped on the pedal, and we roared out of the strip mall lot where the lawyer had his office, the tires shrieking on the hot pavement. Roaring and shrieking: the Porsche had a voice of its own, a voice I loved. We zipped past a lot of strip malls&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve got strip malls out the yingyang here in the Valley&#x2014;and hit the freeway. Freeways we&#x2019;ve also got out the yingyang, all of them packed day and night; this one took us past the downtown towers&#x2014;their tops lost in the brownish sky we sometimes get in monsoon season, a season with a strange damp smell all its own, although there hadn&#x2019;t been a drop of rain yet, not in ages&#x2014;across the big arroyo and up into the hills, traffic thinning at last. Bernie let out a deep breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Think there&#x2019;s anything to that?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Me hating divorce work on account of my own divorce? Some kind of&#x2014;what would you call it? Hidden psychological connection?&#x201d;<br> <br>What was Bernie talking about? I had no clue. I put my paw on his knee, for no particular reason. The car shot forward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Chet! What the hell?&#x201d;<br> <br>Oops. Had I pressed down a bit too hard? I laid off.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, big guy. Sometimes you don&#x2019;t know your own strength.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whoa! Don&#x2019;t know my own strength? Had to be one of Bernie&#x2019;s jokes. He can be a funny guy with jokes&#x2014;take that time he found some pink streamers and stuck them on the handle grips of a bunch of bikes parked outside a biker bar and then waited for the bikers to come out. And that was just the beginning of the fun! But take it from me: I know my own strength.<br> <br>We topped a rise and cruised over a long flat stretch, the highway shimmering blue in the distance like it was covered in water. Not true, as I&#x2019;d learned many times and now was learning again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thirsty, Chet?&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes, all of a sudden. How did he know? Bernie slowed down, dug my bowl out from under the seat, filled it from a water bottle, and set it on the floor in front of me, all of that with one hand on the wheel and sometimes not any. Bernie was the best driver in the Valley. That day he went off the cliff&#x2014;in the Porsche before this one, or maybe before that one, too&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t his fault at all. Once he&#x2019;d even been offered the job of wheelman for the Luddinsky Gang. We&#x2019;d busted them instead. The look on their faces!<br> <br>I stopped panting, leaned down, and lapped up the water.<br> <br>&#x201c;Better?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>Totally. I sat up straight. We rounded a curve and spotted some dudes in orange jumpsuits picking up trash by the roadside, a sheriff&#x2019;s van idling behind them, yellow light flashing. Bernie eased off the gas. We&#x2019;d put a lot of perps into orange jumpsuits, and you never knew when you&#x2019;d bump into an old pal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that Frenchie Boutette?&#x201d;<br> <br>The little roly-poly dude at the end, poking at a scrap of paper, missing, taking a short break? He glanced our way, recognized the car, easy to tell from how his eyebrows shot up. Yes, Frenchie for sure. We pulled over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Frenchie! How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d;<br> <br>Frenchie looked at Bernie, then at me, and backed away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be shy,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to bite you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Think I&#x2019;m fallin&#x2019; for that line again?&#x201d; Frenchie said. &#x201c;Slipped your mind how Chet bit me that last time, down in Arroyo Seco?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Frenchie. How can you call that a bite?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because of all the blood,&#x201d; Frenchie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Barely a scratch,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Booze thins the blood. And why did you try to run away in the first place?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I didn&#x2019;t want to do time. Why else? Like maybe I was training for the Olympics?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie laughed. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t lost your sense of humor.&#x201d;<br> <br>A sheriff&#x2019;s deputy came over, shotgun pointed down, although not completely down. Weapons are something I keep a close eye on.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on here?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just saying that Frenchie hasn&#x2019;t lost his sense of humor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bernie?&#x201d; the deputy said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Waldo,&#x201d; said Bernie. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hundred and seven in the shade and I&#x2019;m out here with the scum of the earth&#x2014;how do you think it&#x2019;s going?&#x201d; Deputy Waldo said, the shotgun now pointed directly at the ground, just the way I like. &#x201c;This Chet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Heard about him.&#x201d; Deputy Waldo gave me a close look. Right away, just from a change in his eyes&#x2014;tiny eyes and pretty cold until this moment&#x2014;I could tell he liked me and my kind. &#x201c;A pretty big dude,&#x201d; Waldo went on. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he weigh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Getting him on the scale&#x2019;s not easy,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>I remembered that game! Bernie tried to pick me up, maybe with some idea of standing with me on the scale. Lots of fun, but no one picks me up, amigo.<br> <br>&#x201c;A hundred plus,&#x201d; Bernie was saying. &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s strong for his size.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got him from the K-9 program?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Basically.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He flunked out&#x2014;was what went down?&#x201d; Waldo said. &#x201c;Hard to believe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A long story,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>And not one I wanted to dwell on at that moment. Flunked out on the very last day, with only the leaping test left, and leaping was my very best thing. The good part was I actually couldn&#x2019;t dwell on it for long, on account of the details growing hazier in my mind every day. I was pretty sure a cat was involved, and maybe some blood&#x2014;but I might have been getting it all mixed up with Frenchie&#x2019;s blood. I&#x2019;d never meant to do Frenchie any harm, just grab him by the pant leg, which was how we usually ended cases at the Little Detective Agency, but Frenchie had strangely chubby calves, and all of a sudden I&#x2019;d found myself . . . best not to go there. Sometimes things happen before you even know it&#x2014;let&#x2019;s leave it at that.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Deputy Waldo was saying, &#x201c;Is he allowed any treats?&#x201d; He handed Bernie the shotgun, fished through his pockets. Allowed? That was a new one on me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t have any dog treats as such,&#x201d; Waldo said. &#x201c;But here&#x2019;s a Slim Jim, kind of a weakness of mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not a whole Slim Jim&#x2014;one end completely chewed off&#x2014;but one thing was clear: Deputy Waldo and I were peas in a pod, although peas, in or out of the pod&#x2014;and I had experience with both kinds&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t do it for me at all. Also I was kind of confused on the weakness part. The very next moment, I was fully occupied, and none of that&#x2014;peas, pods, weaknesses&#x2014;mattered the least little bit.<br> <br>When I tuned back in, Frenchie was talking to Waldo. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t have another one of those hangin&#x2019; around by any chance?&#x201d;<br> <br>Waldo took the shotgun back from Bernie. &#x201c;You askin&#x2019; me for a Slim Jim?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very politely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would I give you a Slim Jim? You&#x2019;re the laziest son of a bitch on the whole goddamn crew.&#x201d; Waldo turned to Bernie. &#x201c;Was he always a lazy son of a bitch, or is this just a special treat for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>My ears perked up at that. More treats? And how could Frenchie be the one to hand them out? There were no pockets in his orange jumpsuit, and he gave off not a whiff of treat, his scent being mostly a not unpleasant mixture of dried sweat, dandruff, and soft butter. Uh-oh, and something else, not good, a dried-up mushroomy smell that our neighbor, old Mrs. Parsons&#x2014;now in the hospital&#x2014;gave off, too, somewhat stronger in her case. Did Frenchie have what Mrs. Parsons had?<br> <br>&#x201c;His talents lie in other directions,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Talent? He&#x2019;s got talent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Frenchie has a head on his shoulders.&#x201d;<br> <br>When they get praised, some humans gaze at the ground and do a foot-shuffling thing. Frenchie did it now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Puttin&#x2019; me on, Bernie?&#x201d; Waldo said.<br> <br>Bernie shook his head. &#x201c;Frenchie came up with this scheme for conning disabled Vietnam vets out of their benefits. One of them was a friend of ours, which was how we got to know Frenchie in the first place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not in for armed robbery?&#x201d; Waldo said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what he tells everybody.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Armed robbery?&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Frenchie Boutette?&#x201d;<br> <br>Waldo turned to Frenchie, the shotgun barrel rising slightly, unsteady in the motionless air. &#x201c;Conning disabled vets? That&#x2019;s despicable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Frenchie raised his hands, plump little hands that reminded me immediately of his calves. I was suddenly very aware of my teeth and not much else. &#x201c;Hardly any of those stup&#x2014;of those heroic vets&#x2014;lost anything worth thinking about. Bernie caught me practically right out of the gate.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie gave Frenchie a hard look. &#x201c;And Chet,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And Chet, of course. Goes without saying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like hearing it said just the same,&#x201d; Bernie told him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t let it happen again,&#x201d; Frenchie said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got nothing but respect for the Little Detective Agency.&#x201d; All at once, Frenchie went still, his eyes blanking in that strange way that means a human&#x2019;s gone deep in his own mind. They do a lot of that, maybe too much. No offense. &#x201c;Bernie?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we, uh, talk for a moment or two?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. We&#x2019;re talking right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Frenchie shot Waldo a sidelong glance and lowered his voice. &#x201c;I mean in private.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay with you, Waldo?&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Frenchie wants to talk to me in private.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Waldo said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the T-Bone Bar and Grill in Dry Springs, not more than fifteen minutes&#x2019; drive from here. Why don&#x2019;t you take Frenchie out for a beer, on me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Frenchie blinked. &#x201c;Dressed like this? I&#x2019;m not sure that&#x2019;s&#x2014;oh.&#x201d; He turned to Bernie. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s foolin&#x2019; with me, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong, Bernie,&#x201d; Waldo said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a moron.&#x201d; Waldo waved the back of his hand at Frenchie and walked away.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;m such a moron,&#x201d; Frenchie said, &#x201c;how come I got fourteen hundred on my SATs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You took the SATs?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Manner of speaking,&#x201d; said Frenchie. &#x201c;My kid brother Ralph took them for me, so it&#x2019;s basically me, DNA-wise. Ralph&#x2019;s what I wanted to talk to you about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking to get him busted for the SAT scam, cut some kind of deal for yourself?&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;My own flesh and blood?&#x201d; Frenchie said, putting his hand over his chest. &#x201c;And even if I could, you know, get past that, the law wouldn&#x2019;t be interested in Ralph. He&#x2019;s a total straight arrow. The SAT caper was the only time in his whole life he even came close to the line. Which is how come I&#x2019;m worried about him now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s crossed the line?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hard to imagine,&#x201d; Frenchie said. &#x201c;But something&#x2019;s wrong for sure. Ralph&#x2019;s gone missing.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Walking Dead: A Continuing Story of Survival Horror, Book 1</h2><p><ul> <li>This hardcover features the first 12 issues of the hit series along with the covers for the issues in one oversized hardcover volume.

He spent long hours in contented silence, solving a huge range of problems, and he was brutally eloquent when dissecting others' psyches. Yet he kept the process of himself to himself. As Barbara Bowerman would recall, "I can't tell you how frustrating it was to love him and trust him, and know he loved me and trusted me, and still he would never tell me what he was thinking."<br><br>To get across what he deemed worth knowing, Bowerman's instrument, blunt or pointed, was the story. So it is to his narrative tales--what they celebrate, what they mock and loathe--that we must look for clues to his character.<br><br>In 1983, the editors of The Wheeler County History asked him to write about his family's founding of the town of Fossil, his boyhood home and the seat of the smallest, poorest county in Eastern Oregon. Bowerman chose to tell the story of his mother's grandfather, James Washington Chambers, who had grown up in Tennessee.<br><br>Along with his parents, Thomas and Letitia, and his four brothers and two sisters, J. W. Chambers lived at The Hermitage, the plantation near Nashville where General Andrew Jackson bred and trained racehorses. Irish- born Letitia Chambers was Jackson's cousin by marriage. The future president and his wife, Rachel, had no children of their own, but they took in family like laundry, turning out one starched, pressed relative after another. Bowerman bled for young J.W., subjected to such bark-bound, puritanical authority: "Being a very much younger brother in a family of Scotch-Irish," Bowerman wrote, "J.W. had plenty of opportunity to vent his rebellion."<br><br>In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected the seventh American president and two years later signed into law the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Henry Clay rightly called the act an eternal stain on the nation's honor, but white settlers cheered and pushed greedily onto tribal lands. By the spring of 1832, the family member hungriest to go was fifteen-year-old J. W. Chambers.<br><br>"What took him," Bowerman asked, "on his quest for the new, the romantic, the dangerous, to what became the Oregon Territory?" Bowerman could only guess, but judging by the words he chose, he must have felt the answer in his bones: "A wild yearning for perfect freedom." One day, young J.W. just up and left, saying (as Bowerman loved to tell the tale), "I'm a-headin' West and just takin' ma pony."<br><br>The Chambers kid's way with horses found him a place among the voyageurs and trappers who mapped the great routes. Every so often a crumpled letter would get back to his family, describing the fish, game, and topsoil beyond the Rockies. Thomas Chambers who had wanted to cross the plains since he'd read Lewis and Clark's journals couldn't rid his dreams of the bounty his son described. By the early 1840s he had moved his family to Morgan County, Missouri, where they began assembling a wagon train.<br><br>In 1844, word of it reached the prodigal son. J.W., then twenty-seven, rode hell-for-leather to Missouri to lead the train, only to find a father who didn't exactly kill the fatted calf in welcome.<br><br>Bowerman put it this way: "As mountain men were wont to do when going to rendezvous, J. W. Chambers joined his buddies in a rip-roaring, trail's-end wingding. The head-of-clan Chambers, exercising Puritan logic, 'splained to J.W. that he was not fit enough nor mature enough to lead the train." To test J.W.'s fitness, Thomas asked whether his son's rebellious habits might accept something short of perfect freedom--namely, the settling influence of a wife. As Bowerman often told it, Thomas had someone specific in mind: "Meet the widow Scoggin," Thomas said. "And her five children. Husband died back East. Needs a man."<br><br>One can imagine the poleaxed J.W. taking a long look at the widow's fiercely bulging eye and hard-set jaw (she did look like Harry Truman) and growling, "By God, I'll do her." They married in 1844, and the Chambers wagon train departed on April 1, 1845, with J.W. riding scout beside his father. And J.W. did her well, for eight months and three weeks later, on the banks of the Willamette, Mary Greene Scoggin Chambers would give birth to Bill Bowerman's grandmother, Mary Jane.<br><br>But first they had to cross two-thirds of a continent. Half a million people traversed the Oregon Trail between 1842 and 1860, a number so vast as to suggest it wasn't all that hard. But it was bitterly hard. Men, women, children, animals, and wagons had to cover ten to fifteen miles a day for eight months or risk having a mountain pass named for them because they froze in it, like the Donners. One in ten died--50,000 in all--far more of them from cholera and accident than at the hands of Indians.<br><br>Almost all those who traveled the Oregon Trail were on the only trip of their lives. They'd sold their farms to outfit their wagons and teams. If they made it to the valley of the Willamette, a married couple was entitled to 640 acres, but meanwhile, that acreage existed only in the haze of carnival-barker promises. The land and friends they'd left behind were heartbreakingly real. It was, as one historian put it, "the experience of giving all to gain all."<br><br>It was a defining ordeal, a winnowing out of the nonindustrious, the nonen- during, the inflexible, the uncooperative. Those who completed the cross- country journey found that it concentrated traits in their new society that would last as long as the wagon tracks themselves, still plain to see today through the sage near Baker City in Eastern Oregon. If Bowerman was stubbornly ingenious, if Bowerman loved to tell a story, if Bowerman gloried in Oregon's vistas and fertility, well, Bowerman was pioneer stock and had a right to cackle, as he did, that "The cowards never started and the weak died along the way."<br><br>The 2,000-mile trek took the Chambers family seven months. On October 15, 1845, their train reached The Dalles, on the Columbia. They were less than a hundred miles from the mouth of the Willamette, but the way was blocked. The basalt cliffs where the Columbia Gorge slices through the Cascades north of Mt. Hood were impassable by wagon, and no flatboats were to be found. The family made their winter quarters about two miles from the Methodist Mission.<br><br>After they had built huts and corrals, Thomas Chambers led an advance party, including J.W. and his gravid wife, Mary, downriver by boat to find their promised land. They selected loamy pastures on the Tualatin River, a tributary of the Willamette, near what would become Hillsboro. They filed Donation Land Claim #41 at the new capital, Oregon City, and it was there, on December 22, 1845, that Mary Jane Chambers was born.<br><br>That winter, J.W. built the first flat-bottomed boat to make it through the Columbia rapids known as Cascade Falls and carried the families' wagons and belongings in a complicated series of ferryings and portages down the Columbia and up the Willamette to their 642-acre homestead on the Tualatin.<br><br>Western Oregon kept its promise. The grass stayed green all winter. The Chamberses were disoriented by the sight of their cows standing fat in the pastures in February. Once the weather cleared in June, the skies were cloudless until October. The Indians had used fire to keep much of the valley in grassland. The settlers' fields produced so much wheat it was soon being used as a means of exchange. They had given all. They had gained all. They were home.<br><br>Not that much peace crept upon the mind of J. W. Chambers.<br><br>In the Willamette Valley, the Chambers family had come to a place with California summers and English winters. The rivers coiling past mistletoe- clotted oaks and dark, befirred hills were swollen by five months of cold rain. The bone-chilling wet that drove Lewis and Clark to clinical depression on the Oregon coast did the same for J.W. He called the Tualatin area a "swamp" and often rode out looking to find better. Indeed, his father, Thomas, and several family members moved to Puget Sound in Washington.<br><br>But the "settling influence," as Bowerman put it, of J.W.'s wife and, eventually, seven children "partially took." For fifteen years, J.W. built warm, dry log homes and barns, helped his neighbors thresh their wheat, and reined in his wanderlust. He made a trip to the gold fields but didn't stay, returning home instead to raise and race his beloved horses. And he used the profits from the farm to order up a spectacular symbol of making it to the new land without sacrificing the refinement of the old: a grand piano for each of his daughters. "They were shipped around Cape Horn before the Panama Canal was built," wrote J.W.'s great-granddaughter Patricia Hoover Frank in 1983. "The girls learned to play them at school. Mary Jane played quite well and sang very well too. She often entertained overnight travelers or guests." (According to Barbara Bowerman, "There's a story that one of J.W.'s horses, named Foster, won $30,000 in a race. I don't know if that's apocryphal, but it would have financed the pianos and considerably more.")<br><br>In 1864, when Mary Jane was eighteen, she accepted the hand of Thomas Benton Hoover, who had been five when he traveled the Trail with his parents in 1844. A photograph from that time shows Mary Jane to be comely and clear-eyed. Many desired her, even to a deranging degree. "The first night in their own home, one of Mary Jane's former suitors set the cabin on fire," wrote Mary Jane's great-granddaughter, Georgia Lee Hoover Stiles. "Obviously they got out, for we are all here."<br><br>Barely. They lost all their belongings--except for the piano, which Tom and Mary Jane somehow managed to drag from the cabin to safety.<br><br>By 1869, the Hoovers had two children, Annie and Will. One day J.W., whom they hadn't seen in a year, burst in and shouted, "Finally, finally, Eden is at hand!" They had heard this before.<br><br>"Horses were J.W.'s life and cattle his cash reward," wrote Bowerman. "His restless spirit was always taking him back across the Cascades." On this trip he'd explored the canyons of a river flowing out of the Blue Mountains. The river was named the John Day, for a hapless man who had been captured and tortured by Indians, escaping with his life but without his sanity.<br><br>It was a cautionary tale, but one totally lost on the old mountain man J.W., now in his early fifties. He rode up the John Day with an Indian friend in 1868, returned in 1869, convened a family council, and said he'd seen over a million acres of rich, black loam and rolling hills. There were lush meadows, virgin timber, abundant springs and creeks. Bowerman liked the line in J.W.'s report that made for an equine heaven: "Shoulder-high in meadow grass, knee-high in bunch grass." Bunch grass endures after meadow hay has frozen. If your hills have clumpy, silvery bunch grass, your stock can last out any winter.<br><br>J.W. had surveyed some ranch-sized claims and ridden for home. Now he asked, who would come across and live with him in a land of milk and honey? The look upon the face of his wife, the formidable Mary Greene Scoggin Chambers, is lost to history, but her reaction isn't: She declined the invitation. "His wife," as Bowerman put it, "figured winning one wilderness home was enough."<br><br>But J.W. talked his daughter Mary Jane, her husband, Tom, stepson Woodson Scoggin, and horse-raising partner William Bigham into joining him in peopling the spreads he'd claimed.<br><br>Their 1870 trek, with covered wagons and livestock, first by boat to The Dalles and then into the interior on Indian trails, took almost three months, lengthened by their lugging along Mary Jane's piano. One wonders, as Bowerman did about J.W. fleeing westward at age fifteen, what made Mary Jane at twenty-four, her children four and two, so uproot her life. If their Tualatin farm was prosperous, it was also by then routine. The family yearning for freedom must have surged in her, too. She was her father's daughter.<br><br>They arrived at a crystal stream in a bowl of greening, juniper-dotted hills on April 26, 1870, named it Hoover Creek, and quickly built four log cabins with floors of whipsawed planks. They turned their animals out into the meadows and planted cottonwoods. From a white cliff, they cut slabs of soft rock that hardened in the air and let them make a fireplace in every dwelling. The mud-caulked cabins (all but one with openings for rifle barrels in case of an Indian attack that never came) were snug, durable, and had room for the piano.<br><br>J.W. wrote in his diary, "This is truly the promised land."<br><br>Sometimes the price of perfect freedom is perfect isolation. Mary Jane wouldn't see another woman settler for two years. When a husband and wife driving their hogs to market sought refuge at Hoover Creek, Stiles continued, "The two women on seeing each other broke down and cried, as they were so starved for friendship. They stayed up all night talking."<br><br>Tom Hoover petitioned for and won a road from The Dalles and settlers filtered in. In 1876, Tom and Mary Jane were sworn in as the area's first postmaster and -mistress and opened an office on their ranch. But what to call it? In their choice, they linked their lonely outpost with concerns greater than bunch grass and hogs. They seem, now and forever, thoroughly modern.<br><br>Not long after they had settled in, they'd heard a rumbling and had run out to see dust rising from the base of a ridge. Tom rode over and found that a landslide had exposed large bones that looked like nothing he'd ever seen. He sent word to a friend, Thomas Condon, who was becoming an eminent geologist. Condon came, looked, was stumped, and packed some off to New York. Eventually the bones proved to be ossified camels and elephants from the Tertiary period, some 60 million years before. Fascinated by the petrified remains and cutting-edge science, the Hoovers named their post office, and later the town, Fossil.<br><br>The connection with Condon was possible because the Chamberses and Hoovers honored learning in a way unusual in such a speck of a frontier town. Each generation of Fossil families sent many of its young away to good colleges. After seeing the wider world, a healthy number returned to keep the ranches thriving. Much of the land today remains in the hands of the original families.<br><br>Was J. W. Chambers, the cause of all the uprooting, satisfied with his new life? It's hard to know. A photo of J.W. in his thirties shows an unfurrowed brow and a coarse, dark beard that can't obscure eyes and mouth brimming with wit. In another image, taken some twenty years later, the beard is white-streaked, the mouth rigid, and the eyes squint beneath a ridge of worry. The photos seem to be of different men.</p><h2>Rumor Has It (An Animal Magnetism Novel)</h2><p><b>An injured soldier returns home and&nbsp;finds a surprising connection with woman from his past in this Animal Magnetism romance.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Special Ops soldier Griffin Reid doesn&#x2019;t exactly have happy memories of growing up in Sunshine, Idaho.

With her phone vibrating from incoming texts&#x2014;which she was doing her best to ignore&#x2014;she shoved her car into park and ran across the lot and into the convenience store. &#x201c;Duct tape?&#x201d; she called out to Meg, the clerk behind the counter.</p><p>Meg had pink and purple tie-dyed hair, had enough piercings to ensure certain drowning if she ever went swimming, and was in the middle of a heated debate on the latest <i>The Voice</i> knock-out rounds with another customer. But she stabbed a finger in the direction of aisle three.</p><p>Kate snatched a roll of duct tape, some twine, and then, because she was also weak, a rack of chocolate mini donuts for later. Halfway to the checkout, a bin of fruit tugged at her good sense so she grabbed an apple. Dumping everything on the counter, she fumbled through her pockets for cash.</p><p>Meg rang her up and bagged her order. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to murder someone, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>Kate choked out a laugh. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Meg took in Kate&#x2019;s appearance. &#x201c;Librarian outfit. Duct tape. Twine. I know you&#x2019;re the math whiz around here, but it all adds up to a <i>Criminal Minds</i> episode to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate was wearing a cardigan, skirt, leggings, and&#x2014;because she&#x2019;d been in a hurry and they&#x2019;d been by the front door&#x2014;snow boots. She supposed with her glasses and hair piled up on her head she might resemble the second-grade teacher that she was, and okay, maybe the snow boots in May were a little suspect. &#x201c;You watch too much TV,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to fry your brain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what fries your brain? Not enough sex.&#x201d; Meg pointed to her phone. &#x201c;Got that little tidbit right off the Internet on my last break.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then it must be true,&#x201d; Kate said.</p><p>Meg laughed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m saying.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate laughed along with her, grabbed her change and her bag, and hurried to the door. She was late. As the grease that ran her family&#x2019;s wheel, she needed to get to her dad&#x2019;s house to help get her little brother, Tommy, ready for school and then to coax the Evil Teen into even going to school. The duct tape run wasn&#x2019;t to facilitate that, or to kill anyone, but to make a camel, of all things, for an afterschool drama project Tommy had forgotten to mention was due today.</p><p>Kate stepped outside and got slapped around by the wind. The month of May had burst onto the scene like a PMSing Mother Nature, leaving the beautiful, rugged Bitterroot Mountains, which loomied high overhead, dusted with last week&#x2019;s surprise snow.</p><p>Spring in Sunshine, Idaho, was MIA.</p><p>Watching her step on the wet, slippery asphalt, she pulled out her once again vibrating phone just to make sure no one was dying. It was a text from her dad and read: Hurry, it&#x2019;s awake.</p><p><i>It</i> being her sister. The other texts were from Ashley herself. She was upset because she couldn&#x2019;t find her cheerleading top, and also, did Kate know that Tommy was talking to his invisible friend in the bathroom again?</p><p>Kate sighed and closed her eyes for a brief second, which was all it took for her snow boots to slip. She went down like a sack of cement, her phone flying one way, her bag the other as she hit the ground butt first with teeth-jarring impact.</p><p>&#x201c;Dammit!&#x201d; She took a second for inventory&#x2014;no massive injuries. That this was in thanks to not having lost those five pounds of winter brownie blues didn&#x2019;t make her feel any better. The cold seeped through her tights and the sidewalk abraded the bare skin of her palms. Rolling to her hands and knees, she reached for her keys just as a set of denim-clad legs came into her field of vision.</p><p>The owner of the legs crouched down, easily balancing on the balls of his feet. A hand appeared, her keys centered in the big palm. Tilting her head up, she froze.</p><p>Her polite stranger wore a baseball cap low over his eyes, shadowing most of his face and dark hair, but she&#x2019;d know those gunmetal gray eyes anywhere. And then there was the rest of him. Six foot two and built for trouble in army camo cargoes, a black sweatshirt, and his usual badass attitude, the one that tended to have men backing off and women checking for drool; there was no mistaking Griffin Reid, the first guy she&#x2019;d ever fallen for. Of course she&#x2019;d been ten at the time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;That was a pretty spectacular fall,&#x201d; he said, blocking her from standing up. &#x201c;Make sure you&#x2019;re okay.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Keep your cool</i>, she told herself. <i>Don&#x2019;t speak, just nod.</i> But her mouth didn&#x2019;t get the memo. &#x201c;No worries, a man&#x2019;s forty-seven percent more likely to die from a fall than a woman.&#x201d; The minute the words escaped, she bit her tongue, but of course it was too late. When she got nervous, she spouted inane science facts.</p><p>And Griffin Reid made her very nervous.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask you again,&#x201d; he said, moving his tall, linebacker body nary an inch as he pinned her in place with nothing more than his steady gaze. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Actually, no, she wasn&#x2019;t. Not even close. Her pride was cracked, and quite possibly her butt as well, but that wasn&#x2019;t what had her kneeling there on the ground in stunned shock. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled grimly. &#x201c;I was ordered back by threat of bodily harm if I was late to the wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>He was kidding. No one ordered the tough, stoic badass Griffin to do anything, except maybe Uncle Sam since he was some secret army demolitions expert who&#x2019;d been in Afghanistan for three straight tours. But his sister, Holly, was getting married this weekend. And if there was anyone more bossy or determined than Griffin, it was his baby sister. Only Holly could get her reticent brother halfway around the world for her vows.</p><p>Kate had told herself that as Holly&#x2019;s best friend and maid of honor, she would absolutely not drool over Griffin if he showed up. And she would especially not make a fool of herself.</p><p>Too late, on both counts.</p><p>Again she attempted to get up, but Griffin put a big, tanned, work-roughened hand on her thigh, and she felt herself tingle.</p><p>Well, damn. Meg was right&#x2014;too little sex fried the brain.</p><p>Clearly misunderstanding her body&#x2019;s response, Griffin squeezed gently as if trying to soothe, which of course had the opposite effect, making things worse. Embarrassed, she tried to pull free, but still effortlessly holding her, Griffin&#x2019;s steely gray eyes remained steady on hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Take stock first,&#x201d; he said, voice low but commanding. &#x201c;What hurts? Let me see.&#x201d;</p><p>Since the only thing that hurt besides her pride was a part of her anatomy that she considered No Man&#x2019;s Land, hell would freeze over before she&#x2019;d &#x201c;let him see.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Really,&#x201d; she added.</p><p>Griffin took her hand and easily hoisted her up, studying her in that assessing way of his. Then he started to turn her around, presumably to get a three-hundred-and-sixty degree view, but she stood firm. &#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; she said, backing away, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good.&#x201d; And if she weren&#x2019;t, if she&#x2019;d actually broken her butt, she&#x2019;d die before admitting it, so it didn&#x2019;t matter. Bending to gather up her belongings, she carefully sucked in her grimace of pain.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it,&#x201d; Griffin said, and scooped up the duct tape and donuts. He looked like maybe he was going to say something about the donuts, but at the odd vibrating noise behind them, he turned. &#x201c;Your phone&#x2019;s having a seizure,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Panicked siblings, no doubt. After all, there was a camel to create out of thin air and a cheerleading top to locate, and God only knew what disaster her father was coming up with for breakfast.</p><p>Griffin offered the cell phone, and Kate stared down at it thinking how much easier her day would go if it had smashed to pieces when it hit the ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Want me to step on it a few times?&#x201d; he asked, sounding amused. &#x201c;Kick it around?&#x201d;</p><p>Startled that he&#x2019;d read her so easily, she snatched the phone. When her fingers brushed his, an electric current sang up her arms and went straight to her happy spots without passing Go. Ignoring them, she turned to her fallen purse. Of course the contents had scattered. And of course the things that had fallen out were a tampon and condom.</p><p>It was how her day was going.</p><p>She began cramming things back into the purse, the phone, the donuts, the duct tape, the condom, and the tampon.</p><p>The condom fell back out.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d; Griffin&#x2019;s mouth twitched as he tossed it into her purse for her. &#x201c;Duct tape and a Trojan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Big plans for the day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Trojans built protective walls around their city,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Like condoms. That&#x2019;s where the name Trojan comes from.&#x201d;</p><p>His mouth twitched. &#x201c;Gotta love those Trojans. Do you carry the condom around just to give people a history lesson?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I&#x2014;&#x201d; He was laughing at her. Why was she acting like such an idiot? She was a teacher, a good one, who bossed around seven- and eight-year-olds all day long. She was in charge, and she ran her entire world with happy confidence.</p><p>Except for this with Griffin. Except for anything with Griffin.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Little Katie Evans, all grown up and carrying condoms.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Only one condom.&#x201d; It was her emergency, wishful-thinking condom. &#x201c;And I go by Kate now.&#x201d;</p><p>He knew damn well she went by Kate and had ever since she&#x2019;d hit her teens. He just enjoyed saying &#x201c;Little Katie Evans&#x201d; like it was all one word, as if she were still that silly girl who&#x2019;d tattled on him for putting the frogs in the pond at one of his mom&#x2019;s elegant luncheons, getting him grounded for a month.</p><p>Or the girl who, along with his nosy sister, Holly, had found his porn stash under his bed at the ranch house and gotten him grounded for two months.</p><p>&#x201c;Kate,&#x201d; he said as if testing it out on his tongue, and she had no business melting at his voice. None. Her only excuse was that she hadn&#x2019;t seen him much in the past few years. There&#x2019;d been a few short visits, a little Facebook interaction, and the occasional Skype conversation if she happened to be with Holly when he called home. Those had always been with him in uniform on Holly&#x2019;s computer, looking big, bad, and distracted.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t in uniform now, but she could check off the big, bad, and distracted. The early gray dawn wasn&#x2019;t doing her any favors, but he could look good under any circumstances. Even with his baseball hat, she could see that his dark hair was growing out, emphasizing his stone eyes and hard jaw covered with a five-o&#x2019;clock shadow. To say that he looked good was like saying the sun might be a tad bit warm on its surface. How she&#x2019;d forgotten the physical impact he exuded in person was beyond her. He was solid, sexy male to the core.</p><p>His gaze took her in as well, her now windblown hair and mud-spattered leggings stuffed into snow boots&#x2014;she wasn&#x2019;t exactly at her best this morning. When he stepped back to go, embarrassment squeezed deep in her gut. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she said, gesturing over her shoulder in the vague direction of her car. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gotta go, too&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But Grif wasn&#x2019;t leaving; he was bending over and picking up some change. &#x201c;From your purse,&#x201d; he said, and dropped it into her hand.</p><p>She looked down at the two quarters and a dime, and then into his face. She&#x2019;d dreamed of that face. Fantasized about it. &#x201c;There are 293 ways to make change for a dollar,&#x201d; she said before she could bite her tongue. Dammit. She collected bachelor of science degrees. She was smart. She was good at her job. She was happy.</p><p>And ridiculously male challenged&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Griffin gave a playful tug on an escaped strand of her hair. &#x201c;You never disappoint,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good to see you again.&#x201d;</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>Five minutes later Kate pulled up to her dad&#x2019;s place. One glance in the rearview mirror at her still flushed cheeks and bright eyes told her that she hadn&#x2019;t gotten over her tumble in the parking lot.</p><p>Or the run-in with Griffin.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re ridiculous,&#x201d; she told her reflection. &#x201c;You are not still crushing on him.&#x201d;</p><p>But she so was.</p><p>With a sigh, she reached for the weekly stack of casserole dishes she&#x2019;d made to get her family through the week without anyone having to actually be in charge. She got out of her car, leaving the keys in it for Ashley, who&#x2019;d drive it to her private high school just outside of town.</p><p>Tommy stood in the doorway waiting. He wore a green hoodie and had a fake bow and arrow set slung over his chest and shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you all red in the face?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Are you sick?&#x201d;</p><p>She touched her still burning cheeks. The Griffin Reid Effect, she supposed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold out here this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>The seven-year-old accepted this without question. &#x201c;Did you get the tape?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Tommy&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Tommy. I&#x2019;m the Green Arrow.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;Green Arrow. Yes, I got the tape, Green Arrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see how duct tape is going to help us make a camel,&#x201d; he said, trailing her into the mudroom.</p><p>She refrained from telling him the biggest aid in making a camel for the school play would&#x2019;ve been to give her more warning than a panicked five A.M. phone call. Instead she set down the casserole dishes on the bench to shrug out of her sweater as she eyed him. She could tell he&#x2019;d done as she&#x2019;d asked and taken a shower, because his dark hair was wet and flattened to his head, emphasizing his huge brown eyes and pale face. &#x201c;Did you use soap and shampoo?&#x201d;</p><p>He grimaced and turned to presumably rectify the situation, dragging his feet like she&#x2019;d sent him to the guillotine.</p><p>Kate caught him by the back of his sweatshirt. &#x201c;Tonight&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; she said, picking back up the casseroles and stepping into the living room.</p><p>Evidence of the second-grade boy and the high school&#x2013;junior girl living here was all over the place. Abandoned shoes were scattered on the floor; sweatshirts and books and various sporting equipment lay on furniture.</p><p>Her dad was in the midst of the chaos, sitting on the couch squinting at his laptop. Eddie Evans was rumpled, his glasses perched on top of his head. His khakis were worn and frayed at the edges. His feet were bare. He looked like Harry Potter at age fifty. &#x201c;Stock&#x2019;s down again,&#x201d; he said, and sighed.</p><p>Since he said the same thing every morning, Kate moved into the kitchen. No breakfast. She went straight to the coffeemaker and got that going. Ten minutes later her dad wandered in. &#x201c;You hid them again,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She handed him a cup of coffee and a plate of scrambled egg whites and wheat toast before going back to wielding the duct tape to create the damn camel. &#x201c;You know what the doctor said. You can&#x2019;t have them.&#x201d;</p><p>His mouth tightened. &#x201c;I need them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad, I know it&#x2019;s hard,&#x201d; she said softly, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve been so strong.

Now, inspired by her fans and enraged by how little in our culture has changed since her groundbreaking novel <i>Speak</i> was first published twenty years ago, she has written a poetry memoir that is as vulnerable as it is rallying, as timely as it is timeless. In free verse, Anderson shares reflections, rants, and calls to action woven between deeply personal stories from her life that she's never written about before. Described as "powerful," "captivating," and "essential" in the nine starred reviews it's received, this must-read memoir is being hailed as one of 2019's best books for teens and adults. A denouncement of our society's failures and a love letter to all the people with the courage to say #MeToo and #TimesUp, whether aloud, online, or only in their own hearts, <i>SHOUT</i> speaks truth to power in a loud, clear voice-- and once you hear it, it is impossible to ignore.</p><p>Laurie Halse Anderson is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author whose writing spans young readers, teens, and new adults. Combined, her books have sold more than eight million copies. She has been twice nominated for the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award. Two of her books, <i>Speak</i> and <i>Chains</i>, were National Book Award finalists, and <i>Chains</i> was short-listed for the prestigious Carnegie Medal. Laurie was selected by the American Library Association for the 2009 Margaret A. Edwards Award and has been honored for her battles for intellectual freedom by the National Coalition Against Censorship and the National Council of Teachers of English.<br><br> In addition to combating censorship, Laurie regularly speaks about the need for diversity in publishing and is a member of RAINN&#x2019;s National Leadership Council.

Addressed to high and low they were so prized by the recipients that the first collection by Robert McWard appeared in 1664 just three years after Rutherford's death. the successive editions contained more letters until they grew to the 365 in Andrew Bonar's classic edition. <br> From this, 'the most remarkable series of devotional letters that the literature of the Reformed churches can show', the great leaders in the Church as well as the humblest Christians have drawn strength. It is said of Robert Murray M'Cheyne that 'the Letters of Samuel Rutherford were often in his hand.' This abridged edition contains sixty-nine of these letters.</p><p>Samuel Rutherford (1600 61) was born in the village of Nisbet, Roxburghshire, and educated at Jedburgh Grammar School and Edinburgh University (MA, 1621). From 1623 he acted as Regent of Humanity at the University, with responsibilities as a Latin tutor. There is a strong suggestion that 1624 was the date of his conversion, and he began reading theology at Edinburgh under Andrew Ramsay.<br>In 1627 he was settled as minister of Anwoth in Kirkcudbrightshire, and so began a ministry lasting only nine years, yet one 'whose fragrance and power has left the name of Anwoth forever stamped on the hearts of Christian people'. In July 1636 the High Commission brought his ministry in Anwoth to an end because of his nonconformity, barring him from preaching in Scotland and exiling him to Aberdeen for the duration of the King's pleasure. It was during his two years in Aberdeen that many of his much-loved Letters were written.'When we are dead and gone let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford's letters to be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men.' --<i>C.H. Spurgeon</i><br><br>'Surprising though it may seem in a world of large books, of all those owned by our family this may be the one we have most often lent or quoted to friends.' --<i>Sinclair B.

In <em>The Creedal Imperative</em>, Carl Trueman wisely applies his vast historical knowledge to offer a remedy for such deficiencies. This book is especially important for so many believers whose Christian life, like mine, grew out of the soil of vibrant experience with insufficient doctrinal moorings. And beyond merely correcting errors, the lessons here have great potential for protecting the church, reinvigorating our cherished beliefs, and fostering greater unity in our worship.

Mahaney</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville</p><p>&#x201c;It is commonplace among many church leaders to dispute the need for confessions of faith on the grounds of the supreme authority of the Bible. In this timely book, Trueman demonstrates effectively how such claims are untenable. We all have creeds&#x2015;the Bible itself requires them&#x2015;but some are unwritten, not open to public accountability, and the consequences can be damaging. Trueman&#x2019;s case deserves the widest possible hearing.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert Letham</strong><strong>,</strong> Director of Research and Senior Lecturer in Systematic and Historical Theology, Wales Evangelical School of Theology; author, <em>The Holy Trinity</em> and <em>Union with Christ</em></p><p>&#x201c;Herein is a truly inspiring vision, that churches be freed from the vapid, the fickle, and the dysfunctional by a deeper enjoyment of the faith we have received.

He manages to demonstrate the relevance of creeds by showing how new the old ones are. The book is not only a must-read for those who stick to creeds without knowing why or those whose creed it is to have no creed, but for everyone who tries to practice the Christian faith.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Herman Selderhuis</strong><strong>,</strong> Director, Refo500; Professor and Director of the Institute for Reformation Research, Theological University Apeldoorn, the Netherlands; author, <em>Calvin&#x2019;s Theology of the Psalms</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is an engrossing survey, sparklingly contemporary yet eruditely historical.

His arguments are wide-ranging and include biblical exposition, lessons from church history, and modern cultural factors that may be unconsciously influencing one&#x2019;s view of the issue. In addition, there is the typical Trueman humor and odd examples sprinkled throughout the book. In the end, I agree with him and will require this book for my seminary course on creeds.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert J.

In <em>The Creedal Imperative</em>, Carl Trueman demonstrates that he is not only able to teach the Word and how it has come down to us throughout history, but also how to do so with kindness, patience, and gentleness&#x2015;precisely the qualities that are needed to convince in our creedless, ahistorical, and shallow age. As one whose entire ministry of preaching, teaching, and writing has been taken up with the Word as confessed in the great creeds and confessions of Christendom, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Daniel R.

Trueman demonstrates how creeds and confessions are strategic checkpoints, intended not only to enable us to express our beliefs, but also to keep us from misunderstanding God&#x2019;s truth. Properly used, creeds and confessions, under the authority of God&#x2019;s Word, enable us to hear God&#x2019;s voice&#x2015;they are our speaking what we understand God has spoken to us in Scripture. For those who maintain, &#x2018;We have no creed or confession but the Bible,&#x2019; this book is a must-read. For those who understand the place of creeds and confessions in the life of Christian faith, this book is also a must-read. It is all about understanding God&#x2019;s truth. I commend Trueman for his careful demonstration of clear exegesis, sound theology, understanding of church history, and, consequently, his ability to understand the times in which we live.

Carl Trueman&#x2019;s case for what he terms &#x2018;the creedal imperative&#x2019; of the Christian faith is spot-on. Trueman not only identifies but also deftly rebuts a number of traditional as well as more recent objections in contemporary culture to creeds and confessions. On the one hand, he shows the untenability of the &#x2018;no creed but Christ, no book but the Bible&#x2019; position of many evangelical Christians. And on the other hand, he defends the use of creeds and confessions that summarize and defend the teaching of Scripture without supplementing Scripture or diminishing its authority.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Cornelis P.

In <i>How to Stop Acting</i>, Guskin reveals the insights and techniques that have worked wonders for beginners as well as stars. Instead of yet another "method," Guskin offers a strategy based on a radically simple and refreshing idea: that the actor's work is not to "create a character" but rather to be continually, personally responsive to the text, wherever his impulse takes him, from first read-through to final performance. From this credo derives an entirely new perspective on auditioning and the challenge of developing a role and keeping it fresh, even over hundreds of performances. Drawing on examples from his clients' work and his own, Guskin presents acting as a constantly evolving exploration rather than as a progression toward a fixed goal. He also offers sound and original advice on adapting to the particular demands of television and film, playing difficult emotional scenes, tackling the Shakespearean and other great roles, and more. His book will find an eager and appreciative audience among novices and established actors alike.</p></p><p><p><b>Harold Guskin</b> has worked with dozens of stage and screen actors and is himself an actor and director. He lives in New York City with his wife, the playwright and screenwriter Sandra Jennings.</p>How to Stop Acting <br> 1 TAKING IT OFF THE PAGE <i>"I'm basically a shy person, and I can get as shy in front of a character that I have been hired to inhabit as I can in front of an actual breathing human being. A lot of what we worked on when we first got together was getting through my shyness in relationship to the character whose words had to come out of my mouth."</i> &nbsp; <br> --Glenn Close &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Actors come to me for all sorts of reasons, at every stage of their careers. Matt Dillon came to me for the first time with a stack of research he'd done for his role in <i>Drugstore Cowboy.</i> Christopher Reeve came at a low point, showing the courage to rediscover himself in his work. James Gandolfini continued to examine Tony Soprano with me in <i>The Sopranos'</i> second and third seasons, after a hugely successful first year. Glenn Close came because of a problem with auditioning. Glenn says: You have to force yourself to get through that barrier of shyness--to force the words out, to speak them--so you can slowly start getting beyond that and into the character. That kind of training has stood me in great stead. You find yourself on a movie set doing a scene and you know you're not there. At that moment,I have learned to say, "Don't lose courage. Just keep leaping out there. Be able to make a fool of yourself." And because you've not gotten frightened, and you haven't retreated from the moment, if you persevere, you'll find it. I think those early days of me sitting in your living room and forcing myself to say words that I had no idea how to say--getting them out, flinging them out, throwing them out--was like breaking some sort of sound barrier, giving me freedom on the other side. In the conventional view, the actor's work on the character begins with his reading the script for himself and then talking about the character and text with the director. The problem with this approach is that from the beginning of the process it places the actor outside the script, and outside the character. And being outside the script and the character means that the actor is fundamentally <i>outside himself</i>--outside of the instinct, feelings, imagination, and fantasy life necessary to conceive the character creatively. He may arrive at an extremely sophisticated understanding of the character that nevertheless leaves him utterly confused about how to put his analysis into action. That is because reading the script is an intellectual process that inevitably leads the actor to approach both character and script as we have been taught in school--in an analytical way. Whether it's Stanislavskian analysis or some sort of literary analysis, it leads the actor to <i>think</i> about the character rather than instinctively to try out different possibilities for the character. In fact, analysis tends to make the actor afraid of trusting his instinct. It leads to doubts about whether his mind is crisp enough to grasp quickly enough the character's central needs in life or his desires in a particular scene, as Stanislavski instructs. Analysis weakens the actor. Glenn Close, one of the most intelligent actors I know, told me, "I don't pride myself on being able to read a script really well.There are some people who can sit down and really analyze it and get its full value immediately, but it takes me a while." Analysis is not really what actors are good at, although most really good actors are quite smart. It should be left to literary scholars and critics. Actors are about feelings, imagination, and improvisation. They are good at becoming other people. Their instinct is their talent. The more they trust their instinct, the more inspired and inspiring their performances become. That is when they surprise us, even startle us. That is what the audience goes to see. It's not that intellect is unimportant. It's just not where the actor's work starts. <i>I believe that it's not until the actor is actually verbalizing the words of the character that his real work in acting begins.</i> No matter how experienced or inexperienced he is, the most important thing for him to do is to connect himself to the text--to the dialogue, to the words. At that moment, he has connected himself to the character in a real way--even a physical way, as the words come out of his mouth. If he is able truly to speak the character's dialogue, rather than to read or recite it, he is in fact inside the character's head. He will feel free with the dialogue and the choices it provokes. His fear of finding the character will diminish. If he can be in the moment, in the script, and in himself at the same time--floating with the line--his instincts and the script will take him where he needs to go. If the actor can connect in a personal and instinctive way to the words his character speaks, moment by moment, at the very outset of his work, then he will begin his exploration from <i>within the character</i>. The actor has to start from his visceral response to the material. This is why he must reject intellectual choices at the beginning of his work. He must allow himself to be in an exploratory state, unsure of what he is going to do; this forces him to trust his initial responses to the dialogue, regardless of how absurd or contrary they may seem. If he is analytical, his intellect will stifle these reactions. But the moment when the words must come out of the actor's mouth is always the most fearful, as Glenn Close so vividly describes. It's the ultimate showdown. And because it is so daunting, the actor does what he can to avoid or postpone it, even when he says the words aloud. Each time he picks up a new script and starts to read it out loud, he is tempted to "make it real." By <i>real,</i> he inevitably means conversational or natural or casual. If the actor is a quick study and what is considered in the business a "good reader," he will make the dialogue sound as if it's real even while he has his nose buried in the text. That seems like the smart thing to do. The problem is, it's a useless thing to do because the actor is approximating, no matter how deftly, a realistic line reading--that is, how the dialogue <i>might</i> go. And in the process, he is establishing rhythms and choices he doesn't even know he wants. He's imitating the way he thinks it <i>should</i> go, and before long he may find himself stuck in those line readings and those choices without being aware of it. At best, he'll have to break the pattern in order to feel free and to find fresh responses, real responses. When an actor comes to work with me, I want real, fresh responses from the beginning. So whether he's a seasoned actor taking on his umpteenth major role, or a young actor just starting out, we begin the same way. We go back to the barre, like a ballet dancer, starting from zero with a simple but effective exercise that allows the actor to discover or rediscover the foundation of acting through the text, with no preconceptions of how to play the role. I call this process <i>taking it off the page</i>. Here's how it works: The actor looks down at the phrase and breathes in and out while he reads the words to himself, giving himself time to let the phrase into his head. Then he looks up from the page and says the line, no longer reading but speaking. Taking your time to breathe in and out while you look down atthe page to read the phrase for yourself allows you to access whatever unconscious thoughts or images it evokes. It doesn't matter what comes up--however trivial, simple, deep, or apparently unrelated it is--as long as it is your actual response at the time, and not what you <i>think</i> is appropriate. The point is to let the dialogue bounce around in your unconscious, a bit like in the Freudian concept of word association in which the psychoanalyst says a word and the patient responds with whatever word comes to mind, before he can censor it. The actor is accessing his unconscious self, surprising himself with his unconscious response, in much the same way. As soon as you exhale, say the phrase before you have a chance to censor whatever thought or feeling surfaces. Don't deaden the line by trying to be sincere. Just say what you mean, no matter how startling, stupid, frightening, funny, touching, irreverent, or boring. Exhaling before you speak ensures that it is your own voice that you are using, not a phony, artificially projected actor's voice. It is the way we all speak when we are not acting. Once the feeling has surfaced and been expressed, feel free to drop it so that the next line can take you to a new place. Actors often hold on to a feeling or thought that's working, out of fear that they'll have nothing else to replace it that will be as good. But the truth is, holding on to the thought or feeling evoked by one line limits the possible range of responses the next line can elicit; letting go leaves room for something new to arise. That's what exploration is all about. Often actors are afraid they won't have a feeling for the writer's line. And sometimes the honest response to a line is, I don't feel or think anything. If so, that's what you must say--with the writer's words. Surprisingly, that response is as good and useful as any other. That's because it is a truthful response. In real life, we often don't know what we feel or think, or whether we have a responseat all. It takes courage to admit to yourself that you don't really have any feelings about something. Even more courage is needed to avoid manufacturing a false feeling to please those around you. This admission is not only important, it's essential! <i>Nothing</i> is powerful when admitted in front of an audience or a camera. Doing nothing puts the audience on notice that the person in front of us is real. I am not manufacturing feelings and thoughts because it's expected of me, he is saying. His <i>no-response</i> makes him more dangerous, unsocialized, surprising. We don't know what he may do next. This makes the actor interesting. One of the reasons people love James Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony Soprano is that it's filled with a lot of unusual responses and unexpected choices. People often assume this comes from a process of breaking down the script and selecting from among his responses in advance. But in fact, when I work with Jim, often the most important thing he does is to admit that he doesn't know what he feels about a scene or a moment. By accepting this and allowing himself to do nothing, he is making himself available to the surprising and unpredictable responses that follow. The beginning actor will also discover that if he has no feeling one moment, he will find himself angry or frustrated or saddened or amused the next moment. And it will probably be a big feeling. An actor doing nothing is doing a great deal. Think of the end of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>. Ma Joad asks Tom, "But Tommy--how will I know where you are?" And Henry Fonda (as Tom) answers, "Wherever there are cops beating on fellas, I'll be there, Ma ..." Recalling this classic moment, Peter Fonda told me, "My father stayed with his Nebraska cadence. He hardly blinked and he just read the words as simple and flat and straight as it could be. Thinking back on it, had he put any dramatic spin on it, facial or verbal or tonal, those words would have been the corniest words in the world." Doing this--doing nothing--allowed the truth of that moment to emerge powerfully. Don't get too exacting about how much text to take off the page at a time. You may pick up a phrase or a whole line or even a couple of short lines at once. Do whatever your instinct tells you, or choose arbitrarily. In fact, breaking the normal rhythms of your speech can make you more open to characters with different, new, and unexpected rhythms. But what matters most is that you say what you mean, whatever that is. Most important of all, <i>don't be careful!</i> These are your lines, your images, your thoughts. Don't think of taking it off the page as a technique so much as a commonsense way to start your work. The exploration you are beginning is going to become the character. Because you are within the script, anything you do could be or could become the character. You are in a state of discovery triggered by the only thing we know for sure about the character--what the character says. This leaves you free to try anything that comes to you. Let me show you how taking it off the page works in practice. Suppose I am starting my work on Michael Weller's play <i>Loose Ends</i>, in the role of Paul. The play opens with the monologue on the following page. The first line is, "It was great at the beginning." I look down at the page and read the line to myself while taking a breath in and out. At another time, or for another actor, it might conjure up, say, the beginning of a relationship that has since broken up, but right now it evokes in me the memory of directing my first play as a graduate student, with Kevin Kline and the Vest Pocket Players. We were so young and everything was ahead of us. I look up from the page and say the line, relishing the memory. If I trust myself, I won't have to do anything but say the line, and my response will be visible. I won't have to add anything. Noone will know the specifics of what I'm thinking, because I say only the line Weller wrote. But if I trust myself to <i>just say it</i>, the line will be full. Most actors don't trust themselves to just say it, however. They don't trust that what they are thinking or feeling is enough. They want to <i>do something</i> with the line. They want to show us their thought or feeling. From <i>Loose Ends</i> by Michael Weller ( <i>Five Plays</i>. New York: New American Library, 1982.) &nbsp; <br> SCENE 1 Slide: 1970. A beach. Night. Full moon. Waves. On bare stage, Paul and Susan, early to mid-20's, naked, clothes around. He sits facing ocean (us) and she lies curled up. &nbsp; <br> PAUL. It was great at the beginning. I could speak the language almost fluently after a month and the people were fantastic. They'd come out and help us. Teach us songs. Man, we thought it was all going so well. But we got all the outhouses dug in six months and we had to stay there two years, that was the deal. And that's when we began to realize that none of the Nglele were using the outhouses. We'd ask them why and they'd just shrug. So we started watching them very carefully and what we found out was the Nglele use their feces for fertilizer. It's like gold to them. They thought we were all fucking crazy expecting them to waste their precious turds in our spiffy new outhouses. Turns out they'd been helping us because they misunderstood why we were there. They thought it was some kind of punishment and we'd be allowed to go home after we finished digging the latrines, that's why they were helping us and then when we stayed on they figured we must be permanent outcasts or something and they just stopped talking to us altogether. I want the actor to say what he means at that moment, with as little fuss as possible. He must let the line of the character become his own line, in a completely personal way, so he is not acting it.He must forget about the author's intention at first, because the actor doesn't know who the character is at this point, or what the author really wants. The actor is responsible only for what the line means to him right now, and what it creates in him. And so he must say only what he means, without embellishing it or fixing it up. I look down and take another breath in and out while reading the next phrase: "I could speak the language almost fluently." I don't force myself to read the whole line. I let...</p><h2>Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Walter Mosley introduces an "astonishing character" <i>(Los Angeles Times Book Review)</i> in this acclaimed collection of entwined tales. Meet Socrates Fortlow, a tough ex-con seeking truth and redemption in South Central Los Angeles -- and finding the miracle of survival. <br> <i>"I either committed a crime or had a crime done to me every day I was in jail. Once you go to prison you belong there."</i> Socrates Fortlow has done his time: twenty-seven years for murder and rape, acts forged by his huge, rock-breaking hands. Now, he has come home to a new kind of prison: two battered rooms in an abandoned building in Watts. Working for the Bounty supermarket, and moving perilously close to invisibility, it is Socrates who throws a lifeline to a drowning man: young Darryl, whose shaky path is already bloodstained and fearsome. In a place of violence and hopelessness, Socrates offers up his own battle-scarred wisdom that can turn the world around.</p><p>In this cycle of 14 bittersweet stories, Walter Mosley breaks out of the genre--if not the setting--of his bestselling Easy Rawlins detective novels. Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate, scavenges for bottles, drinks, and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless rage--as well as the power of his massive "rock-breaking" hands--Socrates must find a way to live an honorable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a task which takes every ounce of self-control he has. <p> Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the chaos, poverty, and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighborhood crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both musical and hard-edged, resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear, and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral vision.</p>Walter Mosley is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of five Easy Rawlins mysteries: <i>Devil in A Blue Dress</i>, <i>A Red Death</i>, <i>White Butterfly</i>, <i>Black Betty,</i> and <i>A Little Yellow Dog</i>; three non-mystery novels, <i>Blue Light</i>, <i>Gone Fishin'</i>, and <i>R. L.'s Dream</i>; two collections of stories featuring Socrates Fortlow, <i>Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned</i>, for which he received the Anisfield Wolf Award, and which was an HBO movie; and a nonfiction book, <i>Workin' On The Chain Gang</i>. Mosley is also the author of the Leonid McGill, and Fearless Jones mystery series, <i>The Tempest Tales</i> and <i>Six Easy Pieces</i>. He is a former president of the Mystery Writers of America, a founder of the PEN American Center Open Book Committee, and is on the board of directors of the National Book Awards.

Now Anderson shares this wisdom-and offers an incomparable perspective on the questions faced in day-to-day life.</p><p>Someday we will return to a place of unfathomable beauty, where we live amongst all the beings we have ever loved, promises George Anderson author of <i>Walking in the Garden of Souls</i>. "It is a place we will see again only after our lifetime of struggle, hardship and hurt has earned us the reward of true and final peace." Our task is not to simply muddle through, waiting for our ticket to Eden, cautions Anderson. Rather, we must set out to create "a Garden on earth while we are here," meaning we must cultivate the same life we yearn for in the hereafter. As he did with <i>Lessons from the Light</i>, Anderson conveys messages from the departed to help us tend our garden. The advice ranges from how to plant hope in times of despair to how to water the seeds of compassion (it may start with placing money in a panhandler's palm). Sometimes the garden metaphor seems forced or clich�d. But overall, this is a book with honorable intentions, helping us understand the purpose of life on Earth. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>George Anderson not only works in the United States conducting seminars, lectures, and private appointments, but has also found wide appeal in Europe, Asia, and South Africa.

He has just retired as Professor of Science Writing at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts and now lives in Baltimore.This moving and astonishing biography tells the improbable story of India-born Srinavasa Ramanujan Iyengar, self-taught mathematical prodigy. In 1913 Ramanujan, a 25-year-old clerk who had flunked out of two colleges, wrote a letter filled with startlingly original theorems to eminent English mathematician G. H. Hardy. Struck by the Indian's genius, Hardy, member of the Cambridge Apostles and an obsessive cricket aficionado, brought Ramanujan to England. Over the next five years, the vegetarian Brahmin who claimed his discoveries were revealed to him by a Hindu goddess turned out influential mathematical propositions. Cut off from his young Indian wife left at home and emotionally neglected by fatherly yet aloof Hardy, Ramanujan returned to India in 1919, depressed, sullen and quarrelsome; he died one year later of tuberculosis. Kanigel ( Apprentice to Genius ) gives nontechnical readers the flavor of how Ramanujan arrived at his mathematical ideas, which are used today in cosmology and computer science.

In Jewish spaces, she was mistaken for the help, asked to leave, or worse. Even in her own extended family, racism bubbled to the surface.<br><br> Marra&#x2019;s family cut out those relatives who could not tolerate the color of her skin&#x2014;including her once beloved, glamorous, worldly Great-Aunt Nette. After they had been estranged for fifteen years, Marra discovers that Nette has Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and that only she is in a position to get Nette back to the only family she has left. Instead of revenge, Marra chooses love, and watches as the disease erases her aunt&#x2019;s racism, making space for a relationship that was never possible before.<br><br> <i>The Color of Love</i> explores the idea of <i>yerusha</i>, which means "inheritance" in Yiddish. At turns heart-wrenching and heartwarming, this is a story about what you inherit from your family&#x2014;identity, disease, melanin, hate, and most powerful of all, love.

Season two premieres in November 2019!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Charles Forsman&#x2019;s hit graphic novel follows James and Alyssa, two teenagers living a seemingly typical teen experience as they face the fear of coming adulthood. Forsman tells their story through each character&#x2019;s perspective, jumping between points of view with each chapter. But quickly, this somewhat familiar teenage experience takes a more nihilistic turn as James&#x2019;s character exhibits a rapidly forming sociopathy that threatens both of their futures. He harbors violent fantasies and begins to act on them, while Alyssa remains as willfully ignorant for as long as she can, blinded by young love.</p> Black &amp; white illustrations throughout.</p><p><strong>Charles Forsman's</strong><em>The End of the F***ing World</em>&nbsp;graphic novel has been adapted into a&nbsp; critically acclaimed television series that is distributed by Netflix. He is also a graduate of the Center for Cartoon Studies. He lives in Hancock, Mass.&#34;When I was thirteen and a half, I found a cat in the woods. I smashed its body with a stone.&#34; Like a teenage metal head&#39;s revenge fantasy world spun out of control, but drawn by a demented Mort Walker, this debut graphic novel is a haunting odyssey. James is an unfeeling and disturbed youth who tortures animals, sticks his hand down a garbage disposal, punches his father in the face, and lacks compassion or feeling for anyone else. At 16, he pretends to fall in love with his classmate Alyssa and convinces her to split town with him after he steals his dad&#39;s car. They break into a house in the suburbs and start playing a clumsy version of house, unable to escape the awkwardness of their age. They also make a disturbing discovery about the homeowner. When he returns, the pair&#39;s fake home life comes crashing down. This is a visceral comic, full of deeply unsettling violent images and actions, though Forsman&#39;s minimalist style helps keep the focus on the impact of the events, not the horror itself. This is not a redemption story, and there are no good people in it. Forsman has crafted a comic that captures youth, frustration, and that deep, dark feeling that maybe things won&#39;t get better when you get older.

Or the time in high school that I got all dressed up for the prom and sat by the window, waiting for a boy who never came. Or the way I felt when I first met Colin.</p><p>Well, I talk a little about that, but I don't admit that from the beginning I knew we were not meant to be together. Colin was a college football star; I'd been hired by his coach to tutor him to pass French. He kissed me- shy, plain, scholarly--on a dare from his teammates, and even muddled by embarrassment, it left me feeling gilded.</p><p>It is perfectly clear to me why I fell in love with Colin. But I have never understood what made him fall for me.</p><p>He told me that when he was with me, he became someone different-a person he liked better than the easygoing jock, the good ol' fraternity boy. He told me that I made him feel admired for what he was instead of what he'd done. I argued that I wasn't a match for him, not tall or stunning or sophisticated enough. And when he disagreed, I made myself believe him.</p><p>I don't talk about what happened five years later, when I was proved right.</p><p>I don't talk about the way he could not look me in the eye while he was arranging to have me locked away.</p><p>Opening my eyes is a Herculean effort, Swollen and grainy, they seem resolved to stay sealed shut, preferring not to risk the sight of something else that might turn the world on end. But there is a hand on my arm, and for all I know it might be Colin, so I manage to slit them enough that the light, sharp as a splinter, comes into view. "Mariah", my mother soothes, smoothing my hair back from my forehead. "You feeling better?"</p><p>"No." I am not feeling anything. Whatever Dr. Johansen prescribed over the phone makes it seem as if there's a foam cushion three inches thick around me, a barrier that moves with me and flexes and manages to keep the worst away.</p><p>"Well, it's time to get moving," my mother says, matter-of-fact. She leans forward and tries to haul me from the bed.</p><p>"I don't want to take a shower." I try to curl into a ball.</p><p>"Neither do I." My mother grunts. The last time she'd come into the room, it was to drag me into the bathroom and under a cold spray of water. "You're going to sit up, damn it, if it sends me to an early grave."</p><p>That makes me think of her coffin table, and of the ballet lesson Faith and I never did manage to get to three days ago. I pull away from her grasp and cover my face, fresh tears running like wax. "What is the matter with me?"</p><p>"Absolutely nothing, in spite of what that cretin wants you to believe." My mother puts her hands on my burning cheeks. "This is not your fault, Mariah. This isn't something you could have stopped before it happened. Colin isn't worth the ground he walks on." She spits on the carpet, to prove it. "Now sit up so that I can bring Faith in here."</p><p>That gets my attention. "She can't see me like this."</p><p>"So, change."</p><p>"It's not that easy-"</p><p>"Yes, it is," my mother insists. "It's not just you this time, Mariah. You want to fall apart? Fine, then-do it after you've seen Faith. You know I'm right, or you wouldn't have called me to come over here and take care of her three days ago." Staring at me, she softens her voice. "She's got an idiot for a father, and she's got you. You make what you want of that."</p><p>For a second I let hope sneak through the cracks in my armor. "Did she ask for me?"</p><p>My mother hesitates. "No ... but that's neither here nor there." As she goes to get Faith, I adjust the pillows behind my back and wipe my face with a corner of the comforter. My daughter enters the room, propelled by my mother's hand. She stops two feet from the bed. "Hi," I say, bright as any actress.</p><p>For a moment I just delight in seeing her--the crooked part of her hair, the space where her front tooth used to be, the chipped pink Tinkerbell polish on her fingernails. She folds her arms and sets her colt's legs and mulishly presses her beautiful bow of a mouth into a flat line.</p><p>"Want to sit down?" I pat the mattress beside me.</p><p>She doesn't answer; she barely even breathes. With a sharp pain I realize that I know exactly what she's doing, because I've done it myself: You convince yourself that if you keep perfectly still, if you don't make any sudden moves, neither will anyone else. "Faith . .</p><p>I reach out my hand, but she turns and walks out of the room.</p><p>Part of me wants to follow her, but a larger part of me can't muster the courage. "She's still not talking. Why?"</p><p>"You're her mother. You find out."</p><p>But I can't. If I have learned anything, it is my own limits. I turn onto my side and close my eyes, hoping that my mother will get the hint that I just want her to go away.</p><p>"You'll see," she says quietly, laying her hand on top of my head.

Here, in his most ambitious and stunning work yet, he rejects the long-standing idea that consciousness is somehow separate from the body, and presents compelling new scientific evidence that posits an evolutionary perspective. His view entails a radical change in the way the history of the conscious mind is viewed and told, suggesting that the brain&#x2019;s development of a human self is a challenge to nature&#x2019;s indifference. This development helps to open the way for the appearance of culture, perhaps one of our most defining characteristics as thinking and self-aware beings.</p></p><p><p>Antonio Damasio is University Professor, David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Neurology, and director of the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California.

I had been asleep long enough to miss the announcements about the landing and the weather. I had not been aware of myself or my surroundings. I had been unconscious. <br>&nbsp;<br>Few things about our biology are as seemingly trivial as this com�modity known as consciousness, the phenomenal ability that consists of having a mind equipped with an owner, a protagonist for one&#x2019;s exis�tence, a self inspecting the world inside and around, an agent seemingly ready for action. <br>&nbsp;<br>Consciousness is not merely wakefulness. When I woke up, two brief paragraphs ago, I did not look around vacantly, taking in the sights and the sounds as if my awake mind belonged to no one. On the con�trary, I knew, almost instantly, with little hesitation if any, without effort, that this was me, sitting on an airplane, my flying identity com�ing home to Los Angeles with a long&nbsp; to-do list before the day would be over, aware of an odd combination of travel fatigue and enthusiasm for what was ahead, curious about the runway we would be landing on, and attentive to the adjustments of engine power that were bringing us to earth. No doubt, being awake was indispensable to this state, but wake�fulness was hardly its main feature. What was that main feature? The fact that the myriad contents displayed in my mind, regardless of how vivid or well ordered, <i>connected </i>with me, the proprietor of my mind, through invisible strings that brought those contents together in the forward-moving feast we call self; and, no less important, the fact that the connection was <i>felt. </i>There was a <i>feelingness </i>to the experience of the connected me. <br>&nbsp;<br>Awakening meant having my temporarily absent mind returned, but with <i>me </i>in it, both property (the mind) and proprietor (me) accounted for. Awakening allowed me to reemerge and survey my mental domains, the sky-wide projection of a magic movie, part documentary and part fiction, otherwise known as the conscious human mind. <br>&nbsp;<br>We all have free access to consciousness, bubbling so easily and abun�dantly in our minds that without hesitation or apprehension we let it be turned off every night when we go to sleep and allow it to return every morning when the alarm clock rings, at least 365 times a year, not counting naps. And yet few things about our beings are as remarkable, foundational, and seemingly mysterious as consciousness. Without consciousness&#x2014;that is, a mind endowed with subjectivity&#x2014;you would have no way of knowing that you exist, let alone know who you are and what you think. Had subjectivity not begun, even if very modestly at first, in living creatures far simpler than we are, memory and reasoning are not likely to have expanded in the prodigious way they did, and the evolutionary road for language and the elaborate human version of con�sciousness we now possess would not have been paved. Creativity would not have flourished. There would have been no song, no paint�ing, and no literature. Love would never have been love, just sex. Friendship would have been mere cooperative convenience. Pain would never have become suffering&#x2014;not a bad thing, come to think of it&#x2014; but an equivocal advantage given that pleasure would not have become bliss either. Had subjectivity not made its radical appearance, there would have been no knowing and no one to take notice, and conse�quently there would have been no history of what creatures did through the ages, no culture at all. <br>&nbsp;<br>Although I have not yet provided a working definition of conscious�ness, I hope I am leaving no doubt as to what it means <i>not </i>to have con�sciousness: in the absence of consciousness, the personal view is sus�pended; we do not know of our existence; and we do not know that anything else exists. If consciousness had not developed in the course of evolution and expanded to its human version, the humanity we are now familiar with, in all its frailty and strength, would never have developed either. One shudders to think that a simple turn not taken might have meant the loss of the biological alternatives that make us truly human. But then, how would we ever have found out that something was missing? <br>&nbsp;<br>We take consciousness for granted because it is so available, so easy to use, so elegant in its daily disappearing and reappearing acts, and yet, when we think of it, scientists and nonscientists alike, we do puzzle. What is consciousness made of? Mind with a twist, it seems to me, since we cannot be conscious without having a mind to be conscious of. But what is mind made of? Does mind come from the air or from the body? Smart people say it comes from the brain, that it <i>is </i>in the brain, but that is not a satisfactory reply. How does the brain <i>do </i>mind? <br>&nbsp;<br>The fact that no one sees the minds of others, conscious or not, is especially mysterious. We can observe their bodies and their actions, what they do or say or write, and we can make informed guesses about what they think. But we cannot observe their minds, and only we our�selves can observe ours, from the inside, and through a rather narrow window. The properties of minds, let alone conscious minds, appear to be so radically different from those of visible living matter that thoughtful folk wonder how one process (conscious minds working) meshes with the other process (physical cells living together in aggre�gates called tissues). <br>&nbsp;<br>But to say that conscious minds are mysterious&#x2014;and on the face of it they are&#x2014;is different from saying that the mystery is insoluble. It is dif�ferent from saying that we shall never be able to understand how a liv�ing organism endowed with a brain develops a conscious mind.</p></p><h2>The Uninvited</h2><p><p>A gothic, bone-chilling Irish ghost story first published in 1941 and now brought back into print.

From this new form of care came new ways of engaging and understanding each other. How such singular human capacities evolved, and how they have kept us alive for thousands of generations, is the mystery revealed in this bold and wide-ranging new vision of human emotional evolution. </p><p><i>Mothers and Others</i> finds the key in the primatologically unique length of human childhood. If the young were to survive in a world of scarce food, they needed to be cared for, not only by their mothers but also by siblings, aunts, fathers, friends&#x2015;and, with any luck, grandmothers. Out of this complicated and contingent form of childrearing, Sarah Hrdy argues, came the human capacity for understanding others. Mothers and others teach us who will care, and who will not. </p><p>From its opening vision of &#x201c;apes on a plane&#x201d;; to descriptions of baby care among marmosets, chimpanzees, wolves, and lions; to explanations about why men in hunter-gatherer societies hunt together, <i>Mothers and Others</i> is compellingly readable.

Any one of us would be lucky to disembark with all ten fingers and toes still attached...Even among the famously peaceful bonobos...veterinarians sometimes have to be called in following altercations to stitch back on a scrotum or penis," Hrdy writes. What she found is that our unique mothering instinct, quite different from gorillas and chimpanzees, meant that the children most likely to survive were those who could relate to and solicit help from others. We evolved to be wired for empathy for, consideration of, and intuition into how others are feeling. (Jessa Crispin <i>Smart Set</i> 2009-02-11)<br><br>To explain the rise of cooperative breeding among our forebears, Hrdy synthesizes an array of new research in anthropology, genetics, infant development, comparative biology. (Natalie Angier <i>New York Times</i> 2009-03-02)<br><br>For as long as she's been a sociobiologist, Sarah Blaffer Hrdy has been playfully dismantling traditional notions of motherhood and gender relations...Hrdy is back with another book, <i>Mothers and Others</i>, and another big idea. She argues that human cooperation is rooted not in war making, as sociobiologists have believed, but in baby making and baby-sitting. Hrdy's conception of early human society is far different from the classic sociobiological view of a primeval nuclear family, with dad off hunting big game and mom tending the cave and the kids. Instead, Hrdy paints a picture of a cooperative breeding culture in which parenting duties were spread out across a network of friends and relatives. The effect on our development was profound.

It's a book you read, pausing regularly to consider the full import of what you just read...Sarah Blaffer Hrdy has added another enormous building block to our thinking about our origins with this new book. Our species is lucky to have her. (Claudia Casper <i>Globe and Mail</i> 2009-05-09)<br><br>Provocative. [Hrdy] argues that unlike other apes, <i>Homo sapiens</i> could never have evolved if human mothers had been required to raise their offspring on their own. Human infants are too helpless and too expensive in their demands for care and resources. So human females have to line up helpers--sometimes extending beyond their own kin--to raise their young. That requires both males and females to invest heavily in social skills for bargaining with other members of their groups. Hrdy suggests that females in ancestral hunting and gathering groups may have thrived because they were free to be flexible in this way. Female flexibility was reduced when humans established settlements requiring male coalitions to defend them, probably leading to greater control of females by males...The most refreshing aspect of [this] book is the challenge [it] offers to what we thought we already knew. (John Odling-Smee <i>Nature</i> 2009-04-30)<br><br>If Sarah Blaffer Hrdy were a male scientist, I might be tempted to say that her new book <i>Mothers and Others</i> arrives like an intellectual time bomb, or that it throws a grenade into accepted notions of human evolution. But those are aggressive, competitive metaphors, and one of the essential points of <i>Mothers and Others</i> is that aggression and competition have been given far too central a place in the standard accounts of how our species came into being. From Charles Darwin onward, those accounts are mostly the work of men, and Hrdy points out in meticulous detail how partial and biased was their understanding of the remote past...<i>Mothers and Others</i> offers enormous rewards. It is not only revolutionary; it is also wise and humane.

If M-theory is proven correct, we may perhaps finally find answer to the question, &#x201c;What happened before the big bang?&#x201d; This is an exciting and unforgettable introduction into the new cutting-edge theories of physics and cosmology from one of the pre-eminent voices in the field.</p></p><p>Is our universe dying? <br>Could there be other universes?<br>In "Parallel Worlds," world-renowned physicist and bestselling author Michio Kaku"--an" author who "has a knack for bringing the most ethereal ideas down to earth" "(Wall Street Journal)--takes readers on a fascinating tour of cosmology, M-theory, and its implications for the fate of the universe. <br>In his first book of physics since "Hyperspace, Michio Kaku begins by describing the extraordinary advances that have transformed cosmology over the last century, and particularly over the last decade, forcing scientists around the world to rethink our understanding of the birth of the universe, and its ultimate fate. In Dr. Kaku's eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy. <br>As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far, the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the "inflationary universe theory," a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory, our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. <br>The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today, physicists overwhelmingly support string-theory, and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this onetheory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly, and answer the question "What happened before the big bang?" <br>Already, Kaku explains, the world's foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless. If parallel worlds do exist, Kaku speculates, in time, perhaps a trillion years or more from now, as appears likely, when our universe grows cold and dark in what scientists describe as a big freeze, advanced civilizations may well find a way to escape our universe in a kind of "inter-dimensional lifeboat." <br>An unforgettable journey into black holes and time machines, alternate universes, and multidimensional space, "Parallel Worlds gives us a compelling portrait of the revolution sweeping the world of cosmology.<p>Dr. Michio Kaku is professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and a co-founder of string field theory.

To his daughter, Violet, he was best known as an amazing father, confidant, and friend. In <i>Ghostbuster's Daughter</i>, Violet reflects on the life and legacy of her father, providing readers with an extraordinarily candid and insightful look into the man who helped shape modern American comedy. <br><br>Funny, endearing, and vulnerable, <i>Ghostbuster's Daughter</i> takes readers into the private life of the American comedy icon, from his humble roots in Chicago and ascension into Hollywood stardom to his personal philosophies on life, love, and filmmaking. While the book offers a comprehensive history of her father's career, <i>Ghostbuster's Daughter </i>also provides a profound homage to their special father-daughter relationship. Violet weaves anecdotes about her father's unique and devoted parenting style among stories of her own unconventional upbringing, creating a vivid and dynamic portrait of the man behind the movies. A distinctly offbeat memoir as well as a charming family story for the ages,<i> Ghostbuster's Daughter</i> is an intimate look at one of America's preeminent comedy filmmakers.</p><p><b>Violet Ramis Stiel</b> is the eldest child of beloved comedy legend Harold Ramis (<i>Animal House, Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day</i>). Formerly a teacher and social worker, Violet is now a full-time writer and disgruntled homemaker. She lives in New York City with her husband and their (blended) six children.Young Love<br><br> Let's start at the beginning-my beginning-with the story of Harold and Anne. My parents first officially met in San Francisco during the summer of 1966. They both attended Washington University, and my dad knew my mom peripherally, as the beautiful girl who had briefly dated two of his roommates. After one of them came home from a hayride with my mom, my dad asked, "How was it?"<br><br> "Weird," the friend said.<br><br> "Weird? Really? How?" He was intrigued.<br><br> "Well," the guy said, "she only spoke in quotes from Billy Budd the whole time."<br><br> Oddly, my dad thought, I gotta meet this girl.<br><br> My mom was vaguely aware of my dad from his college theater work-most notably his role as the priest of Zeus in Oedipus Rex, and writing and performing in several fraternity-related shows.<br><br> The summer after he graduated, in 1966, my dad headed west with his brother, Steven, and college friend David. Soon after arriving in San Francisco, they ended up at the apartment where my mom was staying with two of her girlfriends. He described first seeing her intently watching The Dybbuk (a 1937 Yiddish-language Polish fantasy film drama) on a TV so staticky, you could barely make out the picture. He tried casually chatting with her but she shushed him, leaning closer to the TV. Despite this, he thought she was interesting and beautiful and decided to ask her out for Friday night.<br><br> "I can't," she told him, "I'm seeing the Bolshoi Ballet."<br><br> "Okay, then how about Saturday?"<br><br> "I can't, I'm seeing the Bolshoi Ballet."<br><br> She had bought tickets for the whole run but agreed to go out with him the following week. He knew she was different from other girls he'd dated, but I don't think he realized just quite how different she was until they started spending more time together.<br><br> One day, after my mom and dad had gone out a few times, they were listening to music in her room when, out of nowhere, she slapped him hard across the face. He dramatized this encounter in an autobiographical script he wrote called 2b or Not 2b, about his early twenties. As of now, this screenplay remains unproduced.<br><br> INT. JANE'S HOUSE-LATER It's a rambling Victorian with high ceilings, lots of woodwork, reasonably well-maintained. Her roommates, Haze and Ginger, are watching TV and reading in the living room, which is nicely decorated with inexpensive thrift shop furniture, colorful French posters, and cheap Asian folk art. Jane leads Julian into her bedroom.<br><br> CUT TO: INT. JANE'S ROOM-CONTINUOUS&nbsp; Julian has never seen anything like it. The decor is a cross between an Edwardian boudoir and a harem, a mad mix of Indian cloth, lace, floral prints, an oriental rug, Moroccan leather ottoman, colorfully painted camel-skin lamps with beautiful fringed silk scarves artfully draped over them, ostrich feathers, an art nouveau writing desk, and in the center of the room a graceful, turn-of-the-century chaise longue.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Wow. Incredible.<br><br> JANE<br><br> (lighting candles)<br><br> Do you want to sit down?<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Sure.<br><br> He looks around and sits on the chaise. The rooms smells like it looks-like an exotic potpourri. Jane puts on a record-a beautiful aria.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Opera-cool.<br><br> JANE<br><br> You like it?<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> I don't know. I haven't heard that much.<br><br> JANE<br><br> Well, give it a try. I'm just going to change. One second.<br><br> She disappears behind a lacquered three-panel Chinese screen.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> (looking around)<br><br> Where's your bed?<br><br> JANE<br><br> (from behind the screen)<br><br> You're sitting on it.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> This sofa? Chaise?<br><br> She emerges from behind the screen wearing an exotic, floor-length, flowing white robe embroidered with red roses.<br><br> JANE<br><br> It's not really a chaise. It's called a "fainting couch."<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> (regarding her robe)<br><br> That's incredible.<br><br> JANE<br><br> I just got it. It's from India.<br><br> (She sits next to him.)<br><br> Look at this needlework.<br><br> She gathers the skirt and lays the silken folds in his hands for him to see.<br><br> JANE<br><br> It's done by children in villages so poor they never know if they'll even have anything to eat, but somehow they manage to do this beautiful work. I think that's so . . . tragic.<br><br> Her eyes fill with tears. Julian doesn't know what to say.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Are you okay?<br><br> JANE<br><br> Yes, I'm just sad. How can life be so cruel?<br><br> (really weeping now)<br><br> Julian tentatively puts his arm around her shoulder, trying to be comforting but feeling helpless.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Can I get you anything?<br><br> JANE<br><br> (stops crying)<br><br> No, thank you. I don't want you to think that you have to fix everything for me. It's okay to be sad sometimes. There are real things in life to be sad about.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> I know.<br><br> They look into each other's eyes, then Julian slowly leans in and kisses her tenderly. After a moment their lips part and he sits back, still gazing into her eyes. Suddenly, she slaps him surprisingly hard across the face.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> (shocked and angry)<br><br> What was that for?<br><br> JANE<br><br> I don't know.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> (baffled)<br><br> You don't know? Was it because I kissed you?<br><br> JANE<br><br> I don't think so. I liked it.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Did I do something wrong?<br><br> JANE<br><br> I don't know. Did you?<br><br> Julian stares at her, really indignant but not even sure why.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> That was very weird.<br><br> JANE<br><br> Don't you think you're making an awfully big deal about a little slap?<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> It hurt.<br><br> JANE<br><br> That bad?<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> No, it was just-surprising, that's all.<br><br> JANE<br><br> Maybe that's a good thing.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Yeah, well, hitting me with a chair would be surprising, too, but I don't think it would be a good thing. What were you thinking?<br><br> JANE<br><br> I don't know-that I wanted to slap you. I'm not angry. I'm not offended or insulted. Does there have to be a reason?<br><br> He looks at her for a moment.<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> Just tell me-are you going to be doing that again?<br><br> JANE<br><br> Do you want me to?<br><br> JULIAN<br><br> No.<br><br> JANE<br><br> Then I won't.<br><br> She looks deep in his eyes, then he leans forward and kisses her again, embracing her as they sink down on the fainting couch.<br><br> In case you haven�t picked up on it yet, I�ll just say that my mother, Anne, is a very unusual person. She grew up in a suburb of St. Louis with her parents, Rose and Harry, and her sister, Natalie, who was one year younger. Harry was a hard man who owned a few women�s clothing stores and rode his wife and daughters mercilessly about their weight. Rose likely had undiagnosed depression or bipolar disorder but loved her daughters to the point of worship and did her best to protect them from their father. My mom-angry at her dad, frustrated with her mom, and pitted against her sister-learned early on that living in her own world was her best bet for self-preservation. She threw herself into dance, art, and literature, and was uncompromising in her aesthetics. It makes perfect sense that my dad, an easygoing people-pleaser from the moment he was born, was attracted to this contrarian pixie who unapologetically pushed the limits (and, often, buttons) of everyone around her.<br><br> Harold and Anne returned to St. Louis in the fall of 1966-my mom for her senior year of college, and my dad for a postgraduate program he'd enrolled in but dropped out of after two weeks. My mom took her art history classes during the day and worked as an usher for the American Theater at night. Their courtship was uneventful . . . in a very 1966 way. A typical date could range from going to see the newest movie, to grabbing a pizza, to my dad and his friends taking LSD and my mom, stone sober but with a naturally kaleidoscopic brain, leading them on an adventure through the city. "Your mother almost never drank or took drugs," my dad told me, "but everyone else did, and she was a great inspiration. I remember once . . . well, honestly, I don't really remember how we got there, but I know the night ended with a group of us in a little forest, dancing around Anne like fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream. And I'm sure that wasn't the only time." The young couple met each other's parents (both sets approved) and things seemed to be getting more serious, but my mom continued to date other people and my dad started to worry that someone else was going to come in and swoop her up. In January of 1967, she invited my dad to join her as an usher for a production of The Mikado, and he proposed to her on opening night. She knew right away that she would say yes but didn't give him an answer until the intermission. And so, six months later, on July 2, 1967, at the tender ages of twenty-one and twenty-two, my parents were married, in a traditional Jewish ceremony, under a chuppah my dad had proudly built himself. My mom had her seven bridesmaids wearing dresses from other formal occasions and my dad's tux may or may not have had ruffles and bell-bottoms. About 150 guests, mostly made up of their college friends and my dad's family, attended the reception at the Bel Air Hotel in St. Louis. My mother, true to form, wanted pie instead of a standard wedding cake, so my dad ordered twenty chocolate pies from a local bakery. He entertained the guests while Mom sat raptly listening to the singer, Sid Selvidge, an anthropology student from Memphis, perform an acoustic set of blues and folk songs. Sadly, there are no photos from this bizarre and blessed event because the photographer forgot to put film in the camera.<br><br> Young, in love, and with nothing to lose, they stayed true to their Midwestern roots and moved back and forth between St. Louis and Chicago in their first few years together, following my dad's opportunities for work and my mom's interests for pleasure. They remained close with their core group of college friends, who were largely liberal Jewish artistic types. My parents weren't true hippies but definitely leaned far to the left, politically, at the time. My dad dodged the Vietnam draft in late 1967 by telling the recruiters that he was a gay drug addict (and taking a bunch of speed right before his appointment). He experimented with various types of work and occasionally got hired to sing and play guitar at parties. Though he was interested in pursuing writing and theater as possible careers, he hadn't quite figured out how to break into the creative world. At one point, early in my parents' marriage, he auditioned for a role in The Importance of Being Earnest but was told that his looks were "not Dresden enough" (read: too Jewish) and so he didn't get the part.<br><br> In spite of his slow start, my dad always credited my mom with pushing him outside his comfort zone and putting him on the path that eventually led to his success. The two instances he always cited in terms of my mother's instrumental role in his career trajectory were her encouragement to perform during open mic night at the Hungry I in San Francisco soon after they first met, and her challenge for him to submit a freelance article for the Chicago Daily News a few years into their relationship. "Why not?" was her response to his hesitation in both cases.<br><br> My mom lives in a universe where there are no rules, where anything is possible and the more unlikely something is, the better, which is the ideal mind-set for a boundary-pushing creative. And this idea of rules being flexible carried over in all aspects of her life. Once, when my newlywed parents went shopping at the grocery store, my mom kept jumping out of the checkout line for "one more thing." The lady behind them was getting frustrated and tried to scold my mom: "What if everyone did that?" she asked my mom. "If everyone did it, it would be socially acceptable," my mom snapped back, much to my dad's embarrassment and delight. I think he often walked the line between being deeply respectful of her intelligence and creative spirit and frustrated with her refusal to conform or compromise. As much as Dad may have appreciated my mom's extreme out-of-the-box thinking, neither one of them was particularly interested in "dropping out" and running away with the flower children. Despite their countercultural leanings, they were still just a couple of Midwestern, middle-class Jewish kids trying to make their way, and somebody had to pay the bills.<br><br> Don't Go into Retail<br><br> This was the only advice my grandfather ever gave my dad and he took it very seriously. My dad had worked since he was a kid-bagging and delivering groceries in the family business, and stocking shelves in a department store warehouse-but after he and my mom got married, he realized it was time to think about a career. Despite his college theater background and being a natural performer, my dad's path into the entertainment world was a meandering one. After trying grad school for a couple weeks and realizing it wasn't for him, he went on to work several odd jobs, including taxi driver, adult psychiatric worker on a locked ward in the Jewish Hospital of St. Louis, and full-time substitute teacher in the Robert Taylor Homes on Chicago's South Side. In discussing his seven-month stint in the psych ward with Debba Kunk in a 1982 interview for ONTV, he said, "I wanted to compare my own psychedelic hallucinogenic experience to madness to see what the lines were . . . it was a great job for learning a lot quickly about people and about your own madness. You think twice before you say 'I'm going crazy.'" While much of the work was depressing and serious, there were bright spots. In a 1984 Vanity Fair interview, he described a nonverbal patient who would respond to questions with "bizarre hand gestures that looked like communication but weren't." "So," he said, "everyone assumed, well, it's madness. I took it as a put-on, and I started giving him hand gestures back that were even more ludicrous than his. It was when he laughed that I knew he was as aware as I was." By allowing himself to get on this person's level, he was able to connect with him in a way that others weren't able to. I think this ability to shift perspective and take an unexpected approach is part of what made him so successful in comedy and film (and everything he did, really).<br><br> He brought a similar sensibility to teaching. "Being a full-time substitute is everyone's worst nightmare. You have these kids for one day. You don't know their names, so you only have what they tell you to go on. Every day, I thought the most I could do in those circumstances was to teach them a moral lesson about justice or behavior . . . Rather than try to force something on them, I would try to field whatever it was that they were putting out. There would often-even at ten years old-be a firebrand spokesman for the class who would attack you on racial issues, and in an articulate way, like a young Stokely Carmichael. So I'd try to deal with that in a humane and rational way. Or, if they were into fun and seemed harmless, I'd try to foster it, just make them have the greatest day they ever had in school, so they'd go home and say, 'Well, that was good. I'd like to go back tomorrow'" (ONTV). Although Dad would have made a great psychiatrist or teacher, he was disheartened by his work in the trenches and started looking around for something more fun and creative.</p><h2>Words Of Radiance Part Two</h2><p>Words of Radiance</p><p>Brandon Sanderson was born in Nebraska in 1975.

Storing's view, are somewhat paradoxically entitled to be counted among the Founding Fathers and to share in the honor and study devoted to the founding. "If the foundations of the American polity was laid by the Federalists," he writes, "the Anti-Federalist reservations echo through American history; and it is in the dialogue, not merely in the Federalist victory, that the country's principles are to be discovered." It was largely through their efforts, he reminds us, that the Constitution was so quickly amended to include a bill of rights.<br> <br> Storing here offers a brilliant introduction to the thought and principles of the Anti-Federalists as they were understood by themselves and by other men and women of their time. His comprehensive exposition restores to our understanding the Anti-Federalist share in the founding its effect on some of the enduring themes and tensions of American political life. The concern with big government and infringement of personal liberty one finds in the writings of these neglected Founders strikes a remarkably timely note.</p></p><p></p><h2>Practicing the Way of Jesus: Life Together in the Kingdom of Love</h2><p>Take a casual survey of how people practice their faith, and you might reasonably conclude that Jesus spent his life going door to door offering private lessons, complete with chalkboard and pop quizzes. We think about God in the comfort of our own minds, in isolation from one another; meanwhile the world waits for a people to practice the way of Jesus together. Mark Scandrette contends that Jesus has in mind something more lively for us: not a classroom so much as a kingdom, where our formation takes place not only in our heads but in our hearts and our bodies, and in the company of one another, in a way that blesses the world we've been entrusted with. In <em>Practicing the Way of Jesus</em> Scandrette draws from his experience as a spiritual director and leader of an intentional community, as well as the best contemporary thinking on kingdom spirituality, to paint a picture of life lived together, in the way of Jesus--which is another way of saying life lived to the full.</p><p><strong>Mark Scandrette</strong> is executive director and cofounder of ReIMAGINE, a center for spiritual formation in San Francisco, and the Jesus Dojo, a yearlong intensive formation process inspired by the life and teachings of Jesus. He is the author of <em>Soul Graffiti.</em>"In<em> Practicing the Way of Jesus</em> Mark Scandrette has brought together a remarkable array of stories, ideas and practical exercises that will enable us all to engage our faith more holistically. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more kingdom-focused, justice-oriented approach to spiritual formation." (Christine Sine, author, activist and executive director of Mustard Seed Associates )<br><br>'I am convinced that God's good news spreads best, not through force, but through fascination. Mark Scandrette is fascinating. He lives with imagination and beauty. He is a poet and artist. But he is not just about creative thinking, he is about creative living. His book is an invitation to love creatively and recklessly, so that we might do something to interrupt the status quo, surprise the world with God's goodness and fascinate the world with grace.'<br><br>&#x2014;Shane Claiborne, author, preacher, activist and recovering sinner, www.thesimpleway.org<br><br>'It has been a long time since I was this stirred and humbled by a book. Mark Scandrette is a voice for all who are 'sensing a pull towards a spirituality that is more holistic, integrative and socially engaged.' This inspiring leader of an intentional community gives me deep hope for the future. Reading this book I felt personally moved to be more intentional about living my life the way Jesus would live my life if he were me.'<br><br>&#x2014;Gary W. Moon, Ph.D., Vice President and Chair of Integration, Richmont Graduate University, and author of Apprenticeship with Jesus<br><br>'Mark Scandrette is better than most in helping us move our faith from a thought to a lifestyle. In a magnetic and compelling way, he offers us an irresistible invitation to open our lives to the many ways in which we can follow Jesus. Reading about his 'experiments' in faith makes you close the book and think, 'I can do this! I want to do this!''<br><br>&#x2014;Nancy Ortberg, author of Looking for God: An Unexpected Journey Through Tattoos, Tofu and Pronouns</p><h2>A Winter Haunting</h2><p><p>A once-respected college professor and novelist, Dale Stewart has sabotaged his career and his marriage -- and now darkness is closing in on him. In the last hours of Halloween he has returned to the dying town of Elm Haven, his boyhood home, where he hopes to find peace in isolation. But moving into a long-deserted farmhouse on the far outskirts of town -- the one-time residence of a strange and brilliant friend who lost his young life in a grisly "accident" back in the terrible summer of 1960 -- is only the latest in his long succession of recent mistakes. Because Dale is not alone here. He has been followed to this house of shadows by private demons who are now twisting his reality into horrifying new forms. And a thick, blanketing early snow is starting to fall ...</p></p><p><p>Dan Simmons is the Hugo Award-winning author of <em>Hyperion</em> and <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em>, and their sequels, <em>Endymion</em> and <em>The Rise of Endymion</em>. He has written the critically acclaimed suspense novels <em>Darwin's Blade</em> and <em>The Crook Factory</em>, as well as other highly respected works, including <em>Summer of Night</em> and its sequel <em>A Winter Haunting, Song of Kali, Carrion Comfort,</em> and <em>Worlds Enough &amp; Time</em>. Simmons makes his home in Colorado.</p>The old saw "You can't go home again" is a chilling understatement for this highly effective supernatural shocker, Simmons's first horror novel since Fires of Eden (1994) and a sequel to Summer of Night (1991). The latter was an eerie chronicle of a summer of lost innocence for a group of preadolescent chums who confront an entity of irrepressible evil in rural Elm Haven, Ill. Four decades later Dale Stewart, a survivor of that summer, has returned to endure a winter of adult discontent: his wife has left him, his sideline career as a novelist is sputtering and a disastrous love affair has driven him to attempt suicide. Medicated to the gills for depression, Dale seeks inspiration for his next novel in a house that figured in events of the summer of 1960. But remnants of the old malign influence have survived and they manifest as vicious spectral dogs, threatening neo-Nazi punks, cryptic messages that appear magically on his computer screen and delusions that suggest he's losing his mind. Simmons orchestrates his story's weird events craftily, introducing them as unremarkable details that only gradually show their dark side. In a nod to Henry James, whose psychological ghost story "The Jolly Corner" is repeatedly invoked, he blends jaw-dropping revelations of spiritual intrusion with carefully manipulated challenges to the reader's confidence in Dale's faculties and motivations. Though it features its share of palpable things that go bump in the night, this novel is most unsettling in its portrait of personal demons of despair that imperceptibly empower them. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835 (Indians of the Southeast)</h2><p>Theda Perdue examines the roles and responsibilities of Cherokee women during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a time of intense cultural change. While building on the research of earlier historians, she develops a uniquely complex view of the effects of contact on Native gender relations, arguing that Cherokee conceptions of gender persisted long after contact. Maintaining traditional gender roles actually allowed Cherokee women and men to adapt to new circumstances and adopt new industries and practices.</p><p>Theda Perdue is a professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Her works include <i>Slavery and the Evolution of Cherokee Society, 1540&#x2013;1866</i> and <i>Native Carolinians: The Indians of North Carolina.</i>&#x201c;A fascinating book that truly breaks new ground in the study of Cherokee history, women's history, and American history in general. Exemplifies women's history at its best. She neither concentrates only on so-called notable women&#x2014;those Cherokee women who are supposedly worthy of historical study because they acted like white men&#x2014;or on inserting Cherokee women into an already existing narrative of Cherokee and American history. Instead her work challenges the existing narratives and suggests an alternative reading of history. By characterizing women as agents of cultural persistence, Perdue makes a case that we should not see American Indian women as bit players but as &#x2018;major players in the great historical drama that is the American past.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Margaret Jacobs, <i>Journal of Southern History</i> (Margaret Jacobs <i>Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An interesting and effective overview. . . .

The mind, according to Grof, is essentially "holotropic," that is, like a hologram wherein the whole can be reconstructed from a tiny part. The book's first part analyzes memories of life in the womb and the painful process of birth. This is largely a rehash of Grof's Realms of the Human Unconscious ( LJ 7/75, o.p.). The rest of the book is given to a discussion of our "infinite transpersonal consciousness," wherein we can transcend not only the time-space continuum but even visit other dimensions and parallel universes. Grof purports to be scientific--the word appears often throughout the book--but he is surprisingly short on validation. He accepts without question the spoon bending of Uri Geller and the mental photography of Ted Serios.

One of the museum field&#x2019;s leading consultants and label writers, Serrell&#x2019;s 1996 edition of Exhibit Labels has been a standard in the field since its initial publication. This new edition not only provides expert guidance on the art of label writing for diverse audiences and explores the theoretical and interpretive considerations of placing labels within an exhibition, it also features all new case studies and photographs and thoughts about interpretation in digital media. Exhibit Labels: An Interpretive Approach is a vital reference tool for all museum professionals.</p><p>Since 1979, Beverly Serrell has been an exhibit and evaluation consultant with art, history, natural history, and science museums, as well as zoos and aquariums. Before then, she was head of a museum education department for eight years, and had shorter stints as a high school science teacher and a research lab technician. Serrell holds an MA in science teaching in informal settings and a BS in biology. In 1995, she was a guest scholar at The J. Paul Getty Museum and has received two National Science Foundation grants to conduct research on visitor behavior in museum exhibitions. She has been a frequent museum visitor all her life.Do museum visitors even read wall labels anymore? And if they do, how can writers make these short texts engaging and educational at once? Exhibit Labels: An Interpretive Approach takes an optimistic approach to answering these questions, positing that wall text can indeed be effective when well written and smartly designed. . . .Throughout, author Beverly Serrell shares her insights from nearly four decades of providing advice on exhibits for all manner of museums. (<i>Museum</i>)<br><br>It is not hard to see why this book has remained popular for almost twenty years. Though lengthy, the author practices what she preaches: text is succinct and relevant; conclusions are evidence-based and often thought-provoking. Following Serrell&#x2019;s guidelines, museums are capable of creating a multimedia experience for visitors akin to an interactive documentary. Anyone needing to write interpretive labels for an exhibit obviously will find this book immensely valuable, but even educators not involved in museum work might find this an interesting look at other ways of presenting information in a visual, verbal, and engaging way.

Even the most casual reader will be impressed with: the comprehensive treatment of exhibit labels, the expansive inclusion of literature, and the excellent description of best practices in museum exhibition development. The first edition of Exhibit Labels is still considered the authority on designing labels; this new edition goes well beyond this accomplishment and will no doubt be considered far-and-away the best standard for exhibit label design. Any serious reader will find a plethora of primary source references to explore, an easy-to-read manual for exhibit label development, and an optimistic philosophy that includes the belief that visitors do read labels if they are well designed, and that labels do really make a difference for the visitor experience.

His arguments in support of reasoning from experience, and against the "sophistry and illusion"of religiously inspired philosophical fantasies, caused controversy in the eighteenth century and are strikingly relevant today, when faith and science continue to clash.<br> The <em>Enquiry</em> considers the origin and processes of human thought, reaching the stark conclusion that we can have no ultimate understanding of the physical world, or indeed our own minds. In either sphere we must depend on instinctive learning from experience, recognizing our animal nature and the limits of reason. Hume's calm and open-minded skepticism thus aims to provide a new basis for science, liberating us from the "superstition" of false metaphysics and religion. His <em>Enquiry</em> remains one of the best introductions to the study of philosophy, and his edition places it in its historical and philosophical context.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

From designer pets to lab animals to trained therapy dogs, she deftly explores philosophical, cultural, and biological aspects of animal-human encounters. </p><p>In this deeply personal yet intellectually groundbreaking work, Haraway develops the idea of companion species, those who meet and break bread together but not without some indigestion. &#x201c;A great deal is at stake in such meetings,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;and outcomes are not guaranteed.&nbsp; There is no assured happy or unhappy ending&#x2014;socially, ecologically, or scientifically. There is only the chance for getting on together with some grace.&#x201d;</p><p>Ultimately, she finds that respect, curiosity, and knowledge spring from animal-human associations and work powerfully against ideas about human exceptionalism.</p><p>One of the founders of the posthumanities, Donna J. Haraway is professor in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Author of many books and widely read essays, including The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness and the now-classic essay &#x201c;The Cyborg Manifesto,&#x201d; she received the J. D. Bernal Prize in 2000, a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Social Studies in Science.</p></p><p>Haraway is Professor in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.Donna Haraway&#x2019;s latest book, <i>When Species Meet</i>, is a stunning meditation on the ordinary. Tying together questions of interspecies encounters and alternative practices of world building, Haraway explores how contemporary human beings interact with various critters to form meanings, experiences, and worlds. The text effortlessly slides between theory and autobiography; one of the driving connections in this regard is Ms. Cayenne Pepper, an Australian sheepdog whose &#x201c;darter-tongue kisses&#x201d; compel Haraway to look closely at what biologist Lynn Margulis calls &#x201c;symbiogenesis,&#x201d; a process that explains how life forms continually intermingle, leading to ever more &#x201c;intricate and multidirectional acts of association of and with other life forms.&#x201d; From lab animals to interspecies love to breeding purebreds, Haraway ensures that her readers will never look at human-animal encounters of any sort in the same way again.<br><br>While those familiar with Haraway&#x2019;s oeuvre will find numerous connections to her earlier work, she does an excellent job of narrating how she came to the questions at the heart of <i>When Species Meet </i>and (perhaps most importantly) what is at stake for her in these questions, politically and otherwise. Of particular interest to philosophy buffs are Haraway&#x2019;s gratifying critiques of Gilles Deleuze and F�lix Guattari&#x2019;s well-known writing on &#x201c;becoming-animal&#x201d;; these critiques arise as part of Haraway&#x2019;s overall challenge to the boundaries between &#x201c;wild&#x201d; or &#x201c;domestic&#x201d; creatures. Similarly, her response to Jacques Derrida&#x2019;s ruminations on animals reveals the provocations that can arise from work that pokes holes in conventional disciplinary engagements with any given topic. Haraway&#x2019;s willingness to take on both biology and philosophy, to cite only two of her resources, results in suggestive insights on a number of issues, but especially (with Derrida, et. al.) regarding the question of what it means to take animals seriously.<br><br>I found Haraway&#x2019;s considerable enthusiasm and knowledge in <i>When Species Meet </i>to be invigorating. This book should appeal to a broad audience including animal lovers, scientists and their allies, theorists, and people who love random and little known information (e.g., the history of imported North American gray wolves during South African apartheid). While Haraway emphasizes that her desire to look more carefully at companion species, those &#x201c;who eat and break bread together but not without some indigestion,&#x201d; does not come with any guarantees, she infectiously believes that there is a good deal at stake in the mundane and extraordinary details of the co-shaping species she documents across these pages. Given her hope for the worldly orientations, such as curiosity and respect, that might be cultivated by looking at companion species differently, it is appropriate that she begins and ends the text by reminding us that &#x201c;[t]here is no assured happy or unhappy ending &#x2014; socially, ecologically, or scientifically. There is only the chance for getting on together with some grace.&#x201d;<br><b><br>Review by Marie Draz, </b><i><b>Feminist Review </b></i><b>Blog</b><br><i><b><br></b></i></p><h2>The Art of Death: Writing the Final Story</h2><p><p><b>A moving reflection on a subject that touches us all, by the bestselling author of <i>Claire of the Sea Light</i></b></p><p>Edwidge Danticat&#x2019;s <i>The Art of Death: Writing the Final Story </i>is at once a personal account of her mother dying from cancer and a deeply considered reckoning with the ways that other writers have approached death in their own work. &#x201c;Writing has been the primary way I have tried to make sense of my losses,&#x201d; Danticat notes in her introduction. &#x201c;I have been writing about death for as long as I have been writing.&#x201d; The book moves outward from the shock of her mother&#x2019;s diagnosis and sifts through Danticat&#x2019;s writing life and personal history, all the while shifting fluidly from examples that range from Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez&#x2019;s <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude </i>to Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Sula. </i>The narrative, which continually circles the many incarnations of death from individual to large-scale catastrophes, culminates in a beautiful, heartrending prayer in the voice of Danticat&#x2019;s mother. A moving tribute and a work of astute criticism, <i>The Art of Death </i>is a book that will profoundly alter all who encounter it.</p></p><p><b>Edwidge Danticat</b> is the author of many books, most recently <i>Claire of the Sea Light </i>and <i>Brother, I&#x2019;m Dying</i>. She is a two-time finalist for the National Book Award, and has received the National Book Critics Circle Award and other honors.<p>&#x201c;This book is a kind of prayer for her mother &#x2015; an act of mourning and remembrance, a purposeful act of grieving. . . . Danticat writes beautifully about fellow writers, dissecting their magic and technique with a reader&#x2019;s passion and a craftsman&#x2019;s appraising eye. . . . As a grieving daughter, she wants to understand how others have grappled with this essential fact of human existence; and as a writer &#x2015; a &#x2018;sentence-maker,&#x2019; in the words of a DeLillo character &#x2015; she wants to learn how to use language to try to express the inexpressible, to use her art to mourn.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Danticat taps into such tough subject matter . . . with a trickless, spellbinding clarity. . . . This small book is a bracingly clear-eyed take on its subject.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>The Boston Globe</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Danticat&#x2019;s is a memoir written in a manner akin to the circular, overlapping and overwhelming processes of grief and mourning; she layers her story with other poems, memoirs, novels and essays about death, scaling the personal to wider-ranging political and ecological catastrophes. . . . Deeply felt.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Art of Death</i> offers an inspired syllabus of Danticat&#x2019;s own design. . . . What&#x2019;s important about reading great writing about death &#x2015; or in the case of <i>The Art of Death</i>, reading about reading about it &#x2015; is that it teaches us how to live. Rather than shy away from these books, we should turn to them in all seasons.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;There is, after all, no more universal experience for humans, other than birth, and that is, in some ways, what this beautiful book feels like; it is an offering, almost, a renewal about the ways in which we think about the unthinkable, force ourselves to confront the dark in order to live with light in our lives. It is elegant and thoughtful, and a fascinating meditation on the thing that brings us together.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Nylon</i></b></p><p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s unusual for a craft book to make such an emotional impact, but <i>The Art of Death</i> shows readers&#x2015;through the words of others and through Danticat&#x2019;s own&#x2015;how it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Star Tribune</i></b> (Minneapolis)</p><p> &#x201c;In <i>The Art of Death</i>, Danticat writes clearly and judiciously about a subject that is challenging for both writers and people to face directly.

Part essay, part memoir, part elegy, the book has numerous obsessions &#x2015; lingual, mortal, and parental &#x2015; that come together to compelling effect. Danticat &#x2015; who has published novels, short story collections, a memoir, a children&#x2019;s book, and a volume of poetry &#x2015; combines these forms fluidly, in a meditation as instructive as it is moving.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Remarkably rich. . . . This is a volume that respectfully and brilliantly draws in astute observations about scores of great writers and their relationship with death.

The penultimate section of <i>The Art of Death</i> culminates with a prayer. . . [that] manages to accomplish everything Danticat does throughout <i>The Art of Death</i>: leave you wanting more, while knowing in your heart that what you were given was just enough.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Miami Rail</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Danticat&#x2019;s literary reach is impressive&#x2015;especially so in a book that spans fewer than 200 pages. . . . <i>The Art of Death</i> overflows with life, quietly but insistently inspiring anyone reading it to make good use of what remains of that precious gift.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Shelf Awareness</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Art of Death</i> is a rare blend of criticism and memoir, and it reaches a breathtakingly touching conclusion in the last chapter.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Garrand Conley,<i> Slice Magazine</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Danticat&#x2019;s latest book articulates with fervent heart what we often cannot when faced with loss.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Dianca Potts</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;The author lends a deeply personal touch to this study. . . .

This slim volume wraps literary criticism, philosophy, and memoir into a gracefully circling whole, echoing the nature of grief as &#x2018;circles and circles of sorrow.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p></p><h2>Critically Sovereign: Indigenous Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies</h2><p><i>Critically Sovereign</i> traces the ways in which gender is inextricably a part of Indigenous politics and U.S. and Canadian imperialism and colonialism. The contributors show how gender, sexuality, and feminism work as co-productive forces of Native American and Indigenous sovereignty, self-determination, and epistemology. Several essays use a range of literary and legal texts to analyze the production of colonial space, the biopolitics of &#x201c;Indianness,&#x201d; and the collisions and collusions between queer theory and colonialism within Indigenous studies. Others address the U.S. government&#x2019;s criminalization of traditional forms of Din� marriage and sexuality, the I�upiat people's changing conceptions of masculinity as they embrace the processes of globalization, Hawai&#x2018;i&#x2019;s same-sex marriage bill, and stories of Indigenous women falling in love with non-human beings such as animals, plants, and stars. Following the politics of gender, sexuality, and feminism across these diverse historical and cultural contexts, the contributors question and reframe the thinking about Indigenous knowledge, nationhood, citizenship, history, identity, belonging, and the possibilities for a decolonial future.<br><br> Contributors.

He goes on to consider the importance of missions in the development of evangelicalism and the continuing emphasis placed on evangelism. Sweeney next examines the different subgroups of American evangelicals and the current challenges faced by the movement, concluding with reflections on the future of evangelicalism.<br><br>Combining a narrative style with historical detail and insight, this accessible, illustrated book will appeal to readers interested in the history of the movement, as well as students of church history.</p><p>Douglas A. Sweeney (Ph.D., Vanderbilt University) is associate professor of church history and the history of Christian thought and director of the Carl F. H. Henry Center for Theological Understanding at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.Modern evangelicalism, the biggest thing in Protestantism since the Reformation, has influenced all Protestant denominations--indeed, it has generated most of them. Sweeney depicts it as a child of English Puritanism and German Pietism, born in the Great Awakening, which, inspired by the ideas of Massachusetts' Jonathan Edwards (1703-58), first broke out in John Wesley's England. Almost immediately, England dispatched the great George Whitefield (1714-70) to ensure that North America awoke, too. From then to the present, Sweeney traces evangelicalism's American lineage, proceeding chronologically. He treats each successive principal development: institution building, missionary endeavors, dealing with the infamous U.S. color line, the impacts of the late-nineteenth-century holiness and Pentecostal movements, and the twentieth-century emergence of fundamentalism and neoevangelicalism (it may surprise some to learn that evangelicalism and fundamentalism aren't synonymous). Definitions are made, distinctions drawn, and major figures sketched--all in nimble, unmannered, jargon-free prose that makes this the ideal book to read after, before, or in tandem with Wendy Murray Zoba's <i>Beliefnet Guide to Evangelical Christianity</i> (2005). <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As the cases unfold, Spenser (and Hawk) charm and batter their way past policemen, stockbrokers, hit men, white supremacists, an unstable woman, and a stuffy tenure committee. Author Robert B.

In a series of now-classic books that have been translated into 36 languages and reached millions of readers around the world, he has taught generations of readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. In <i>Linchpin</i>, he turns his attention to the individual, and explains how anyone can make a significant impact within their organization.<br> &nbsp;<br> There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there's a third team, the linchpins. These people figure out what to do when there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art. <br> &nbsp;<br> Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. Linchpin will show you how to join the likes of... <br> &nbsp;<br> � Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces. <br> � Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a r�sum�. <br> � David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffee shop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return. <br> &nbsp;<br> As Godin writes, "Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must."</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Hugh MacLeod Reviews <em>Linchpin</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong> Hugh MacLeod is an artist, cartoonist, and Web 2.0 pundit whose blog, gapingvoid.com, has two million unique monthly visitors. His first book, <em>Ignore Everybody</em>, was an Amazon Top Ten Business Book of the Year and a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestseller. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>Linchpin</em>: </strong> <br> <br> This is by far Seth&#x2019;s most passionate book. He&#x2019;s pulling fewer punches. He&#x2019;s out for blood. He&#x2019;s out to make a difference. And that glorious, heartfelt passion is obvious on every page, even if it is in Seth&#x2019;s usual quiet, lucid, understated manner. <br> <br> A linchpin, as Seth describes it, is somebody in an organization who is indispensable, who cannot be replaced&#x2014;her role is just far too unique and valuable. And then he goes on to say, well, seriously folks, you need to be one of these people, you really do. To not be one is economic and career suicide. <br> <br> No surprises there&#x2014;that&#x2019;s exactly what one would expect Seth to say. But here&#x2019;s where it gets interesting. <br> <br> In his best-known book, <em>Purple Cow</em>, Seth&#x2019;s message was, &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a marketer now.&#x201d; In <em>All Marketers Are Liars</em>, his message was, &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a storyteller now.&#x201d; In <em>Tribes</em>, his message was, &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s a leader now.&#x201d; <br> <br> And from <em>Linchpin</em>? <br> <br> "Everyone&#x2019;s an artist now." <br> <br> By Seth&#x2019;s definition, an artist is not just some person who messes around with paint and brushes, an artist is somebody who does (and I LOVE this term) &#x201c;emotional work.&#x201d; <br> <br> Work that you put your heart and soul into. Work that matters. Work that you gladly sacrifice all other alternatives for. As a working artist and cartoonist myself, I know exactly what he means. It&#x2019;s not what you do, it&#x2019;s the way that you do it. <br> <br> The only people who have a hope of becoming linchpins in any organization, who have any hope of changing anything for the better in real terms, are those who have the capacity to do &#x201c;emotional work&#x201d; at a high level&#x2014;to be true artists at whatever they set their minds on doing. The guys who just plod around the office corridors, just turning up for their paycheck.... Well, those guys don&#x2019;t have a prayer, poor things. The world is just too interesting and competitive now. <br> <br> And Seth then challenges us, the readers, to become linchpins ourselves. To make the leap. To become artists. To do emotional work, whatever the sacrifice may be. It&#x2019;s our choice, and it&#x2019;s our burden. Seth won&#x2019;t be there to catch us if we fall, but to become the people we need to be eventually, well, we probably wouldn&#x2019;t want him to, anyway. <br> <br> Congratulations, Seth. You have penned a real gem of a book here.

Alinsky writes both practically and philosophically, never wavering from his belief that the American dream can only be achieved by an active democratic citizenship. First published in 1946 and updated in 1969 with a new introduction and afterword, this classic volume is a bold call to action that still resonates today.</p><p>First published in 1946 and updated in 1969 with a new Introduction and Afterword, this volume represents the fullest statement of the political philosophy and practical methodology of one of the most important figures in the history of American radicalism. Like Thomas Paine before him, Saul Alinsky, through the concept and practice of community organizing, was able to embody for his era both the urgency of radical political action and the imperative of rational political discourse. His work and writing bequeathed a new method and style of social change to American communities that will remain a permanent part of the American political landscape. <br>"Alinsky is that rarity in American life, a superlative organizer, strategist, and tactician who is also a social philosopher." <br>-- Charles E. Silberman <br>"He cannot be bought; he cannot be intimidated; and he breaks all the rules." <br>-- The Economist <br>(London) <br>"I consider him to be one of the few really great men of our century." <br>-- Jacques MaritainFirst published in 1946 and updated in 1969 with a new Introduction and Afterword, this volume represents the fullest statement of the political philosophy and practical methodology of once of the most important figures in the history of American radicalism.</p><h2>Blood Money (Jane Whitefield, Book 5)</h2><p>"Thomas Perry just keeps getting better," said Tony Hillerman, about Sleeping Dogs--and in this superb new novel by one of America's best thriller writers, Jane Whitefield takes on the mafia, and its money.<br><br>Jane Whitefield, the fearless "guide" who helps people in trouble disappear, make victims vanish,has just begun her quiet new life as Mrs. Carey McKinnon, when she is called upon again, to face her toughest opponents yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane must try to save a young girl fleeing a deadly mafioso.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the deceptively simple task of hiding a girl propels Jane into the center of horrific events, and pairs her with Bernie the Elephant, the mafia's man with the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernie has a photographic memory, and in order to undo an evil that has been growing for half a century,he and Jane engineer the biggest theft of all time, stealing billions from hidden mafia accounts and donating the money to charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-stopping pace, fine writing, and mesmerizing characters combine in&nbsp;<b>Blood Money</b>&nbsp;to make it the best novel yet by the writer called "one of America's finest storytellers,"(San Francisco Examiner).</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, March 2000</b>: When Thomas Perry won his Edgar for Best First Novel from the Mystery Writers of America in 1983, anyone who'd read <i>The Butcher's Boy</i> cheered. That remarkable tale of a <i>likable</i> hit man stayed in one's mind long after the last page had been turned. Now with nine more highly original thrillers to his credit, Perry still knows how to keep us enthralled and, even better, surprised.<p> After several standalone titles, Perry began to produce a series unlike any other, giving us in Jane Whitefield a heroine that I'd have to imagine many of Hollywood's hippest young stars are fighting to play. Introduced in <i>Sleeping Dogs</i>, Jane is a "guide" of a very special kind, a sort of warrior-goddess capable of the most daring feats of cunning and courage who by day pursues a satisfying life off the radar as a suburban surgeon's wife. Her ordinary existence is, in fact, so contented--and her husband so worried for her safety when she's helping mortally threatened men, women, and children--that each time she's approached with a desperate case by a new victim of evil, her first instinct is to say no. But there would be no series if she did, and we would miss her intricately assembled exploits.</p><p> Picture the Scarlet Pimpernel looking like the singer Buffy Ste. Marie (Jane's of native American heritage) and equally skilled at disguise and seat-of-the-pants strategy. Isn't that the sort of companion you'd welcome if you were on the run from the Mob with $20 billion (that's with a "b") of their money, its secret whereabouts all stored mnemonically in your head? Maybe you'd rather have the U.S. Marine Corps on your side, but if that's not an option, newcomers to the Jane Whitefield books will quickly learn (and her fans already know) that she can pull it off on her own. A wonderfully entertaining element of these original adventures is that Jane's guiding principle is simplicity. Thus, the reader's vicarious thrills lie in watching the process, the twists and turns of her schemes and, above all, her amazing capacity for forethought.</p><p> <i>Blood Money</i>, like all the novels by Perry, works equally well on the level of character study as it does in nail-biting suspense. The novels can be read as much for their remarkable insights into human nature as for the excitement of a first-rate thriller. Surely Perry ranks among the very top of the crime-writing fraternity. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><b>Praise for The Face-Changers</b><br>"The momentum never flags, and the suspense constantly builds..the Whitefield novels bring plotting and supsense to center stage without sacrificing character.

All the energy that would ever exist in the entire course of time erupted as a single quantum--a singular gift--existence. If in the future, stars would blaze and lizards would blink in their light, these actions would be powered by the same numinous energy that flared forth at the dawn of time.</p><p>There was no place in the universe that was separate from the originating power of the universe. Each thing of the universe had its very roots in this realm. Even space-time itself was a tossing, churning, foaming out of the originating reality, instant by instant. Each of the sextillion particles that foamed into existence had its root in this quantum vacuum, this originating reality.</p><p>The birth of the universe was not an event in time. Time begins simultaneously with the birth of existence. The realm or power that brings forth the universe is not itself an event in time, nor a position in space, but is rather the very matrix out of which the conditions arise that enable temporal events to occur in space. Though the originating power gave birth to the universe fifteen billion years ago, this realm of power is not simply located there at that point of time, but is rather a condition of every moment of the universe, past, present, and to come.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Particles, light, and time emerged in the beginning. Space, too, unfurled out of potentiality and has continued to unfurl each instant of cosmic existence. In the beginning space foamed forth to create the vast billowing event of the expanding universe. The universe venture was under way. Had the originating powers not gushed forth a world-creating space and time, our cosmos would have existed a quintillionth of a second, just a pinprick event that would have instantly snuffed itself out. The cosmic adventure of fifteen billion years has depended upon the ever-fresh unfurling of nascent space.</p><p>The rate of the spatial emergence reveals a primordial elegance. Had space unfurled in a more retarded fashion, the expanding universe would have collapsed back into quantum foam billions of years ago. Such a collapse would have taken place even if space had unfurled one trillionth of a percent more slowly. If space had emerged more rapidly, equally disastrous results would have followed. The constituents of the universe would have been too widely separated for anything truly interesting to happen.</p><p>The original body of the universe maintained itself in a delicate balance. If either the rate of spatiation or the power of gravitation had wavered too far one way or the other, the adventure of the universe would have ceased. For instance, the universe would never have reached the moment when living cells sprouted forth. The vitality of a dolphin as it squiggles high in the summer sun, then, is directly dependent upon the elegance of the dynamics at the beginning of time. We cannot regard the dolphin and the first Flaring Forth as entirely separate events. The universe is a coherent whole, a seamless multileveled creative event. The graceful expansion of the original body is the life blood of all future bodies in the universe.</p><p>Though this law of expansion was fixed from the earliest instant of existence, other laws were not yet formed at that time. The first particle interactions were not fixed and determined in the way they are today. There was an element of freedom, of randomness, associated with these interactions. The electrons, positrons, the quarks, the neutrinos had not yet achieved their identity. They enjoyed a chaotic freedom of possibilities they would later be denied. Most likely there were even from the beginning innate biases for certain kinds of intensities to these interactions, but there were also in every interaction degrees of freedom that would disappear in later eras.</p><p>The first epoch of the Flaring Forth reached its end when the freely symmetric interactions hardened into a structure. Suddenly the universe as a whole changed phases. What had been symmetric and free was now fixed into particular interactions with determined intensities--the gravitational, the electromagnetic, and the two nuclear interactions.</p><p>These four laws theoretically could have been very different: different in number, intensity, character. Why did these particular four emerge? Perhaps their final form even depended to some extent on the experimentation and exploration of the former, freer era. Perhaps their structure was determined to some degree by what had preceded the moment of symmetry, when a pure or at least original activity had settled into a particular fixed form. If so, these four interactions can be regarded as analogous to habits that the universe adopted for its primary actions. Thus the one primordial act of the universe now appeared as four different activities.</p><p>In this phase transition the fundamental architecture of the universe's interactions was set for all time. It was not yet certain where the largest stars would appear, but the upper limits to their sizes and intensities were already fixed. It was not yet certain how many planets would come into existence, but an invisible ceiling for their highest mountains was already in place because the strengths of the interactions of the mountains' constituents were now in place. It was not at all certain if bivalve mollusks would ever exist, but the possibilities for shell sizes were now determined. It was certainly far from obvious whether or not there would ever exist anything like a mammal, but the fundamental range for how high they could leap or how powerfully they could clamp their jaws was now set into the sinews of the universe.</p><p>The universe established its fundamental physical interactions in a manner similar to the way it unfurled its space--with stunning elegance. Had it settled on a slightly different strong interaction, all the future stars would have exploded in a brief time, making an unfurling of life impossible.</p></p><h2>Sleuthing the Alamo: Davy Crockett&#39;s Last Stand and Other Mysteries of the Texas Revolution (New Narratives in American History)</h2><p>In <em>Sleuthing the Alamo</em>, historian James E. Crisp draws back the curtain on years of mythmaking to reveal some surprising truths about the Texas Revolution--truths often obscured by both racism and "political correctness," as history has been hijacked by combatants in the culture wars of the past two centuries.<br> Beginning with a very personal prologue recalling both the pride and the prejudices that he encountered in the Texas of his youth, Crisp traces his path to the discovery of documents distorted, censored, and ignored--documents which reveal long-silenced voices from the Texan past. In each of four chapters focusing on specific documentary "finds," Crisp uncovers the clues that led to these archival discoveries. Along the way, the cast of characters expands to include: a prominent historian who tried to walk away from his first book; an unlikely teenaged "speechwriter" for General Sam Houston; three eyewitnesses to the death of Davy Crockett at the Alamo; a desperate inmate of Mexico City's Inquisition Prison, whose scribbled memoir of the war in Texas is now listed in the <em>Guiness Book of World Records</em>; and the stealthy slasher of the most famous historical painting in Texas. In his afterword, Crisp explores the evidence behind the mythic "Yellow Rose of Texas" and examines some of the powerful forces at work in silencing the very voices from the past that we most need to hear today. <br> Here then is an engaging first-person account of historical detective work, illuminating the methods of the serious historian--and the motives of those who prefer glorious myth to unflattering truth.<br></p><p><br><strong>James E. Crisp</strong> is Associate Professor and Assistant Head in the Department of History at North Carolina State University.<br><br>"Crisp packs plenty into his little 197-page book."--<em>Greensboro Record</em><p></p><br>"An incredibly engrossing book that reveals the truth behind the Alamo myth. Crisp, a master historian, relates how he researched that truth and in doing so gives us a model of how to let the legend remain just that while revealing historical truth."--<em>Gannett Newswire</em><p></p><br>"This well-written, surprisingly intimate book is indispensable for all who would truly remember the Alamo....'Sleuthing the Alamo' details Crisp's adventures, including chasing down documents, checking translations and grilling a handwriting analyst....'Sleuthing the Alamo' is at least as intriguing for the insight it gives into the historian's craft and the ease with which mythology can prevail over the straight story."--Sam Hodges, <em>Charlotte Observer</em><p></p><br>"A fine place to start if your Alamo knowledge is a little rusty....A first-person account of one historian's detective work. Moreover, the author is an engaging personality--nothing stuffy about him--and his conversational tone here is convincing and reassuring."--<em>San Antonio Express-News</em><p></p><br>"An illuminating account of Crisp's attempt to get to the bottom of not only de la Peas allegations but also the frenetic emotional response to them."--<em>Virginian-Pilot &amp; Ledger Star</em><p></p><br>"Others have written history as detective tale, but none more engagingly or instructively than James Crisp. He nails both the story of the Alamo and the story behind the story. The former is grand tragedy, the latter subtle mystery, and each, in Crisp's telling, is terrific."--H. W. Brands, author of <em>Lone Star Nation</em><p></p><br>"Rarely has a historian uncovered such fabulous mysteries, worked so tenaciously to solve them, or told of his pursuits with such clarity and grace. <em>Sleuthing the Alamo</em> is as absorbing as the best fictional detective stories, but it is true!"--David J. Weber, author of <em>The Mexican Frontier</em> and other award-winning books on southwestern America<p></p><br>"Jim Crisp takes us on an intriguing and fascinating historical adventure, bringing his inquiring intellect to bear on such tried and true topics as Sam Houston, racism and the Texas Revolution, the de la Pe�a diary, and David Crockett's death. Weaving this complex historical narrative into a wide-ranging discussion of cultural change in Texas over more than a century and a half, Crisp shows us how little we know about such familiar events and personalities and suggests challenging implications for his new findings."--Ron Tyler, Texas State Historical Association, University of Texas at Austin<p></p><br>"Far more than a tour de force of Texas history, Crisp's narrative is eloquent, sophisticated and totally engrossing. It is a superb example of how to practice history, as well as a must-read for all Americans interested in the significance of race and culture in our past and present."--Linda K. Salvucci, Trinity University<p></p><br>"A fascinating glimpse into the intensely personal work of a dedicated historian. This is not just another book about the Alamo. Rather, it is a journey into the nitty-gritty world of historical research, set against the backdrop of one of our most mythologized episodes."--Gregg Cantrell, Texas Christian University<p></p><br>"As a case study, this engaging book should find a place in undergraduate libraries, but it is also recommended for any library with an interest in the history of Texas and the West."--<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)<p></p><br></p><h2>The Frangipani Tree Mystery (Crown Colony)</h2><p><p><b>First in a delightfully charming crime series set in 1930s Singapore, introducing amateur sleuth Su Lin, a local girl stepping in as governess for the Acting Governor of Singapore.</b></p><p>1936 in the Crown Colony of Singapore, and the British abdication crisis and rising Japanese threat seem very far away.

It contains representative poems from his early collections <i>The Book of Hours </i>and <i>The Book of Pictures; </i>many selections from the revolutionary <i>New Poems, </i>which drew inspiration from Rodin and Cezanne; the hitherto little-known &#x201c;Requiem for a Friend&#x201d;; and a generous selection of the late uncollected poems, which constitute some of his finest work. Included too are passages from Rilke&#x2019;s influential novel, <i>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, </i>and nine of his brilliant uncollected prose pieces. Finally, the book presents the poet&#x2019;s two greatest masterpieces in their entirety: the <i>Duino Elegies </i>and <i>The Sonnets to Orpheus</i>. &#x201c;Rilke&#x2019;s voice, with its extraordinary combination of formality, power, speed and lightness, can be heard in Mr. Mitchell&#x2019;s versions more clearly than in any others,&#x201d; said W. S. Merwin. &#x201c;His work is masterful.&#x201d;</p><p>This work contains representative poems from the author&#39;s early collections.<b>Rainer Maria Rilke </b>(1875&#x2013;1926) is one of the greatest lyric German poets. Born in Prague, he published his first book of poems, <i>Leben und Lieber,</i> at age nineteen. He met Lou Salom�, the talented and spirited daughter of a Russian army officer, who influenced him deeply. In 1902 he became a friend, and for a time the secretary, of Rodin, and it was during his twelve-year Paris residence that Rilke enjoyed his greatest poetic activity. In 1919 he went to Switzerland where he spent the last years of his life. It was there that he wrote his last two works, <i>Duino Elegies</i><b> </b>(1923) and <i>The Sonnets to Orpheus</i><b> </b>(1923).<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Stephen Mitchell </b>was born in Brooklyn in 1943 and studied at Amherst, the University of Paris, and Yale.

John Bester&#x2019;s selection and expert translation of Miyazawa&#x2019;s short fiction reflects its full range from the joyful, innocent &#x201c;Wildcat and the Acorns,&#x201d; to the cautionary tale &#x201c;The Restaurant of Many Orders,&#x201d; to &#x201c;The Earthgod and the Fox,&#x201d; which starts out whimsically before taking a tragic turn. Miyazawa also had a deep connection to Japanese folklore and an intense love of the natural world. In &#x201c;The Wild Pear,&#x201d; what seem to be two slight nature sketches succeed in encapsulating some of the cruelty and compensations of life itself.</p><p><b>Kenji Miyazawa </b>(1896&#x2013;1933) was born in Iwate, one of the northernmost prefectures in Japan. In high school, he studied Zen Buddhism and developed a lifelong devotion to the Lotus Sutra, a major influence on his writing. After graduating from an agricultural college, he moved to Tokyo to begin his writing career but had to return home to care for a sick sister. He remained in his home in Iwate for the rest of his life. One of his best-known works is the novel <i>Night on the Galactic Railroad</i>, which was adapted into anime in the late twentieth century, as were many of his short stories. Much of his poetry is still popular in Japan today.<br><br> <b>John Bester </b>(1927&#x2013;2010) was a renowned translator of Japanese fiction, including Masuji Ibuse&#x2019;s <i>Black Rain</i>, Kenzaburo Oe&#x2019;s <i>The Silent Cry</i>, and Yukio Mishima&#x2019;s <i>Acts of Worship: Seven Stories</i>, for which he received the Noma Award for the Translation of Japanese Literature."Now, finally, we have been given a collection of Miyazawa&#x2019;s stories...Like the tales of Andersen and the Grimms, many of the stories in&nbsp;<i>Once and Forever</i>&nbsp;may appeal to children: the sort of thoughtful, dark-minded children who like Neil Gaiman&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Coraline</i>. But adults will be the primary audience for the shivers of disturbance these stories send up the spine....for readers who relish the disturbing material of fairy tale, the specificity and surprise of&nbsp;<i>tanka</i>, collisions of the everyday with the supernatural and glimpses of Japan right on the brink of industrialization, this English volume of Kenji Miyazawa&#x2019;s odd, masterly stories will be a delight.&#x201d; &#x2014;Emily Barton, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br>"These tales turn familiar fairy-tale rhythms on their hands, balancing chaos and kindness, the natural and the supernatural, the unsettling and&nbsp; the inspiring.

While in Paris to conduct research and teach a small class of writers, she discovers a spy camera hidden in her room at the Sorbonne Hotel. She notifies the US Embassy, and former FBI profiler Hugo Marston is dispatched to investigate. Almost immediately, the stakes are raised from surveillance to murder when the hotel employee who appears to be responsible for bugging Hancock&#x2019;s suite is found dead.

Mirka is the heroine that girlhood dreams are made of: questioning and smart and willing to take on the world. She constantly battles wits with her stepmother, Fruma, whose argumentative nature and sharp nose conceal a warm and caring nature. Readers view the image of Mirka's deceased mother, who continues to play an influential role in her life. The child, stuck at home with knitting needles, longs to wield a sword and do battle with dragons. Instead she finds herself caught in a battle of wills with a talking pig. That's right: scenes of an Orthodox Jew with a pig add to the humor. The story is a captivating mixture of fantasy and a realistic look at a culture. The girl encounters both a mind-reading witch and a multilingual troll in her quest for a sword with which to fight dragons. Yiddish language and Jewish customs are an essential part of the story and provide excellent bedrock to the tale without overwhelming it. Mirka outwits the troll and obtains the sword, bringing the story to a satisfying conclusion. However, there is more to tell and it is obvious that further adventures await this young heroine. The illustrations are done in a monochromatic palette, with a color change from a warm earthy orange/cream for daytime scenes to a cool lavender/blue for the night scene. With engaging characters and delightful art, Hereville is pure enchantment.&#x2013;Barbara M. Moon, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2010.

Boethius finally has a translator equal to his prodigious talents and his manifold vision. --Joseph Pucci, Brown University</p><p>Unjustly imprisoned and waiting to die, Boethius penned his last and greatest work, <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, an imaginary dialogue between himself and Philosophy, personified as a woman. Reminiscent of Dante in places, Boethius's fiction is an ode-to-philosophy-cum-Socratic-dialogue. Joel Relihan's skillful rendering, smoother to the modern ear than previous translations, preserves the book's heart-rending clarity and Boethius's knack for getting it just right. Listen to him on fortune: "We spin in an ever-turning circle, and it is our delight to change the bottom for the top and the top for the bottom. You may climb up if you wish, but on this condition: Don't think it an injustice when the rules of the game require you to go back down." <p> <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> recalls the transience of the material world, the eternality of wisdom, and the life of the philosopher. Boethius was deeply influenced by the Platonist tradition, and this piece is one of the more powerful and artful defenses of a detachment that feels almost Buddhist. For anyone who's felt at odds with the world, <i>Consolation</i> is a reminder that the best things in life are eternal. Boethius must be right: the book is just as meaningful today as it was in the sixth century when he wrote it. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><p>Joel C. Relihan is Professor of Classics, Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts. He is also author of <i>The Prisoner's Philosophy: Life and Death in Boethius' Consolation</i> (The University of Notre Dame Press, 2006).</p></p><h2>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Poems &amp; Other Writings (LOA #118) (Library of America)</h2><p>No American writer of the nineteenth century was more universally enjoyed and admired than Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His works were extraordinary bestsellers for their era, achieving fame both here and abroad. Now, for the first time in over twenty-five years, The Library of America offers a full-scale literary portrait of America&#x2019;s greatest popular poet.<br><br>Here are the poems that created an American mythology: Evangeline in the forest primeval, Hiawatha by the shores of Gitche Gumee, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, the wreck of the Hesperus, the village blacksmith under the spreading chestnut tree, the strange courtship of Miles Standish, the maiden Priscilla and the hesitant John Alden; verses like &#x201c;A Psalm of Life&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Children&#x2019;s Hour,&#x201d; whose phrases and characters have become part of the culture. Here as well, along with the public antislavery poems, are the sparer, darker lyrics&#x2014;"The Fire of Drift-Wood," &#x201c;Mezzo Cammin,&#x201d; &#x201c;Snow-Flakes,&#x201d; and many others&#x2014;that show a more austere aspect of Longfellow&#x2019;s poetic gift.<br><br>Erudite and fluent in many languages, Longfellow was endlessly fascinated with the byways of history and the curiosities of legend. As a verse storyteller he had no peer, whether in the great book-length narratives such as&nbsp;<i>Evangeline</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Song of Hiawatha</i>&nbsp;(both included in full) or the stories collected in&nbsp;<i>Tales of a Wayside Inn</i>&nbsp;(reprinted here in a generous selection). His many poems on literary themes, such as his moving homages to Dante and Chaucer, his verse translations from Lope de Vega, Heinrich Heine, and Michelangelo, and his ambitious verse dramas, notably&nbsp;<i>The New England Tragedies</i>&nbsp;(also complete), are remarkable in their range and ambition.<br><br>As a special feature, this volume restores to print Longfellow&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i>Kavanagh</i>, a study of small-town life and literary ambition that was praised by Emerson as an important contribution to the development of American fiction. A selection of essays rounds out of the volume and provides testimony of Longfellow&#x2019;s concern with creating an American national literature.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Ann's book contains a wealth of information on wheatgrass - from its nutrient properties to ways of easily growing it for the home juicer. Chapters include: green power from wheatgrass, how wheatgrass chlorophyll works, super nutrition from wheatgrass, how to grow and juice wheatgrass and the many uses of wheatgrass. This is a must for the person serious about incorporating wheatgrass into his or her health regimen.</p><p><b>Ann Wigmore</b> dedicated her life to teaching others the health benefits of natural foods. She spent years experimenting to find simple, healthful, and inexpensive ways to grow and prepare nutrient-rich foods. Wigmore wrote more than 15 books, including <i>The Wheatgrass Book</i> and <i>Be Your Own Doctor</i>.<p><i>Other Avery books by Ann Wigmore</i></p><p>BE YOUR OWN DOCTOR<br>THE HEALING POWER WITHIN<br>THE HIPPOCRATES DIET AND HEALTH PROGRAM<br>RECIPES FOR LONGER LIFE<br>THE SPROUTING BOOK<br>WHY SUFFER?</p><p></p><p>Foreword</p><p>Wheatgrass juice is fast becoming the most popular &#x201c;new&#x201d; health and diet food in America. In actuality, however, this sweet green juice pressed from young wheat plants is not new&#x2014;it was first applied to human health by Ann Wigmore, founder of the Hippocrates Health Institute, over thirty years ago. Since then, more than half a million glasses of wheatgrass juice have been consumed at the Hippocrates Institute in Boston alone!</p><p>Ann Wigmore has used wheatgrass juice on a daily basis for three decades. At the age of seventy-five, she is the epitome of health and vitality. She is constantly on the go, lecturing, traveling, and writing&#x2014;often about wheatgrass juice. For as she points out in this book, fresh wheatgrass juice is an ideal food for anyone who wishes to prevent illness and improve his or her health.</p><p>While wheatgrass juice is rapidly increasing in popularity, many people lack an awareness of its proper role in a healthful lifestyle. <i>The Wheatgrass Book</i> is the most complete and authoritative guide to the subject of using wheatgrass juice for maximum benefit. The fresh juice of young wheat plants is a storehouse of natural vitamins, minerals, chlorophyll, enzymes, and life energy. In this book, you will learn how wheatgrass juice helps to nourish every cell of the body, and cleanse them of toxins. It is perhaps the safest and most effective way to healthfully supplement your diet.</p><p>During the last sixteen years I have had the privilege of administrating several popular wholistic health centers in the United States and Europe. As executive director of the Hippocrates Institute, I have witnessed many complete reversals of symptoms. I attribute these to the remarkable regenerative power of wheatgrass juice and live foods (the uncooked sprouts, greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds that are part of the Hippocrates Diet and Health Program).</p><p>A few years ago, with the encouragement of India&#x2019;s former prime minister, Morarji Desai, and the assistance of prominent physicians such as Dr. G. Datey, M.D., Ann traveled to India to establish a number of healing camps, where she administered wheatgrass and live foods to hundreds of sick and malnourished men, women, and children. She has published dozens of articles reporting the amazing rate of recovery experienced by many of these people.</p><p>In the United States, the effectiveness of wheatgrass and live foods in preventing illness has been praised by Dr. Arthur Robinson, the director of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. In 1978 at the Linus Pauling Institute, Dr. Robinson completed a research project in which wheatgrass and live foods were fed to mice with squamos cell carcinoma. In Dr. Robinson&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;The results were spectacular. Living foods [including wheatgrass] alone decreased the incidence and severity of cancer lesions by about 75 percent. This result was better than that of any other nutritional program that was tried.&#x201d; Dr. Robinson is presently conducting a research project involving Hippocrates Health Institute guests.</p><p>Over the years, many guests at the Hippocrates Institute have requested that Ann write a concise book about wheatgrass juice. I am happy to say that <i>The Wheatgrass Book</i> has been worth waiting for. It is filled with practical information about growing and using wheatgrass. In addition, this book summarizes the most interesting medical research on wheatgrass juice. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll enjoy reading <i>The Wheatgrass Book</i> as much as I have, and I&#x2019;m sure that your first refreshing drink of wheatgrass juice will be your start toward a more satisfying and healthful lifestyle.</p><p>Brian Clement<br>November, 1984<br>Boston, Massachusetts</p><p>Preface</p><p>The Wheatgrass Way to Super Health and Beauty</p><p>We walk over it, lie down on it, mow it once a week during the summer, and knock little white balls into holes cut in it, but the thought of <i>eating</i> grass seems absurd. Unless you happen to be the winner of the Kentucky Derby, or Aunt Nellie&#x2019;s prize heifer, you probably have never entertained the thought of chewing on a bunch of grass. And if you haven&#x2019;t visited the Hippocrates Health Institute, chances are that you have not tried wheatgrass juice.</p><p>In this book I hope to persuade you to consider using wheatgrass and its juice as food, medicine, and an overall tonic for various ailments. Whether you suffer from chronic fatigue, sinusitis, ulcers, or a more serious illness like cancer, wheatgrass chlorophyll extracted from seven-day-old wheat sprouts may help you even where other medicines have failed. Of course, nothing can replace a sound diet, exercise, and a positive attitude in keeping you in top shape. But wheatgrass can give you energy and strength to help you gain better control of your health.</p><p>Chlorophyll, the green juice of grasses, has been valued since biblical times. Grass has been used as a folk medicine remedy by many people around the world. During the First World War, I began to learn about its remarkable healing properties. My grandmother used grasses to heal wounded soldiers in the European village where I was born. I came to America to live with my parents while I was still a child. It wasn&#x2019;t until about thirty years later, during the early 1950s, that the memories of my grandmother&#x2019;s use of grasses and other plants resurfaced as a result of personal health problems.</p><p>I began my own experimentation with wheatgrass and other grasses on animals. Wheatgrass proved to be the fastest and easiest variety of grass to grow. The wheatberries used to grow it were (and still are) inexpensive and easily obtained. Moreover, wheatgrass turned out to be favored by my pets. It worked miracles for their well-being (I will show you how you can use it to help your pets live longer and in better health in Chapter 8), yet I still doubted its usefulness for human health. So I expanded my study of grasses, focusing on wheatgrass in particular.</p><p>I contacted my friend and associate Dr. G. H. Earp Thomas for his expert opinion of the potential usefulness of wheatgrass for human health. A soil and plant scientist, Dr. Thomas had prior knowledge of grasses and chlorophyll. Yet after a few weeks of chemical analysis and library research, he was quite surprised to find that wheatgrass contained many vital nutrients which he felt could serve as regenerative and protective factors in human health. According to his findings, fresh wheatgrass juice was theoretically capable of sustaining human health and life for weeks or even months at a time. Dr. Thomas also came across some research papers written by Dr. Charles Schnabel, who advocated the use of young wheat and other grasses in animal and human nutrition. Schnabel estimated that fifteen pounds of wheatgrass was equal in protein and overall nutritional value to three hundred and fifty pounds of ordinary garden vegetables. I will speak more about the nutritional content of wheatgrass in Chapter 5.</p><p>The real proving ground was my own body, which was sickly and weak after twenty years of living and eating as an average American. A few weeks after I started chewing and juicing young blades of fresh wheatgrass, and eating fresh sprouts and greens, a festering case of colitis that I had suffered with for months began to improve. The problem, which is particularly difficult to remedy with conventional medical treatments, eventually cleared up entirely.</p><p>My energy level soared and I felt well again. I <i>knew</i> that wheatgrass was a powerful invigorator of the body. To prove to myself that it would also help others get well I began delivering fresh wheatgrass juice to a number of bedridden ill and elderly people in my neighborhood. I was amazed at the results. In a matter of weeks, all of them were able to get out of bed, and they became more active than they had been in years.</p><p>I&#x2019;m sure that much of the degeneration and illness we suffer from today is brought on by the lack of vitality and life in the food we eat. Most food that Americans eat is overcooked and half-dead (for example, 100 percent of the enzymes in food are destroyed by cooking). Beverages are loaded with sugar, alcohol or stimulants that create an illusion of energy which fades quickly as the day wears on. In contrast, the nutrients in wheatgrass and raw foods such as sprouts, fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and Hippocrates Diet preparations made from them, are not destroyed by cooking or processing. These <i>living</i> foods can restore vigor and energy to an ailing, tired body.</p><p>For years, at the Hippocrates Health Institute in Boston, we have been witnessing a transformation in our guests&#x2014;they arrive worn out and run down, and return home vitalized and full of pep.</p><p>An analysis of blood samples drawn from more than two hundred Hippocrates guests before and after the two-week program gave scientific support to our observations. Performed at the Arthur Testing laboratory by Thelma Arthur, M.D., the study showed that within two weeks of following the Hippocrates <i>live food</i> Diet and drinking wheatgrass juice, the blood is detoxified and the immune system is strengthened. Both of these changes lead to more energy and an improved ability to combat and reverse illness.</p><p>Wheatgrass is not only healthful, it&#x2019;s easy to grow and easy to use. With a handful of wheatberries, some water, a tray filled with an inch of topsoil, and a cover, you can grow your own wheatgrass in just seven days&#x2014;at a cost of about ten cents a tray. If you can&#x2019;t grow the grass yourself, you can probably buy it locally from someone who does, because there are wheatgrass and sprout growers in almost every major city in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>A tray of wheatgrass yields about seven to twelve ounces of juice (depending upon the size of the tray). Once you get some juice (about one to four ounces at a time will do) all you have to do to get its health benefits is drink it. Some people enjoy the taste, but even if you dislike it at first, you will love the way you feel within a few minutes&#x2014;and for hours later.</p><p>In addition to drinking wheatgrass juice, there are dozens of other ways you can benefit from it. For example, wheatgrass juice can be used as a scalp treatment for lusterless hair, or as a cleanser, astringent, and tightener for all types of skin. Several drops in each nostril will help to clear blocked sinuses, and a few ounces in your bath water or rubbed into your skin will stimulate healthy circulation and give you a warm glow. But that&#x2019;s not all. True to my childhood memories of wounded soldiers becoming well through the use of grasses, wheatgrass helps heal cuts and bruises faster, and draws poisons out from deep inside the body so they can be eliminated.</p><p>Who can benefit from using wheatgrass? Anyone. Whether you&#x2019;re overweight or underweight, have a tendency towards anemia or are afraid of cancer, wheatgrass can help. In this book I will show you how you can use wheatgrass for cleansing and healing your body, improving your diet and appearance, and preventing illness.</p><p>In addition I will share my discovery of the wheatgrass fast, a shortcut to better health and weight loss that combines wheatgrass and chlorophyll-rich &#x201c;green drinks&#x201d; with special cleansing techniques. Finally, you will also find some delicious recipes that are popular favorites at the Institute. Have you heard of a Grasshopper? Wait until you try your first Wheatgrasshopper (see here)!</p><p>One question I&#x2019;m often asked is, &#x201c;Do I have to change my diet totally in order to benefit from wheatgrass?&#x201d; Of course not. However, I do feel that for the best possible results you should follow the Hippocrates Diet of raw, living foods as closely as you can. I also recommend that you use fresh wheatgrass rather than dehydrated or tablet forms. These serve as a good source of dietary fiber, but they carry with them little of the life force (enzyme power) found in fresh wheatgrass juice. In fact, at the Institute we suggest that you juice wheatgrass immediately after you cut it, and drink or use it right after you juice it, thereby getting the maximum benefit of its enzyme life forces.</p><p></p><p><b>Thriving Wheatgrass</b></p><p></p><p>From the juice bars of California to the health spas of New York, wheatgrass is fast becoming one of the most widely used supplemental health foods. After years of experience of working with wheatgrass, it is my feeling that if you begin to use fresh wheatgrass juice on a regular basis, you will gain a bounce in your step, a better physique, an improved complexion, and a sparkle in your eyes. And it is my hope that your use of wheatgrass juice will help to move the medical establishment toward more research on this valuable nutritional and health aid.</p><p>1</p><p>Green Power From Wheatgrass</p><p></p><p><i>The greatest service to any country is to add a useful plant to its culture.</i></p><p>Thomas Jefferson</p><p></p><p>Wheatgrass can help you get more from your life&#x2014;more energy to be active, more confidence in your ability to stay healthy, and more hours alert and awake each day to accomplish your goals in life. I am assuming you are reading this book because you feel there is room for improvement in your health. Maybe you get worn out easily, wake up tired or in pain, or can&#x2019;t manage to drop those ten extra pounds by the end of the spring anymore. In any case, you&#x2019;re probably right: there is room for improvement in your health and wheatgrass juice could be your route to a healthier, happier life.</p><p><b>MORE ENERGY</b></p><p>Millions of Americans, young and old, are drained of their energy by the end of a day, despite the fact that most of them walk less than two blocks and sleep eight to ten hours. Many middle-aged people accept the loss of youthful energy as an inevitable product of aging. I used to feel that way, but that was before I discovered wheatgrass and raw foods.</p><p>Do we have to settle for less energy at any age? I haven&#x2019;t, and you don&#x2019;t have to either. Long-lasting fatigue is abnormal and is largely caused by a poor diet. Modern life demands a great deal of energy which cannot be adequately replenished by a nutritionally imbalanced diet. While a certain amount of fatigue after a long day of work is normal, when a night&#x2019;s rest doesn&#x2019;t leave you perfectly refreshed and recharged, there is a problem. If you wake up looking and feeling as tired as when you went to bed you are not getting what your body needs from your diet&#x2014;or you are getting too many things you <i>don&#x2019;t</i> need and they are blocking your flow of energy. Wheatgrass can help you restore a high energy level in two ways. First, by fulfilling nutritional deficiencies, and second, by removing wastes that clog your cells, blood, tissues, and organs.</p><p>Each of us is the keeper of over ten trillion little batteries called cells. Like flashlight batteries, our cells hold a charge of electricity. In order for this charge to be strong and steady we need to have a steady supply of the proper nutrients, especially the high-quality minerals, vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids contained in wheatgrass juice. With the addition of wheatgrass and raw foods to your diet, your cells will store a maximum electrical charge, and you will have plenty of energy. At the same time, wheatgrass will help to release excess fats, mineral deposits, and proteins that are trapped in the organs of digestion and elimination, and in the blood, thus saving you energy that would otherwise be spent in your body&#x2019;s struggle to cleanse itself.</p><p><b>WHEATGRASS CAN LENGTHEN YOUR DAY</b></p></p><h2>Stop-Time: A Memoir</h2><p>First published in 1967, <i>Stop-Time</i> was immediately recognized as a masterpiece of modern American autobiography, a brilliant portrayal of one boy's passage from childhood to adolescence and beyond.

Brian Dillon&#x2019;s style incorporates diverse features of the essay. By turns agglomerative, associative, digressive, curious, passionate, and dispassionate, his is a branching book of possibilities, seeking consolation and direction from Michel de Montaigne, Virginia Woolf, Roland Barthes, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Georges Perec, Elizabeth Hardwick, and Susan Sontag, to name just a few of his influences. Whether he is writing on origins, aphorisms, coherence, vulnerability, anxiety, or a number of other subjects, his command of language, his erudition, and his own personal history serve not so much to illuminate or magnify the subject as to discover it anew through a kaleidoscopic alignment of attention, thought, and feeling, a dazzling and momentary suspension of disparate elements, again and again.</p><p>Imagine a type of writing so hard to define its very name means a trial, effort or attempt. An ancient form with an eye on the future, a genre poised between tradition and experiment. The essay wants above all to wander, but also to arrive at symmetry and wholeness; it nurses competing urges to integrity and disarray, perfection and fragmentation, confession and invention. How to write about essays and essayists while staying true to these contradictions? Essayism is a personal, critical and polemical book about the genre, its history and contemporary possibilities. It&#x2019;s an example of what it describes: an essay that is curious and digressive, exacting yet evasive, a form that would instruct, seduce and mystify in equal measure. Among the essayists to whom he pays tribute &#x2013; from Virginia Woolf to Georges Perec, Joan Didion to Sir Thomas Browne &#x2013; Brian Dillon discovers a path back into his own life as a reader, and out of melancholia to a new sense of writing as adventure.<b>Brian Dillon </b>was born in Dublin in 1969.

From the award-winning author of the acclaimed <b>Kissed a Sad Goodbye</b>...<br><br><b>A FINER END<br><br></b>When Duncan Kincaid&#x2019;s cousin Jack calls from Glastonbury to ask for his help on a rather unusual matter, Duncan welcomes the chance to spend a relaxing weekend outside of London with Gemma--but relaxation isn&#x2019;t on the agenda. Glastonbury is revered as the site of an ancient abbey, the mythical burial place of King Arthur and Guinevere, and a source of strong druid power. Jack has no more than a passing interest in its history--until he comes across an extraordinary chronicle almost a thousand years old. The record reveals something terrible and bloody shattered the abbey&#x2019;s peace long ago--knowledge that will spark violence that reaches into the present. Soon it is up to Duncan and Gemma to find the truth the local police cannot see. But no one envisions the peril that lies ahead--or that there is more at stake than they ever dreamed possible.</p><p>Although P.D. James has made it to the top of American bestseller lists, she's not the only talented female writer of British mysteries who is popular here. Like James, Deborah Crombie is another exceptional stylist who uses every new book in a series as an opportunity to explore the emotional complexity of her central characters and further reveal the many dimensions of their personal and professional lives. Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and his partner and lover, Sergeant Gemma James, are at a crossroads in their relationship. But far more compelling to both of them are their investigations in Glastonbury, the mythical burial place of King Arthur and Guinevere, where Kincaid's cousin Jack has discovered a thousand-year-old secret. Jack hasn't deciphered it yet--it's being transmitted to him by "automatic writing" in communiqu�s that seem to be coming (in church Latin, of course) from a monk who's been dead for centuries. Of course there's a murder involved--a couple of them, actually--but by the time Kincaid's involvement is officially sanctioned as an investigation rather than a favor for a relative, the reader has been drawn deeply into a much more ancient mystery. <p> As usual, Crombie creates secondary characters who are as interesting and carefully developed as Kincaid and James: a middle-aged vicar whose life is nearly snuffed out just as she's fallen in love for the first time; a pregnant teenager with apparently psychic abilities that are somehow linked to the ruins of Glastonbury's old abbey; a mendacious historian who understands the true value of the mysterious "letters" from Brother Edmund; and especially the Company of Watchers, the spirits who guard Britain's spiritual heart, who are said to watch over King Arthur until he rises again. There's more than a smidgen of New Age-iness about this somewhat atypical Crombie thriller, but perhaps that will help widen her appeal and bring her the attention her brilliant but largely unknown books deserve. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>&#x201c;CROMBIE has laid claim to the literary territory of moody psychological suspense owned by P.

He has promised the weekend to Kit, the eleven-year-old son of his ex-wife. The son he never knew he fathered -- who doesn't yet know Kincaid's true identity. <br><br>But Duncan's best intentions are shattered by an investigation that draws him in and swiftly consumes him. It seems to begin with the discovery of the body of a beautiful young woman in an East London park. But Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James will discover that this case has long roots that reach far back into the past, and that resentments which should have been decades buried still have the power to hurt -- and maybe even the capacity to kill.</p><p>Nominated for an Edgar, Deborah Crombie's 1997 <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i> was such a triumph in all respects that it's a hard act to follow. <i>Kissed a Sad Goodbye</i>, Crombie's sixth book about Scotland Yard's Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, isn't quite as spectacular as her previous rendition. Still, the author who creates her very British world from a town in North Texas has managed to come up with an entirely respectable and highly enjoyable effort. Her story offers a fascinating setting in place of the poignant, personal drama that invigorated <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i>.<p> The body of a lovely young woman is found in London's fashionable Docklands area. She turns out to be Annabelle Hammond, the director of an old family firm of tea merchants. She was a woman of tremendous talent and sexual appetite, but also the kind of harsh and abrasive personality that provides plenty of motives for murder. The Hammond family is also historically linked to the self-made property developer Lewis Finch and his son, an activist dropout and street musician. The other suspects include a spineless boyfriend who works at the tea firm, a secretary too loyal to be true, and herrings of various shades of crimson. Kincaid and James have to solve it all, even as their own personal problems threaten to intrude. Thanks to Crombie's enviable ability to bring people and places to life with a single phrase, the story zips along like the new Docklands electric railroad.</p><p> Previous Kincaid-James books in paperback include <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i>, <i>All Shall Be Well</i>, <i>Leave the Grave Green</i>, and <i>Mourn Not Your Dead</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Deborah Crombie&#39;s five previous Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James novels have been nominated for the Agatha, Macavity, and Edgar Awards.

The meeting -- which lasted ten minutes -- did not go well. Their loud and aggressive confrontation became the stuff of instant legend, but precisely what happened during that brief confrontation remained for decades the subject of intense disagreement.</p><p>An engaging mix of philosophy, history, biography, and literary detection, <em>Wittgenstein's Poker</em> explores, through the Popper/Wittgenstein confrontation, the history of philosophy in the twentieth century. It evokes the tumult of fin-de-si�cle Vienna, Wittgentein's and Popper's birthplace; the tragedy of the Nazi takeover of Austria; and postwar Cambridge University, with its eccentric set of philosophy dons, including Bertrand Russell. At the center of the story stand the two giants of philosophy themselves -- proud, irascible, larger than life -- and spoiling for a fight.</p></p><p><p>David Edmonds is an award-winning journalists with the BBC. He's the bestselling authors of <em>Bobby Fischer Goes to War</em> and <em>Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Poker</em>.<br><br></p><p>John Eidinow is an award-winning journalist with the BBC. He's the bestselling authors of <em>Bobby Fischer Goes to War</em> and <em>Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Poker</em>.</p>In October 1946, philosopher Karl Popper arrived at Cambridge to lecture at a seminar hosted by his legendary colleague Ludwig Wittgenstein. It did not go well: the men began arguing, and eventually, Wittgenstein began waving a fire poker toward Popper. It lasted scarcely 10 minutes, yet the debate has turned into perhaps modern philosophy's most contentious encounter, largely because none of the eyewitnesses could agree on what happened. Did Wittgenstein physically threaten Popper with the poker? Did Popper lie about it afterward? BBC journalists Edmonds and Eidinow use the controversy as a springboard to probe the whys and whats of these two great thinkers, weaving biography, journalism and philosophy to produce one of the year's most entertaining and intellectually rich books. The authors show that the debate was a clash at several levels. First, of personalities: each was "bullying, aggressive, intolerant and self-absorbed"; in other words, accustomed to winning and unlikely to back down. Second, of class: Wittgenstein was an Austrian aristocrat, Popper was bourgeoisie (each fled Vienna to escape Hitler). And third, of ideas: Wittgenstein believed that philosophy boiled down to nothing more than a series of linguistic puzzles, while Popper thought philosophy involved real problems that immediately affected the world at large. Clearly, the stakes were high for both men in that lecture hall especially because their common mentor, the aging icon Bertrand Russell, was also in attendance. The debate thus took on the character of a succession for the throne. Tightly constructed and extraordinarily well written, this is a marvelous blend of lay and academic scholarship. It has every chance of becoming a classic of its kind. (Nov.)Forecast: Smart, general readers will gobble up this latest addition to narrative nonfiction. It will surely find a place for itself among The Professor and the Madman and An Eternal Golden Braid.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>We Live in Water: Stories</h2><p><p><strong>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, the first collection of short fiction from Jess Walter&#x2014;a suite of diverse and searching stories about personal struggle and diminished dreams, all of them marked by the wry wit, keen eye, and generosity of spirit that has made him a bookseller and reader favorite</strong></p><p>Stories in<em> We Live in Water </em>range from comic tales of love to social satire and suspenseful crime fiction.

People like my older brother, who had his life plan scrawled out on a piece of paper by age seven, are the kind of folks who move from one goal to another, ticking things off their lists and achieving Big Things.</p><p>Other people wander through their early years without a clear path in mind, but still end up where they should have been all along. These would be people like my best friend, Kristen, who enjoyed high school chemistry so much that when the college-major decision came up, biochemistry seemed the obvious choice, and she ended up with a PhD. As it turned out, however, she did not enjoy working for a large pharmaceutical company, so she quit, came home to northern Michigan, kicked around ideas about what to do with the rest of her life, and opened up Three Seasons, which quickly became one of the finest restaurants in the region.</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s me.</p><p>From age ten I knew I wanted to be a librarian, but beyond that I had no course charted out for my life. When I found a posting for assistant director at the district library in Chilson, Michigan, not long after I was handed my master&#x2019;s degree in library and information science, though, I felt a ping of fate.</p><p>Chilson is a small tourist town in the northwest part of Michigan&#x2019;s lower peninsula. It was where I&#x2019;d spent childhood summers with my aunt Frances. It was where I&#x2019;d met Kristen. It is a land of lakes and hills and has a laid-back atmosphere where &#x201c;business casual&#x201d; means &#x201c;clean jeans and a shirt without too many wrinkles.&#x201d; It was my favorite place in the entire world, and getting my dream job in a dream location was something I could not possibly have planned.</p><p>Of course, there were drawbacks, and that wasn&#x2019;t even counting the facts that at thirty-three I was never going to grow past the five-foot mark, that my curly black hair was never going to straighten, and that I didn&#x2019;t know how my beloved new bookmobile would handle the upcoming winter.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing it again, Minnie,&#x201d; Aunt Frances said.</p><p>We were sitting in her kitchen, because although the dining room that overlooked the tree-filled backyard was a lovely place to eat during the warm months, when the weather grew cooler, chill drafts curled around our ankles and the two of us beat a happy retreat to the warmth of the kitchen.</p><p>In summer, though, the kitchen wasn&#x2019;t nearly big enough, because in June through August my aunt took in boarders. Six, to be exact: three female and three male, each of whom was single and unattached.</p><p>My aunt had an extensive interview process for her summer folks. Though she told the prospective boarders that she wanted to determine compatibility for the unusual living arrangements (the boarders cooked Saturday breakfast), she was actually starting her process of secret matchmaking. No one ever knew that they were being set up, and, in her years of taking in boarders, she&#x2019;d failed only once, and even that wasn&#x2019;t a complete failure.</p><p>But that had been last summer, back in the days of warmth and sunshine and a town busy with tourists. Now, in early November, the summer residents were long gone, the tourists wouldn&#x2019;t be back until late May, and my aunt and I were rattling around in a house far too big for two, even with most of the upstairs rooms closed off.</p><p>Of course, sometimes it wasn&#x2019;t nearly big enough for three, considering the nature of the third.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you hear him?&#x201d; Aunt Frances asked.</p><p>I did. I started to stand, but she waved me down. &#x201c;Finish your breakfast. I&#x2019;ll clean up his mess after the two of you leave. It&#x2019;s not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrr.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie, my black-and-white tabby cat, padded into the room and jumped onto my lap. His head poked up over the tabletop and he reached forward.</p><p>&#x201c;Not a chance, pal.&#x201d; I moved the bowl of oatmeal out of his reach. &#x201c;You know the rules.&#x201d;</p><p>Aunt Frances laughed. &#x201c;He may know the rules, but I don&#x2019;t think he has any intention of following them.&#x201d;</p><p>Gently, I pushed at his head, trying to make him lie down, but he pushed it back up.</p><p>Down I pushed.</p><p>Up he came.</p><p>Down.</p><p>Up.</p><p>Down.</p><p>&#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s going to win,&#x201d; Aunt Frances said.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhh, don&#x2019;t let him know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From the noises we just heard, I&#x2019;d say he already won the battle with the toilet paper.&#x201d;</p><p>In summer, I lived at a marina on a small houseboat, but Eddie and I moved to the boardinghouse after my aunt&#x2019;s guests were gone and the weather started to turn. Since then, Eddie had discovered that his new favorite toy was the roll of toilet paper in the kitchen&#x2019;s half bath. And to Eddie, a toy couldn&#x2019;t be a favorite unless he did his best to destroy it. Happily, toilet paper wasn&#x2019;t expensive. At least in small quantities.</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; I told the top of his head, &#x201c;even things that aren&#x2019;t expensive can get that way if you have to buy them new every day.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie had gone through bouts of destructiveness with paper products all summer long, and it looked as if the trend was going to continue. What he&#x2019;d be like in the winter, I didn&#x2019;t know, because I&#x2019;d only had Eddie since late April.</p><p>I&#x2019;d gone for a walk on an unseasonably warm day and found myself wandering through the local cemetery, enjoying the view of Janay Lake. My calm reverie had been broken by the appearance of a cat, who had materialized next to the gravesite of Alonzo Tillotson, born 1847, died 1926.</p><p>Though I&#x2019;d assumed the cat had a home and had tried to shoo him away, he&#x2019;d followed me back into town and charmed the socks off me by purring and rubbing up against my ankles.</p><p>I&#x2019;d taken him to the vet, where I&#x2019;d been told that my new friend was about two years old and needed ear drops. I&#x2019;d run a Found notice in the newspaper, but even though I&#x2019;d dutifully paid for a normal-sized advertisement instead of the tiny one I would have preferred, no one had called. Eddie was mine.</p><p>Or I was his. One of those.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop and stock up on my way home.&#x201d; I got up and took our dishes to the white porcelain sink, which was so old it was trendy again. I&#x2019;d seen similar ones in antiques stores selling for bizarrely large sums of money and realized that my aunt could make a fortune by taking the boardinghouse apart and selling it bit by bit. Of course, then she wouldn&#x2019;t have anywhere to live. Besides, she loved the place, despite its drafty windows and problematic plumbing. And so did I.</p><p>&#x201c;Do we need anything else from the store?&#x201d; There was no answer. I looked over my shoulder and saw Aunt Frances still sitting, her elbows planted on the old oak table, her chin in her hands and her gaze on Eddie.</p><p>My cat was sitting in the middle of the spot I&#x2019;d vacated. He was looking back at Aunt Frances with an intense, yellow-eyed stare. I knew that stare well, and it often meant trouble.</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; my aunt said in a faraway voice, &#x201c;I think it would be nice to get Eddie his own chair.&#x201d;</p><p>Trouble, my friends, right here in the boardinghouse kitchen.</p><p>I went back to the table and gave my feline friend a gentle push, sending him to the floor. Aunt Frances started to protest, but I shook my head. &#x201c;He got you again,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Beware of the power of the cat. He was trying to convince you to cater to his every whim, and he would have sucked you in if I hadn&#x2019;t interfered.&#x201d;</p><p>Aunt Frances laughed and got up from the table. I could tell she didn&#x2019;t quite believe me. Well, I didn&#x2019;t quite believe me, either, but what other explanation was there for lying awake in the middle of the night, desperately wanting to straighten your legs but not doing so because straightening them would disturb a cat&#x2019;s sleep? I also didn&#x2019;t believe that Eddie&#x2019;s brain grasped more than a handful of human words, but there were times when it seemed as if he understood life better than I did.</p><p>My aunt, being eight inches taller than I, was a much better candidate for putting away the dishes, so I washed while she dried.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get a card from Kristen yesterday?&#x201d; Aunt Frances asked.</p><p>I grinned. Indeed, I had. My best friend worked hard in her restaurant from spring through fall, then hightailed it south. The restaurant&#x2019;s closing date had more to do with the weather forecast than anything else, and she studied the early-snowfall predictions of the <i>Farmer&#x2019;s Almanac</i> all summer.</p><p>One mid-October morning, she&#x2019;d tromped into the library and flung herself into my office&#x2019;s guest chair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m out of here,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d announced.</p><p>I&#x2019;d glanced up from my computer. &#x201c;A little early, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t usually close the restaurant until the first week of November. Then she drove to Key West, where she tended bar on the weekends and did absolutely nothing during the week. Come spring, after I e-mailed her pictures of melted snow and ice-free lakes, she would return, refreshed and ready for another summer of hard work. It wasn&#x2019;t a life I would have wanted, but it suited her perfectly. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the rush?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>She slouched in the chair, sticking her long legs out into the middle of the room. At six foot, with straight blond hair, Kristen was my physical opposite. We were opposites in other ways, too, come to think of it, the most obvious of which was that I wasn&#x2019;t interested in cooking anything more complicated than canned soup, while about the only food Kristen didn&#x2019;t try to improve was an apple. And even then she&#x2019;d often slice it up, add a touch of lemon juice, and serve it with chunks of a cheese variety I couldn&#x2019;t pronounce.</p><p>&#x201c;Supposed to snow week after next,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve talked it over with the staff, and they&#x2019;re okay with closing down early. It was a good summer, but &#x2018;good&#x2019; means &#x2018;a lot of work.&#x2019; They&#x2019;re tired, and I don&#x2019;t want to push them.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t just her staff that was tired. I studied the droop of her broad shoulders and the fatigue scoring lines into her face.</p><p>&#x201c;What about Scruffy?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Last summer, I&#x2019;d accidentally started a romance between Kristen and Scruffy Gronkowski, a very nice man who was anything but untidy. He was the only person I knew under the age of sixty who took the time to iron creases into his pants, and he was also the producer of a cooking show that was occasionally filmed in Chilson because the host, Trock Farrand, owned a house nearby.</p><p>She grinned. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s at Trock&#x2019;s house, trying to figure out how to fit my restaurant into next year&#x2019;s schedule.&#x201d;</p><p>Jumping to my feet, I flung my arms out and ran to her, shrieking for joy all the way. She laughed and hugged me hard. &#x201c;Mid-July, he thinks, so it could be a nutso-busy zoo the rest of the summer.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristen&#x2019;s restaurant was doing well, but having it appear on a national cooking show could zoom it past the marginally profitable zone and into a place where she could think about hiring a manager. Not that she would&#x2014;she was too hands-on&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s a big difference between not wanting to and not being able to.</p><p>&#x201c;And how does Mr. Scruff feel about your Key West destination?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>She looked at me, all wide-eyed and innocent, a look she hadn&#x2019;t been able to pull off even when she had been innocent. &#x201c;Oh, I didn&#x2019;t tell you? He&#x2019;s planning to come down for Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>I whistled. Or tried to. Whistling wasn&#x2019;t one of my most developed skills. &#x201c;That sounds serious.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t go all wedding dress on me,&#x201d; Kristen said. &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s bad enough. Scruffy just hates the snow.&#x201d; And that was all she&#x2019;d say, no matter how sneaky I was about trying to get more information out of her.</p><p>The night before she left, we sat in her restaurant&#x2019;s empty kitchen, eating the last cr�me br�l�e in the place and drinking a bottle of her best champagne.</p><p>&#x201c;Postcards,&#x201d; she said suddenly.</p><p>Since we&#x2019;d been guessing how long the new downtown gift shop would last&#x2014;my estimate was less than a year&#x2014;I blinked at her. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Postcards. Key West is full of them.&#x201d; She topped off our glasses with more bubbly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send you a postcard every week.&#x201d; She smiled, showing her white teeth, and for a moment she bore a striking resemblance to a great white shark.</p><p>&#x201c;A Scruffy report?&#x201d; I asked. We&#x2019;d be e-mailing or texting practically every day, but the thought of getting a postcard in my mailbox was appealing.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. But only if I get Tucker updates.&#x201d;</p><p>The good-looking, blond, and tall (but not too tall) Dr. Tucker Kleinow and I had been dating since last summer. Though we&#x2019;d hit a stumbling block when we discovered his allergic reaction to cats in general and Eddie in particular, our relationship was progressing nicely, thanks to Tucker&#x2019;s willingness to take an allergy medication when he was Eddie-bound. &#x201c;Deal.&#x201d; I held up my glass, and we toasted our pact.</p><p>Now that I&#x2019;d received two postcards, I was realizing what had lain beneath her sharklike smile. Postcard number one had been a picture of blue skies and sandy beaches. On the back she&#x2019;d written <i>Key West, a steady eighty-one degrees. Chilson, forty-five and dropping. Sucker.</i></p><p>Aunt Frances had stuck it up with a thumbtack on the doorframe to the living room, where, in a few weeks, it would be surrounded by Christmas cards. She was amused by the whole thing and had been wondering if Kristen would keep it up all winter.</p><p>Now I nodded toward my backpack, which was sitting on the end of the kitchen counter. &#x201c;The new one&#x2019;s in the outside pocket. Go ahead and take it out.&#x201d;</p><p>Postcard number two had been a picture of blue skies and sandy beaches. On the back she&#x2019;d written <i>Key West, eighty degrees and sunny. Chilson, snow coming soon. Eww.</i></p><p>But Kristen knew that I didn&#x2019;t mind winter. I actually liked it. Soft and white, it transformed the world into something completely different, something fresh and clean and unexpected.</p><p>I stood there, my hands in the soapy water, daydreaming ahead to skiing and skating and snowshoeing. All sorts of activities that started with the letter <i>S</i> were done on a substance that also started with an <i>S</i>, namely snow, and&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrr!&#x201d;</p><p>I jumped. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said, nodding. &#x201c;We need to get going, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;</p><p>From his perch on my chair, Eddie looked straight at me. I didn&#x2019;t need a cat interpreter to know that he was saying, <i>Well, duh.</i></p><p>Aunt Frances returned the last bowl to the glass-front cabinets. &#x201c;Do you think Eddie would like a half wall? About so high&#x201d;&#x2014;she held her hand at waist level&#x2014;&#x201c;and about three feet long. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about taking out this door between the dining room and the kitchen for some time. It&#x2019;ll open up the space nicely. Maybe this is the year to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Smiling, I dried my hands on the blue-and-white hand towel. &#x201c;You think?&#x201d;</p><p>She eyed the area of interest. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a load-bearing wall. A sledge and a flat bar will take it down in no time. Then a little framing, a little drywall work, and a little trim. Shouldn&#x2019;t take long.&#x201d;</p><p>I snorted. &#x201c;Have you ever heard that story about the shoemaker&#x2019;s children&#x2014;you know, the ones who didn&#x2019;t have any shoes?&#x201d;</p><p>My loving aunt whirled her drying towel into a tight spiral and popped me lightly with the end of it. &#x201c;Out, you horrible child,&#x201d; she said, laughing. &#x201c;Out right now, or you&#x2019;ll be late for work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mrr.&#x201d;</p><p>And s...</p></p><h2>I Will Bear Witness 1942-1945: A Diary of the Nazi Years</h2><p>Destined to take its place alongside <b>The Diary of Anne Frank</b> and Elie Wiesel's <b>Night</b> as one of the great classics of the Holocaust, <b>I Will Bear Witness</b> is a timeless work of literature, the most eloquent and acute testament to have emerged from Hitler's Germany.

You sure you know where you're going?"<br><br>I ignored Robin Goodfellow as we wove through the gray murk of the wyldwood, pushing farther into the soggy swamp known as the Bone Marsh. Mud sucked at my footsteps, and water dripped from twisted green trees so covered in moss they appeared sheathed in slime. Mist coiled around the exposed roots or pooled in sunken areas, hiding what lay beneath, and every so often there was a splash in the still waters farther out, reminding us that we were not alone. As its name suggested, bones were scattered throughout the marsh, jutting out of the mud, half-hidden in tangles of weeds or shimmering beneath the surface of the water, bleached and white. This was a dangerous part of the wyldwood, more so than most&#x2014;not because of the catoblepas and the jabberwocks and other monsters that called the dark swamp their home, but because of the resident who lived somewhere deep within the marsh.<br><br>The one we were going to see.<br><br>Something flew past my head from behind, barely missing me, and spattered against a trunk a few feet away. Stopping beneath the tree, I turned and glared at my companion, silently daring him to do that again.<br><br>"Oh, hey, it lives!" Robin Goodfellow threw up his muddy hands in mock celebration. "I was afraid it had become a zombie or something." He crossed his arms and smirked at me, mud streaking his red hair and speckling his pointed face. "Did you hear me, ice-boy? I've been yelling at you for some time now."<br><br>"Yes," I said, repressing a sigh. "I heard you. I think the jabberwocks on the other side of the swamp heard you."<br><br>"Oh, good! Maybe if we fight a couple you'll start paying attention to me!" Puck matched my glare before gesturing around at the swamp. "This is crazy," he exclaimed. "How do we even know he's here? The Bone Marsh isn't exactly on my list of favorite vacation getaways, prince. You sure your contact knew what he was talking about? If this turns out to be another false lead I might turn that phouka into a pair of gloves."<br><br>"I thought you wanted an adventure," I said, just to annoy him. Puck snorted.<br><br>"Oh sure, don't get me wrong. I'm all for tromping to all five corners of the Nevernever, getting chased by angry Summer Queens, sneaking into an ogre's basement, fighting giant spiders, playing hide-and-seek with a cranky dragon&#x2014;good times." He shook his head, and his eyes gleamed, reliving fond memories. "But this is like the sixth place we've come to look for that wretched cat, and if he isn't here I'm almost afraid of where we're going next."<br><br>"You don't have to be here," I told him. "Leave if you want. I'm not stopping you."<br><br>"Nice try, prince." Puck crossed his arms and smiled. "But you're not getting rid of me that easily."<br><br>"Then let's keep moving." It was getting dark, and his constant chattering was getting on my nerves. Joking aside, I did not want to attract the attention of a hungry jabberwock and have to fight it in the middle of the swamp.<br><br>"Oh, fine," Puck sighed, tromping along behind me. "But if he's not here, I refuse to go to the Spider Queen's palace with you, ice-boy. That's where I draw the line."<br>My name, my full, True Name, is Ashallayn'darkmyr Tallyn, and I am the last son of the Unseelie Court.<br><br>There were three of us at one time, all princes of Winter, myself and my brothers, Sage and Rowan. I never knew my sire, never cared to know him, nor did my siblings ever speak of him. I wasn't even positive we shared the same sire, but it didn't matter. In the Unseelie Court, Mab was the sole ruler, the one and only queen. Handsome fey and even wayward mortals she might take to her bed, but Mab shared her throne with no one.<br><br>We were never close, my brothers and I. As princes of Winter, we grew up in a world of violence and dark politics. Our queen encouraged this, favoring the son who earned her good graces while punishing the others. We used each other, played vicious games against one another, but we were all loyal to our court and our queen. Or so I'd thought.<br><br>There is a reason the Winter Court freezes out their emotions, why feelings are considered a weakness and a folly among the Unseelie fey. Emotion corrupts the senses, makes them weak, makes them disloyal to kith and court. Jealousy was a dark, dangerous passion that ate at my brother Rowan until he did the unthinkable and turned on his court, betraying us to our enemies. Sage, my eldest sibling, fell to Rowan's treachery, and he was only the first. In a bid for power, Rowan sided with our greatest enemies, the Iron fey, helping their king nearly destroy the Nevernever. I killed Rowan in the end, avenging Sage and the rest of my kin, but retribution cannot bring either of them back. It's only me now. I am the last, the only remaining son of Mab, Queen of the Unseelie Court.<br><br>And I'm already dead to her.<br><br>Rowan was not the only one to succumb to emotion and passion. My fall began, as many stories do, with a girl. A girl named Meghan Chase, the half-human daughter of our ancient rival, the Summer King. Fate brought us together, and despite everything I did to shield my emotions, despite the laws of our people and the war with the Iron fey and the threat of eternal banishment from my home, I still found myself falling for her. Our paths were woven together, our fates intertwined, and before the last battle I swore I would follow her to the end of the world, to protect her from all threats, including my own kin, and to die for her if called to do so. I became her knight, and would have gladly served this girl, this mortal who had captured my heart, until the last breath left my body.<br><br>But Fate is a cruel mistress, and in the end, our paths were forced apart, as I'd feared they would be. Meghan became the Iron Queen, as was her destiny, and took the throne in the kingdom of the Iron fey. A place I could not follow, not as I am&#x2014;a faery creature whose essence weakens and burns at the touch of iron. Meghan herself exiled me from the lands of the Iron fey, knowing that staying would kill me, knowing I would try anyway. But before I left, I swore an oath that I would find a way to return, that someday we would be together, and nothing would separate us again. Mab tried to convince me to return to the Winter Court&#x2014;I was her only prince now, and it was my duty to come home&#x2014;but I bluntly stated that I was no longer part of the Unseelie Court, that my service to her and Winter was at an end.<br><br>There is nothing more terrible than a spurned faery queen, particularly if you defy her a second time. I escaped the Winter Court with my life intact, but just barely, and I won't be returning anytime soon. Regardless, I feel little regret at turning my back on my queen, my kith and my home. That part of my life is done. My loyalty&#x2014;and my heart&#x2014;belongs to another queen now.<br><br>I promised I'd find a way for us to be together. I intend to keep that promise. Even if it means trekking through a sprawling, deadly marsh in search of a rumor. Even if it means putting up with my fiercest and most annoying rival, Robin Goodfellow, who&#x2014;despite all his attempts to hide it&#x2014;is in love with my queen as well. I don't know why I haven't killed him yet. Maybe because Puck is Meghan's closest friend, and she would mourn him terribly if he were gone (though I can't understand why). Or, maybe, deep down, I'm tired of being alone.<br><br>In any case, it matters little. With every ruin we search, every dragon we slay, or every rumor we unearth, I'm one step closer to my goal. Even if it takes a hundred years, I will be with her in the end. Another piece of the puzzle lurks somewhere in this dreary swampland. The only difficulty lies in finding it.<br>Thankfully, despite Puck's constant griping and complaining, the jabberwocks decided <em>not</em> to see what the racket was about and come stalking through the marsh to find us. That was just as well, because it took nearly the whole night to find what we were looking for.<br><br>At the edge of a scummy pond stood a house, faded and gray like everything else. A picket fence made of bleached white bones surrounded it, naked skulls topping the posts, and a few scraggly chickens milled about in what passed as a yard. The hut was old and wooden, creaking faintly though there was no wind. The most unusual thing, however, wasn't the house itself, but what held it up. It stood on a pair of massive bird legs, gnarled and yellow, blunt talons digging into the mud. The legs were crouched low, as if sleeping, but every so often they shifted restlessly, causing the whole house to shudder and groan.<br><br>"We're heeeeere," Puck sang softly. "And can I say that the old gal hasn't gotten any less creepy than when I saw her last."<br><br>I narrowed my eyes at him. "Just shut up and let me do the talking this time. It was bad enough when you insulted the centaur chief."<br><br>"All I suggested was that we could've used a ride out of the meadow. I didn't mean from <em>him"</em><br><br>Sighing, I opened the bone gate and crossed the weed-choked yard, scattering chickens in front of me. Before we reached the steps, however, the door creaked open and an old woman emerged from the darkened interior. Tangled white hair framed a lined, wrinkled face, and sharp black eyes peered out at us, bright and gleaming. In one gnarled hand she held a basket, in the other a butcher knife, stained with the blood of many victims.<br><br>I stopped at the foot of the stairs, wary and alert. Old as she appeared, the witch of this house was powerful and unpredictable. If Puck said something stupid or accidentally insulted her, it would be vastly annoying if we had to fight our way out.<br><br>"Well," the witch said, curling bloodless lips to smile at us. Crooked yellow teeth flashed in the light like jagged bits of bone. "What do we have here? Two handsome faery boys, come to visit a poor old woman. And if my eyes don't deceive me, that's Robin Goodfellow I see before me. The last I saw of you, you stole my broom and tied my house's legs so it fell over when we tried to catch you!"<br><br>I repressed another sigh. This wasn't starting well. I should've known Puck had already done something to earn her wrath. But at the same time, I had to fight the urge to smile, to laugh at such a ridiculous thought, the house falling on its face in the mud because the Great Prankster had tied its feet together.<br><br>I kept my expression neutral, as it was obvious the witch was not amused in the slightest. "What do you have to say for yourself, villain?" she continued, shaking her butcher knife at Puck, who ducked behind me in a pathetic attempt to hide, though I could hear him trying to muffle his laughter. "Do you know how long it took me to repair my home? And then you have the gall, the absolute gall, to leave my broom at the edge of the forest, just to prove you could take it. I've half a mind to stick you in the pot and feed you to my chickens!"<br><br>"I apologize for him," I said quickly, and those sharp black eyes suddenly turned on me. I held myself tall, unafraid but still polite, lest she lump me together with the buffoon at my back. "Excuse this intrusion, old mother," I continued formally. "I am Ash of the Unseelie Court. And I need your help, if you would hear me."<br><br>The witch blinked. "Such manners. You were not raised in a barn like that one, I see." She stabbed her knife in Puck's direction, wrinkling her long nose. "And I know who you are, son of Mab. What would you have of me? Be quick about it."<br><br>"We're looking for someone," I said. "He was rumored to be traveling through here, through the Bone Marsh. We thought you might know where he is."<br><br>"Oh?" The witch cocked her head, giving me a scrutinizing look. "And what makes you think I know where this person is?"<br><br>"Not a person," I corrected. "A cat. A cait sith. In some tales he's known as Grimalkin. And in some tales he's been rumored to keep company with a powerful witch out in the swamps, whose house stands on chicken legs in a fence made of bones."<br><br>"I see," said the witch, though her face and voice remained expressionless. "Well, I admire your tenacity, young prince. Grimalkin is not easy to find in the best of times. You must have come very far to seek him out." She peered closely at me, narrowing her eyes. "And this is not the first place you have searched. I can see it on your face. Why, I wonder? Why does he come so far? What is it that he desires so badly, to risk the ire of the Bone Witch? What is it you want, Ash of the Winter Court?"<br><br>"Would you believe the cat owes him money?" Puck's voice came from behind my shoulder, making me wince. The witch scowled at him.<br><br></p><h2>Understanding the Faith: A Survey of Christian Apologetics (Volume 1) (Understanding the Times)</h2><p><b>Does the Bible have authority in a world committed to relative truth?</b><br><br> The understanding of absolute, objective truth has been largely lost.

Goldy&#x2019;s chatty approach to crime and cooking has many fans, and this will find a receptive audience among the Joanne Fluke crowd. --Stephanie Zvirin</p><h2>Nerdlandia</h2><p>A hip, funny, Latino rendition of Grease, this play features three cool muchachos who come to the aid of Martin, a chicano nerd who loves a beautiful, popular girl, Ceci, from afar.With the help of his friends, Martin changes his miage and impresses Ceci and her friends, without letting on who he is.

Martin tries to be one of the homies in order to win his idealized love, Ceci. Ironically, Ceci has just ended her relationship with her two-timing boyfriend and now decides that a sweet, intelligent guy like Martin is just what she needs. She, in turn, tries to become more nerdlike to win his affections, which includes shopping at "Nerdstroms." Language is a parody of street slang and Spanish phrases.

In one of modern history&#x2019;s most miraculous occurrences, communism imploded&#x2013;and not with a bang, but with a whimper. Now two of the foremost scholars of East European and Soviet affairs, Stephen Kotkin and Jan T. Gross, drawing upon two decades of reflection, revisit this crash. In a crisp, concise, unsentimental narrative, they employ three case studies&#x2013;East Germany, Romania, and Poland&#x2013;to illuminate what led Communist regimes to surrender, or to be swept away in political bank runs. This is less a story of dissidents, so-called civil society, than of the bankruptcy of a ruling class&#x2013;communism&#x2019;s establishment, or &#x201c;uncivil society.&#x201d; The Communists borrowed from the West like drunken sailors to buy mass consumer goods, then were unable to pay back the hard-currency debts and so borrowed even more. In Eastern Europe, communism came to resemble a Ponzi scheme, one whose implosion carries enduring lessons. From East Germany&#x2019;s pseudotechnocracy to Romania&#x2019;s megalomaniacal dystopia, from Communist Poland&#x2019;s cult of Mary to the Kremlin&#x2019;s surprise restraint, Kotkin and Gross pull back the curtain on the fraud and decadence that cashiered the would-be alternative to the market and democracy, an outcome that opened up to a deeper global integration that has proved destabilizing.</p><p>Stephen Kotkin is Rosengarten Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Princeton University, with a joint appointment as Professor of International Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School.

Gradually and then suddenly.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises<br><br></i>The wry Romanian film <i>A fost sau n- a fost? </i>(2006), known in En -&nbsp;glish as <i>12:08 East of Bucharest, </i>poses a seemingly passe question:&nbsp;Was there or was there not&#x2014;&#x201c;A fost sau n- a fost?&#x201d;&#x2014;a revolution in&nbsp;1989? Most of the film takes place at a desk, as an on- air discussion&nbsp;inside a television studio. (It is often said that Romania&#x2019;s 1989 events&nbsp;took place mostly on TV.) The pompous host (who is given to quoting&nbsp;Herodotus) is called Virgil Jderescu, a provincial TV station&nbsp;owner whose talk show is called <i>Issue of the Day. </i>This particular day is&nbsp;December 22, 2005, and the issue is what happened on the same date&nbsp;sixteen years earlier. After some potential panelists bow out, Jderescu&nbsp;goes live with a debt- ridden, alcoholic history teacher named Tiberiu&nbsp;M&#x222b;nescu and a grumpy, lonely pensioner named Emanoil Piscoci&nbsp;who dresses up as Santa Claus for children. The telecast backdrop&nbsp;shows the live image of a drab, unnamed Stalinist- style wide town&nbsp;square (thought to be Vaslui, the eastern Romanian hometown of the&nbsp;film&#x2019;s director, Corneliu Porumboiu). The film&#x2019;s nonaction is riveting:&nbsp;three men sitting in chairs. Jderescu keeps asking &#x201c;Was there, or&nbsp;was there not, a revolution in our town?&#x201d; M&#x222b;nescu recounts how on&nbsp;December 22, 1989, he had gone to their town square with three&nbsp;other teachers&#x2014;conveniently, two are now dead and one departed&nbsp;for Canada&#x2014;before 12:08 p.m., as part of a protesting vanguard. The&nbsp;timing is crucial because Nicolae Ceauoescu, the Romanian dictator,&nbsp;fled Bucharest by helicopter precisely at that time. The Santa Claus&nbsp;impersonator claims that he, too, went to the square, albeit after&nbsp;12:08. Jderescu takes a call to the show: it&#x2019;s the sentry on duty in the&nbsp;town square sixteen years ago, who denounces as a lie M&#x222b;nescu&#x2019;s&nbsp;claim to have been on the square before 12:08. Another caller places&nbsp;M&#x222b;nescu at the corner bar drinking the whole day and night. As&nbsp;callers along with the host impugn M&#x222b;nescu&#x2019;s story, the latter interjects,&nbsp;&#x201c;Why split hairs over such stupidity?&#x201d; The broadcast winds&nbsp;down by depicting&#x2014;live on the studio backdrop&#x2014;forlorn gray buildings, a darkening sky, streetlights turning on, and beautiful snow&nbsp;falling. The last phone- in caller says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just calling to let you know&nbsp;it&#x2019;s snowing outside. It&#x2019;s snowing big white flakes. Enjoy it now, tomorrow&nbsp;it will be mud . . . Merry Christmas, everybody!&#x201d; The woman&nbsp;reveals that she lost her son on December 23, 1989, the day after the&nbsp;revolution.&nbsp;<br><br>The film seems to examine whether a revolution can take place if&nbsp;no one risks anything, at least in this town, and it seems to reinforce a&nbsp;general impression that Romania in 1989 was the grand exception.&nbsp;Romania, it is often said, was the only Eastern European country&nbsp;whose experience in 1989 was supposedly a coup, not a revolution. Or&nbsp;it is said that Romania did have a revolution, but it was stolen.1 Adding&nbsp;to this sense of exceptionalism, Romania turned out to be the only&nbsp;country besides Yugoslavia where socialism&#x2019;s end was bloody. That&nbsp;carnage notwithstanding&#x2014;officially Romania suffered 1,104 dead,&nbsp;mostly after December 22&#x2014;it will be our argument that Romania in&nbsp;1989 was not an exception but part of a continuum that includes East&nbsp;Germany as well as most other cases. Communist Romania had a&nbsp;minuscule opposition. It was a country of Tiberiu M&#x222b;nescus and&nbsp;Emanoil Piscocis, as well as Virgil Jderescus, but, as we shall see, Romania&nbsp;offers a fine example of what could be called nonorganized&nbsp;mobilization, which in 1989 was actually the norm across Eastern Europe.&nbsp;It was Communist- era Poland, usually taken as paradigmatic,&nbsp;that proved to be the grand exception. In Poland, the opposition was&nbsp;not a small coterie of dissidents or groups of people arrayed around&nbsp;private kitchen tables, taking advantage of the mass construction of&nbsp;self- contained (noncommunal) apartments to commiserate in trusted&nbsp;company. The opposition in Poland was societal, with organizations&nbsp;and physical spaces, Sunday sermons and flying universities, and a&nbsp;fully articulated alternative to the regime.2 Yet Romania, not Poland,&nbsp;experienced large street protests in 1989. That year, East Germany,&nbsp;too, had massive street demonstrations, even though, as in Romania,&nbsp;there was relatively little organized opposition.&nbsp;Back in the 1970s, most commentators thought that the capitalist&nbsp;<br><br>West, not communism, was nearing collapse, and even in the second&nbsp;half of the 1980s, Communist systems seemed not doomed but uncertain. Unexpectedly, however, 1989 turned out to be an <i>annus</i>&nbsp;<i>mirabilis, </i>producing revolutions in Eastern Europe that sparked&nbsp;repercussions around the globe, from apartheid South Africa to&nbsp;one- party Mexico. The Romanian case, like the East German one,&nbsp;indicates that much of the interpretive challenge consists in analyzing&nbsp;how East European Communist regimes fell in the absence of&nbsp;organized oppositions. This requires a different understanding of&nbsp;social process from the usual invocation of something called &#x201c;civil&nbsp;society.&#x201d; The latter slogan has proved to be catnip to scholars, pundits,&nbsp;and foreign aid donors.3 After &#x201c;modernization theory&#x201d; (the hugely influential&nbsp;1950s&#x2013;1970s developmental ideology) had morphed by&nbsp;the 1980s into &#x201c;democracy promotion,&#x201d; the notion of &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;&nbsp;became the conceptual equivalent of the &#x201c;bourgeoisie&#x201d; or &#x201c;middle&nbsp;class&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, a vague, seemingly all- purpose collective social actor.4&nbsp;It was claptrap. Several hundred (sometimes just several dozen)&nbsp;members of an opposition&#x2014;with a handful of harassed illegal associations&nbsp;and underground self- publications (<i>samizdat</i>)&#x2014;were somehow&nbsp;a &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;? Meanwhile, <i>hundreds of thousands </i>of party and&nbsp;state officials, political police operatives, army officers&#x2014;who often&nbsp;went to school, worked, and even lived together, controlled all (state)&nbsp;property, public spaces, communications networks, and institutions,&nbsp;and had their own clubs, resorts, and shops&#x2014;were somehow not a&nbsp;society?&nbsp;<br><br>Such widespread misapprehension transpires when normative&nbsp;thinking&#x2014;imagining how things ought to be&#x2014;gets the better of&nbsp;analysis. Needless to say, in 1989 &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; could not have shattered&nbsp;Soviet- style socialism for the simple reason that civil society in&nbsp;Eastern Europe did not then actually exist. The mostly small groups&nbsp;of dissidents, however important morally, could not have constituted&nbsp;any kind of society. On the contrary, it was the establishment&#x2014;the&nbsp;&#x201c;uncivil society&#x201d;&#x2014;that brought down its own system. Each establishment&nbsp;did so by misruling and then, when Mikhail Gorbachev&#x2019;s&nbsp;Kremlin radically shifted the geopolitical rules, by capitulating&#x2014;or&nbsp;by refusing to capitulate and thus making themselves susceptible to&nbsp;political bank runs.5 Suddenly, decades of bravery by disparate dissidents&#x2014;&nbsp;the moral thunderbolts, the &#x201c;antipolitics,&#x201d; the &#x201c;living in dignity&#x201d;&#x2014;were swamped by a cascade of activism on the part of formerly&nbsp;inert masses and by elite opportunism. Would- be totalitarian&nbsp;states, which aspired to total control and total mobilization, by the&nbsp;same token proved to be totally vulnerable.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Civil Society Utopias&nbsp;<br></i><br>Whence the reverie of &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;? Before the eighteenth century,&nbsp;the terms &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; and &#x201c;the state&#x201d; were nearly synonymous and&nbsp;meant essentially political society. But Adam Ferguson (1723&#x2013;1816),&nbsp;along with other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, helped divide&nbsp;the two terms into an opposition (a process continued by G. W. F.&nbsp;Hegel and Alexis de Tocqueville). Ferguson&#x2019;s <i>Essay on the History of&nbsp;Civil Society </i>(Edinburgh, 1767) contrasted a civilized rule- of- law society&nbsp;to a barbarous one. His text came out in eight editions up to&nbsp;1819, but the next English edition had to wait until 1966. Not long&nbsp;thereafter, the term &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; would again burst into vogue, especially&nbsp;among analysts awestruck by the breakthrough of Solidarity&nbsp;in Communist- ruled Poland.6 Suddenly, individuals and groups&nbsp;around Eastern Europe that opposed Communist systems were said&nbsp;to constitute an emergent civil society&#x2014;that is, &#x201c;autonomous&#x201d; forces&nbsp;outside the state and, in these instances, against the state. Such recourse&nbsp;to the concept of &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; in fact exaggerated the role of&nbsp;intellectuals (at the expense of workers, churches, and the world&nbsp;economy).7 More consequentially, the supposed mutual exclusiveness&nbsp;of civil society and state produced a skewed characterization of&nbsp;society in terms of how a society was (self- )organized. True, social&nbsp;organization is not to be taken for granted; it must be achieved, and&nbsp;sustained. But a society is also profoundly shaped by how the state is&nbsp;organized.8 &#x201c;Civil society&#x201d; was in many ways the conceptual counterpart&nbsp;to the concept of totalitarianism, but if it was precisely the&nbsp;all- encompassing totalitarian despotism that made the term &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;as something outside the state&#x2014;so appealing, this very system&nbsp;also did not permit anything like a civil society to exist.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Civil society,&#x201d; if it means anything, signifies people taking responsibility for themselves. That, however, requires the ability not&nbsp;just to self- organize but also to have recourse to state institutions to&nbsp;defend associationism, civil liberties, and private property. Obviously,&nbsp;dissidents living under Soviet- style systems could not attain&nbsp;that, no matter how brave they were, because of the nature of the&nbsp;Communist state. Founded on the suppression of private property&nbsp;and &#x201c;bourgeois&#x201d; rule of law, the Communist state lacked indepen -&nbsp;dent judiciaries, civil services, and independent media to help defend&nbsp;<i>against </i>state power. To be sure, determined individuals could appeal&nbsp;to international norms and laws, especially the 1975 Helsinki &#x201c;basket&nbsp;three&#x201d; human rights obligations signed by Communist regimes. And&nbsp;many of them cited the Communist regimes&#x2019; own constitutions. On&nbsp;December 5, 1965, Soviet &#x201c;Constitution Day,&#x201d; the mathematician&nbsp;Aleksander Esenin- Volpin organized a rally on Moscow&#x2019;s Pushkin&nbsp;Square of around two hundred people and held up a sign reading&nbsp;&#x201c;Respect the Constitution.&#x201d; (He was promptly arrested.) Less quixotically,&nbsp;in Poland from the 1970s such a strategy&#x2014;designed as a decisive&nbsp;break from any attempt to reform socialism&#x2014;did become a&nbsp;powerful form of social organization, in a kind of self- fulfilling&nbsp;prophecy. &#x201c; &#x2018;We&#x2019;re supposed to be citizens!&#x2019; we thought,&#x201d; recalled the&nbsp;late historian and Solidarity activist Bronis&#x221e;aw Geremek in an interview&nbsp;in 2007. &#x201c;Even the socialist constitution of the Polish People&#x2019;s&nbsp;Republic refers to citizens&#x2019; place in society, and we wanted society to&nbsp;belong to the citizens. And that was our organizing utopia. If there&nbsp;was any sort of utopia in &#x2018;Solidarity,&#x2019; it was the utopia of civil society.&#x201d;&nbsp;9 Elsewhere in the bloc, however, this practice of living <i>as if </i>one&nbsp;constituted a civil society had limited organizing effects, even as&nbsp;utopia.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Civil society,&#x201d; explained the Hungarian novelist and essayist&nbsp;Gy\rgy Konrad (1933&#x2013;) in 1984, &#x201c;is still only an idea.&#x201d;10 That characterization&nbsp;held right through 1989. East Germany&#x2019;s &#x201c;New Forum,&#x201d;&nbsp;a very loose umbrella for various groups, was first announced only on&nbsp;September 21, 1989. Fair or not, it was no Solidarity (an independent&nbsp;labor union of 10 million members). True, some 3,000 people signed&nbsp;New Forum&#x2019;s founding appeal straight away, and more than 200,000&nbsp;people eventually signed, but New Forum played little role in the&nbsp;events of 1989; it vanished soon thereafter.11 Czechoslovakia&#x2019;s Civic<i>&nbsp;</i>Forum took shape in November 1989, partly in response to East&nbsp;German events, such as the occupation of the West German embassy&nbsp;in Prague by East Germans clamoring to go west, but also in response&nbsp;to the beatings of peaceful Czechoslovak student demon -&nbsp;strators. (Civic Forum&#x2019;s Slovak counterpart was Public Against&nbsp;Violence.) Civic Forum seemed liked an update of the rights movement&nbsp;Charter 77 (which had not aspired to become a mass movement),&nbsp;but Civic Forum did not even have a program. As late as the&nbsp;beginning of 1989, the Czechoslovak security service estimated the&nbsp;country&#x2019;s active dissidents at no more than 500 people, with a core&nbsp;of about 60 (a count similar to East Germany&#x2019;s).12 Meanwhile, on&nbsp;Prague&#x2019;s Wenceslas Square some 10,000 people massed on October&nbsp;28, 1989, and 200,000 people on November 19; eight days later, a&nbsp;general strike of some one million people shut down the country. But&nbsp;none of this was inspired or led by dissidents or Civic Forum, which&nbsp;was abolished not long after 1989. In other words, the socialmovement&nbsp;analogies to Poland&#x2019;s mesmerizing Solidarity have been&nbsp;profoundly misleading, falsely generalizing a successful strategy in&nbsp;one special case to others.Romania in 1989 lacked even a New Forum or a Civic Forum&nbsp;from which to try to make false analogies to Poland, but consider&nbsp;Hungary, which is often placed alongside Poland because in 1989&nbsp;Hungary, too, had a regime- opposition &#x201c;roundtable.&#x201d; As Andras Sajo&nbsp;has written, however, Hungary in 1989 saw few street protests and&nbsp;little popular mobilization, and &#x201c;the Hungarian opposition was&nbsp;rather isolated and few in number.&#x201d; The Hungarian roundtable&#x2014;&nbsp;300 sessions, 500 participants, three months&#x2014;began as a kind of&nbsp;regime self- negotiation (which had been going on internally for&nbsp;years).14 From 1985, Hungary&#x2019;s state trade unions and party youth&nbsp;group had begun to shrink and one third of Hungarians&#x2019; working&nbsp;time was being spent in the private sector for services, but the key&nbsp;factor leading up to 1989 in Hungary was that many Communists&nbsp;lost interest in preserving their own system. Not all, but a number, of&nbsp;party officials preferred to become an asset- owning bourgeoisie.15&nbsp;An even more substantial number had come to favor a multiparty&nbsp;political system. Whatever the motivations, the Communist faction<i>&nbsp;</i>seeking an exit from the Communist monopoly system pressured&nbsp;hard- liners, while also assisting reform circles in society. In short, elements&nbsp;in the party worked to fortify the loose anti- Communist opposition.&nbsp;Someone had to be on the other side of the table when the&nbsp;Hungarian roundtable opened six days after the June 4, 1989, elections&nbsp;in Poland. Moreover, even in Poland, as we shall see, the roundtable&nbsp;had to be launched by the regime.&nbsp;<br><br>...</p><h2>The Rifleman</h2><p><b>A gripping, fact-based story of how Daniel Morgan and his courageous riflemen played a crucial role in George Washington&#x2019;s victory in the American Revolution.&nbsp;</b><br><br>They wore hunting shirts, deer-skin leggins and moccasins.

This volume introduces Thrush Green, the neighboring village to Fairacre: its blackthorn bushes, thatch-roofed cottages, enchanting landscape, and jumble sales. Readers will delight in a new cast of characters and also welcome familiar faces as they become immersed in the village&#39;s turn of events on one pivotal day -- May Day. Before the day is over, life and love and perhaps eternity will touch the immemorial peace of the village.</p><p><p><b>Miss Read</b> (1913-2012) was the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.&nbsp;</p>June Barrie's warm alto voice and ability to create character add to the many pleasures of this delightful novel by England's premier writer of rural pastorals. Here we follow the loves, rivalries, misfortunes, and joys of the inhabitants of neighboring villages. It's an apparently simple story that is both wise and honest, and it is clear that Barrie appreciates its subtleties. From ill-tempered grave digger to love-stricken young lady, her portrayals are beautifully rendered. This is a book in which not much--except life in its quotidian fascination--happens. Barrie keeps one glued to the earphones.

Anthony and Gloria are the essence of Jazz Age glamour. A brilliant and magnetic couple, they fling themselves at life with an energy that is thrilling. New York is a playground where they dance and drink for days on end. Their marriage is a passionate theatrical performance; they are young, rich, alive and lovely and they intend to inherit the earth. But as money becomes tight, their marriage becomes impossible. And with their inheritance still distant, Anthony and Gloria must grow up and face reality; they may be beautiful but they are also damned.</p><p>This edition includes a detailed account of the composition of the novel, a textual apparatus, a chronology of composition, and, uniquely, three versions of the ending. Explanatory notes situate The Beautiful and Damned in its times and deepen the reader&#39;s understanding of Fitzgerald&#39;s sources for the novel.Following the great critical and financial success of his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald published <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> in 1922. An immediate success upon its first publication, Fitzgerald's second novel is a dazzling portrait of love and life among the beautiful people. Through the story of two newlyweds, Anthony Patch of New York and Gloria Gilbert of Kansas City, Fitzgerald flawlessly captures the heady atmosphere and jaded values of the Jazz Age. Patch, expecting to become the sole heir to his grandfather's millions, embraces a life of endless parties and intellectual pretensions. In Gloria, he finds an exquisite ornament and a passionate lover. The couple whirls through days that mirror Fitzgerald's own--a fast life amid a smart set for which there is never enough cash. Beginning with wit and clever repartee, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> quickly becomes a scathing chronicle of a dying marriage and a hedonistic society where beauty is all too fleeting. Through the character of Richard Caramel, a successful hack writer whose talent fails as he prospers, Fitzgerald caricatures himself. But today's readers will find an even more poignant self-portrait of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda in Anthony and Gloria, a couple whose days of wine and roses fade quickly toward a tragic end.</p><h2>Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World</h2><p>In this classic work, now updated, the author of <i>Culture and Imperialism </i>reveals the hidden agendas and distortions of fact that underlie even the most "objective" coverage of the Islamic world.<br><br>From the Iranian hostage crisis through the Gulf War and the bombing of the World Trade Center, the American news media have portrayed "Islam" as a monolithic entity, synonymous with terrorism and religious hysteria. At the same time, Islamic countries use "Islam" to justify unrepresentative and often repressive regimes. Combining political commentary with literary criticism,&nbsp;<i>Covering Islam</i> continues Edward Said's lifelong investigation of the ways in which language not only describes but also defines political reality.</p><p>While the 16 years that have passed since the first edition of this book hit the stands have been marked by an increase in sensitivity toward many ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities, the easy acceptance of stereotypes and prejudices in the portrayal, depiction of, and reporting about Islamic peoples has remained largely constant. In this updated version of this rigorous but engaging volume Edward Said looks at how American popular media has used and perpetuated a narrow and unfavorable image of Islamic peoples, and how this has prevented understanding while providing a fictitious common enemy for the diverse American populace.In this landmark work, for which he has written a new Introduction, one of our foremost public thinkers examines to origins and repercussions of the media&#39;s monolithic images of Islam. Combining political commentary with literary criticism, Edward Said reveals the hidden assumptions and distortions of fact that underlie even the most &#34;objective&#34; coverage of the Islamic world. In so doing, Covering Islam continues Said&#39;s lifelong investigation of the ways in which language not only describes but also defines political reality.</p><h2>Rupture: An Ari Thor Thriller (The Dark Iceland Series, 4)</h2><p><p><b>A huge bestseller in England, France, and Australia, the fourth book in the Ari Thor thriller series from a spectacular new crime writer. </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Hailed for combining the darkness of Nordic Noir with classic mystery writing, author Ragnar Jonasson&#x2019;s books are haunting, atmospheric, and complex.<i> Rupture</i>, the latest Ari Th�r thriller, delivers another dark mystery that is chillingly stunning with its complexity and fluidity.</p><p>Young policeman Ari Th�r tries to solve a 50-year-old murder when new evidence surfaces.

Julia quickened her pace, trying to keep her skirts from dragging along the muddy ground, and at the same time shield her face from the persistent drizzle of cold autumn rain. If she didn't reach the Capital Theatre soon, her hair and clothes would be soaked. "My audition," she muttered despairingly, shouldering past the people on the broken, slippery sidewalk. A once-jaunty yellow feather drooped down from the brim of her small hat, and she pushed it back impatiently. </p><p>Today was one of the most important days of her life. If all went well, she might become part of the most successful acting company in England. However, if she failed to impress Logan Scott with her talents, she would have to return to the grimy little Daly Theatre in the Strand. The manager there, Mr. Bickerston, regarded the actresses as if they were prostitutes, turning a profit for himself by arranging for them to meet wealthy men. He was furious with Julia for refusing to associate with a lecherous old baron who had been willing to pay an exorbitant fee for the privilege of bedding her. "You'll obey my rules," Bickerston had spat at her, "or you're no longer in the company. The next time I find a man for you, you'll accept him or be damned!" </p><p>To make matters worse, Bickerston had a gambling problem, and he often couldn't pay the actors the full amount of their salaries. If Julia didn't make money soon, she wouldn't be able to afford the terrace room she had rented. And she couldn't resort to what the other actresses did, selling their sexual favors to supplement their income. For her that would never be a choice, even if she starved. </p><p>Julia sighed, her skin crawling at the thought of returning to the Strand. She had to find a better place to work. Tightening her grip on the damp sheaf of paper in her arms, she lowered her head and walked faster. All of a sudden she rammed into a hard object that nearly sent her sprawling backward. The stack of papers cascaded from her arms. Only a man's quick grab at her shoulders kept her from falling onto the muddy pavement. </p><p>"Are you all right, miss?" the man inquired, steadying her. </p><p>Julia bent to scoop up her sodden papers. To her dismay, the hem of her skirts dragged through a dirty puddle. "You should watch where you're going," she exclaimed. </p><p>"I might say the same to you, miss." The man's voice was as dry and rich as a glass of red wine. He helped her to retrieve the fallen papers, pausing to glance at them. </p><p>took them from him before he had the chance to read anything. "I'm on my way to an audition," she said crisply. "I'm very late." She began to walk past him, but he stopped her with a light touch on her shoulder. </p><p>"Which theater do you want?" </p><p>She looked up at him, blinking as a rain-laced breeze swept over her face. He was tall and wellbuilt, his wide shoulders covered with a heavy black coat. Through the veil of rain dripping from the brim of his dark hat, she could see blunt, attractive features and a pair of intense blue eyes. "I'm trying to find the Capital," she said. </p><p>"You've reached it." He indicated a nearby doorway. "That leads to the greenroom, where auditions are usually held." </p><p>"How do you know that?" she asked suspiciously. </p><p>A smile pulled at the corner of his wide, mobile mouth. "I'm a member of the company." </p><p>"Oh." She was taken aback, and a touch envious. Lucky, lucky man, to be a part of such a prestigious group. </p><p>His smile remained as he contemplated her. "If you wish, I'll show you the way." </p><p>Julia nodded and cautiously preceded him through the doorway into a quiet, dim hallway. Relieved to be out of the rain, she brushed at her damp skirts and tried to straighten them. Politely her companion waited until she removed her dripping hat and cloak, and he took them from her. "We'll leave these in a spare dressing room to dry," he said, opening a door and hanging the articles on the large brass hooks affixed to the wall. He removed his own hat and coat, and ran his fingers through his disheveled hair, trying to bring order to the short, wavy mass. </p><p>Julia smoothed her own dark hair, wishing she had a mirror to help restore her appearance. </p><p>"You look well enough," the man said, as if reading her thoughts. </p><p>For the first time, Julia smiled at him tentatively. "I was hoping for something better than that." </p><p>He shrugged. "Your looks won't matter as much as your acting skill." </p></p><h2>The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789 (Oxford History of the United States)</h2><p>The first book to appear in the illustrious <em>Oxford History of the United States</em>, this critically acclaimed volume--a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize--offers an unsurpassed history of the Revolutionary War and the birth of the American republic.<br><br>Beginning with the French and Indian War and continuing to the election of George Washington as first president, Robert Middlekauff offers a panoramic history of the conflict between England and America, highlighting the drama and anguish of the colonial struggle for independence. Combining the political and the personal, he provides a compelling account of the key events that precipitated the war, from the Stamp Act to the Tea Act, tracing the gradual gathering of American resistance that culminated in the Boston Tea Party and "the shot heard 'round the world." The heart of the book features a vivid description of the eight-year-long war, with gripping accounts of battles and campaigns, ranging from Bunker Hill and Washington's crossing of the Delaware to the brilliant victory at Hannah's Cowpens and the final triumph at Yorktown, paying particular attention to what made men fight in these bloody encounters. The book concludes with an insightful look at the making of the Constitution in the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 and the struggle over ratification. Through it all, Middlekauff gives the reader a vivid sense of how the colonists saw these events and the importance they gave to them. Common soldiers and great generals, Sons of Liberty and African slaves, town committee-men and representatives in congress--all receive their due. And there are particularly insightful portraits of such figures as Sam and John Adams, James Otis, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and many others. <br><br>This new edition has been revised and expanded, with fresh coverage of topics such as mob reactions to British measures before the War, military medicine, women's role in the Revolution, American Indians, the different kinds of war fought by the Americans and the British, and the ratification of the Constitution. The book also has a new epilogue and an updated bibliography.<br><br>The cause for which the colonists fought, liberty and independence, was glorious indeed.

Middlekauff is both elegant and eloquent. Whether he is describing the making of British policy, or sketching the character of Washington or Pitt, or explaining why Daniel Morgan positioned the American troops at Hannah's Cowpens so retreat would be impossible, he does in a few paragraphs or pages what others might struggle through a chapter to get right."--<em>The New Republic</em> <br> <br>"A first-class narrative history. There is probably no history of the Revolution that better combines a full account of the military course of the war with consideration of all the other forces shaping the era." --<em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Middlekauff's energy and clarity often make us read as eagerly as if we did not know how this struggle will come out."--<em>The New Yorker</em> <br> <br> "Writing with a grace and clarity that recall Samuel Eliot Morison, Middlekauff gives us classic entry into the critical period of American history." --<em>The Los Angeles Times</em> <br> <br>"His narrative account goes along at a fast pace.

Hoy, II), THE MCGRAW-HILL BOOK OF POETRY, THE MCGRAW-HILL BOOK OF FICTION, THE SCRIBNER HANDBOOK FOR WRITERS (with Pat C. Hoy, II), WRITING ABOUT THE HUMANITIES, LITERATURE: AN INTRODUCTION, MODERN AMERICAN PROSE, and, among others MODERN AMERICAN POETS: THEIR VOICES AND VISIONS (a text to accompany the PBS television series). He updated the fourth edition of Strunk and White&#39;s classic ELEMENTS OF STYLE, and he has co-authored ARTS AND CULTURE: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMANITIES (Prentice Hall), the basis for their lecture series on art and literature given at New York&#39;s Metropolitan Museum of Art."Another innovative feature is the authors' genuine effort to integrate reading with writing. Too often, anthologies--whether rhetorical readers or lit-for-comp texts--do little more than pay lip service to the reading-writing connection. In FM, the connection is made explicit by the "Occasions," which walk students step-by-step through a process of discovery, showing them how to use the "mode" in question as a means of moving from invention through analysis toward formulating a thesis and developing a full paper. Very few textbooks provide this kind of detailed, explicit--and imaginative--writing pedagogy."<br><br>"The innovative ways in which Hoy and DiYanni have resurrected "conventional" patterns of development and arrangement is important to composition studies-and to students of writing. In the preface to FRAMES OF MIND the editors make clear that they make use of these familiar patterns to add "richness and complexity" to student writing, not to impose rigid, old ways of thinking and writing. And they do this remarkably."</p><h2>Student Edition 2018 (Psychology)</h2><p>Brand new copy, Ships from NY</p><p></p><h2>Nikon D3100 For Dummies</h2><p><b>Unlock all the secrets of the powerful new Nikon D3100 DSLR camera</b> <p>Author Julie King knows how to teach newbies, and in this handy guide she?ll help you get the very most out of the powerful new Nikon D3100.

Writing anonymously as Mary Westmacott, she also wrote about crimes of the heart, a series of six bittersweet novels with a jagged edge, as compelling and memorable as the best of her work.Writing as Mary Westmacott, Agatha Christie reveals a very different side. The six Westmacott novels, written between 1930 and 1956, feature more introspective plots and greater character development. But Christie is still Christie--even under a pen name her works make keen observations about people and the conflicts that arise between them. In this novel, Joan Scudamore reflects upon her life and her family while stranded between trains. Ann Beach illuminates Joan's growing acceptance of the uncomfortable truths of her life. The cutting remarks of her friend Blanche are delivered in the tones of the not-so-well-meaning friend. Well-defined secondary characters add warmth and realism to the story as Beach captures an East Indian railroad servant with a high, singsong voice and sketches Joan's fellow traveler, Princess Sasha, with a refined European accent. This quiet story speaks volumes about the underside of family relationships.

Following a tantalizing trail of archaeological, chemical, artistic, and textual clues, Patrick E. McGovern, the leading authority on ancient alcoholic beverages, brings us up to date on what we now know about how humans created and enjoyed fermented beverages across cultures. Along the way, he explores a provocative hypothesis about the integral role such libations have played in human evolution. We discover, for example, that the cereal staples of the modern world were probably domesticated for their potential in making quantities of alcoholic beverages. These include the delectable rice wines of China and Japan, the corn beers of the Americas, and the millet and sorghum drinks of Africa. Humans also learned how to make mead from honey and wine from exotic fruits of all kinds-even from the sweet pulp of the cacao (chocolate) fruit in the New World. The perfect drink, it turns out-whether it be mind-altering, medicinal, a religious symbol, a social lubricant, or artistic inspiration-has not only been a profound force in history, but may be fundamental to the human condition itself.</p><p>"Patrick McGovern has written his masterpiece. He takes us on an engrossing, multifaceted journey through the complex relationships between human cultures and alcoholic beverages of all kinds. In doing so, he develops a new context for human history." Brian Fagan, author of <i>The Great Warming </i>and <i>Fish on Friday</i><br><br>"Fascinating, wide-ranging and erudite.

Tom Standage, author of <i>A History of the World in 6 Glasses</i> and <i>An Edible History of Humanity</i><br><br> In <i>Uncorking the Past,</i> Patrick E. McGovern charts the enchantment of human beings with alcoholic beverages from their initial discoveries of fermented honey, fruits, and grains to the perfection of elaborate means for producing, storing, transporting, and consuming treasured spirits. McGovern's gaze is truly global, spanning all the continents, but it is also microscopic, penetrating to neural pathways, genes, and molecules.

In seven wonderfully integrated parts, different aspects of human existence are magnified and reduced, reordered and emphasized, newly examined, analyzed, and experienced.</p></p><p>In one of the finer modern ironies of the life-imitates-art sort, the country that Kundera seemed to be writing about when he talked about Czechoslovakia is, thanks to the latest political redefinitions, no longer precisely there. This kind of disappearance and reappearance is, partly, what Kundera explores in <i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i>.

In 1993, former KGB officer Alexander Vassiliev was permitted unique access to Stalin-era records of Soviet intelligence operations against the United States. Years later, living in Britain, Vassiliev retrieved his extensive notebooks of transcribed documents from Moscow.&nbsp;With these notebooks John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr have meticulously constructed a new, sometimes shocking, historical account.</p><p>Along with general insights into espionage tactics and the motives of Americans who spied for Stalin, <i>Spies</i> resolves specific, long-seething controversies. The book confirms, among many other things, that Alger Hiss cooperated with Soviet intelligence over a long period of years, that journalist I. F. Stone worked on behalf of the KGB in the 1930s, and that Robert Oppenheimer was never recruited by Soviet intelligence. <i>Spies</i> also uncovers numerous American spies who were never even under suspicion and satisfyingly identifies the last unaccounted for American nuclear spies. Vassiliev tells the story of the notebooks and his own extraordinary life in a gripping introduction to the volume.</p></p><p><b>John Earl Haynes</b> is a modern political historian in the Manuscript Division, the Library of Congress.

When students are not well prepared academically and also lack academic literacy skills, the challenge can seem overwhelming. Fortunately, the Freemans</i> <i>help secondary content-area teachers provide these students with the academic support they very desperately need.</i> <b>-Robert J. Marzano</b> Coauthor of <i>Building Academic Vocabulary</i> Many middle school and high school students are recent immigrants or long-term English language learners who struggle with the academic language needed to read content-area textbooks and write papers for their classes. Likewise, many native speakers of English find content-area classes a challenge. Secondary teachers have little time to teach academic reading and writing skills because they must cover a great deal of content in their social studies, science, math, or language arts classes. <i>Academic Language for English Language Learners and Struggling Readers </i>provides the information busy secondary teachers need to work effectively with English learners and struggling readers. It reports current research to answer key questions: <ul> <li>Who are our older English language learners and struggling readers? </li><li>What is academic language? </li><li>How can middle and high school teachers help students develop academic language in the different content areas? </li></ul> This comprehensive and readable text by Yvonne and David Freeman (authors of <i>Essential Linguistics</i>) synthesizes recent demographic data on the kinds of English language learners and struggling readers who attend middle and high schools in increasing numbers. They flesh out the statistics with stories of students from different backgrounds. Then the Freemans examine academic language at different levels: the text level, the paragraph level, the sentence level, and the word level. For each, they provide examples of academic language and specific strategies teachers can use as they teach language arts, science, math, and social studies. They also analyze content-area textbooks, pointing out the difficulties they pose for students and suggesting ways to make texts more accessible to ELLs and struggling readers. Providing classroom examples, the Freemans explain how teachers can motivate and engage their students. They describe how teachers can teach language and content simultaneously by developing both language and content objectives. <i>Academic Language for English Language Learners</i> gives teachers the information and strategies they need to help all their students develop academic language.</p><p><p>Yvonne S.

In this concise and accessible account of the invention and development of digital technology, computer historian Paul Ceruzzi offers a broader and more useful perspective. He identifies four major threads that run throughout all of computing's technological development: digitization&#x2015;the coding of information, computation, and control in binary form, ones and zeros; the convergence of multiple streams of techniques, devices, and machines, yielding more than the sum of their parts; the steady advance of electronic technology, as characterized famously by &#x201c;Moore's Law&#x201d;; and the human-machine interface.</p><p>Ceruzzi guides us through computing history, telling how a Bell Labs mathematician coined the word &#x201c;digital&#x201d; in 1942 (to describe a high-speed method of calculating used in anti-aircraft devices), and recounting the development of the punch card (for use in the 1890 U.S. Census). He describes the ENIAC, built for scientific and military applications; the UNIVAC, the first general purpose computer; and ARPANET, the Internet's precursor. Ceruzzi's account traces the world-changing evolution of the computer from a room-size ensemble of machinery to a &#x201c;minicomputer&#x201d; to a desktop computer to a pocket-sized smart phone. He describes the development of the silicon chip, which could store ever-increasing amounts of data and enabled ever-decreasing device size.

Hartle provides a fluent and accessible introduction that uses a minimum of new mathematics and is illustrated with a wealth of exciting applications. The emphasis is on the exciting phenomena of gravitational physics and the growing connection between theory and observation. The Global Positioning System, black holes, X-ray sources, pulsars, quasars, gravitational waves, the Big Bang, and the large scale structure of the universe are used to illustrate the widespread role of how general relativity describes a wealth of everyday and exotic phenomena.</p></p><p><p> <b>James B.

Five themes recur throughout the Economics in Our Times Program: 1) Economics play a large part in local state national and world events and it is important for the well-educated student to understand this. 2) Economics consists not just of a list of topics (e.g. inflation unemployment monetary and fiscal policy etc.) or even a set of tools; essentially it is a way of thinking students can use to examine critically and understand more fully the world they live in. 3) The student who learns about supply and demand the role of prices opportunity cost costs and benefits externalities the law of diminishing marginal utility and much more that economics has to offer will never again look at the world in the same way;they will have a sharper focus. 4) Economics is presented as a truly social science that not only informs students of facts and issues they will encounter in the business world but also the ideas and issues they will deal with as citizens of the world. 5) Consumer economics should be a part of every student&#39;s education. Economics in Our Times takes the position that informed and responsible consumers sellers saver workers and employers don&#39;t just happen; they are educated to be who they are.</p><p>Ph.D. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</p><h2>The Inner Bonding Workbook: Six Steps to Healing Yourself and Connecting with Your Divine Guidance</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Inner Bonding has been a staple in my own personal journey home to wholeness.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Alanis Morissette, artist, activist, and teacher</b></p><p>Take responsibility for every aspect of your life, love yourself unconditionally, and connect to your own divine guidance using the life-changing six-step process outlined in this breakthrough guide, from the best-selling author and cocreator of the Inner Bonding� self-healing process.</p><p>Many of us long for spiritual connection and divine guidance&#x2014;the wisdom and ability to make decisions that benefit ourselves and the greater good.

First, &#34;The Double&#34;, a surprisingly modern hallucinatory nightmare that foreshadows Kafka and Sartre. A minor official named Goliadkin becomes aware of a mysterious doppelganger - a man who has his name and his face and who gradually and relentlessly begins to displace him with his friends and colleagues. In the dilemma of his increasingly paranoid hero, Dostoevsky makes vividly concrete the inner plurality of consciousness that would become a major theme of his work. Second, &#34;The Gambler&#34;, a stunning psychological portrait of a young man&#39;s exhilarating and destructive addiction, a compulsion that Dostoevsky - who once gambled away his wife&#39;s wedding ring - knew intimately from his own experience. In the disastrous love affairs and gambling adventures of Alexei Ivanovich, Dostoevsky explores the irresistible temptation to look into the abyss of ultimate risk that he believed was an essential part of the Russian national character.</p><p>Hesperus Press, as suggested by their Latin motto, <i>Et remotissima prope,</i> is dedicated to bringing near what is far&#x2014;far both in space and time.

In farfetched allusions to problems overcome by Sitting Bull, the authors urge politicians, CEOs and public services chiefs to emulate the Sioux leader's qualities--commitment, integrity, courage, statesmanship and vision--qualities successfully employed by executives of the few firms cited here. Murphy and Snell propose three phases of action divided into 13 steps: to restore the nation's confidence, to mobilize its resources and to develop Sitting Bull-like leadership. Murphy is a business consultant; Snell is a book developer and literary agent. 40,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Grandmother Fish: A Child&#39;s First Book of Evolution</h2><p><p>Where did we come from? </p><p>It's a simple question, but not so simple an answer to explain&#x2015;especially to young children.

Highly recommended for homes, schools, and libraries." &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>"With simple text and vibrant, cheerful illustrations, this picture book offers a lively, accessible introduction to the theory of evolution to younger children. Opening with Grandmother Fish, who 'lived a long, long, long, long, long time ago' and could wiggle and chomp, the text continues with direct-address questions ('Can you wiggle?'), which encourage animated read-alouds and active participation, as well as bold-type key terms. Grandmother Fish had many 'grandchildren,' like Grandmother Reptile, who could wiggle, chomp, and crawl . . . and breathe air. In similar fashion, readers progressively meet Grandmother Mammal, Grandmother Ape, and, eventually, Grandmother Human (who could walk and talk), whose grandchildren can do all that and more. The enthusiastic narrator then says, 'I see one of them right here!' and the accompanying illustration depicts a diverse group of smiling kids and adults. Though this is a complicated topic, the simplified presentation, cumulative format, and scrutiny-inviting visuals nicely illustrate evolutionary connections and provide a great starting point for further discussions. Back matter, geared toward adults, offers information on the book&#x2019;s content and suggestions to help further explain concepts." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"A dynamite job . . . gorgeously illustrated . . . <i>Grandmother Fish </i>is a fun way to start children down a path of scientific literacy and, what's more, can help instill in them a vital sense of connection with the living world." &#x2015;NPR</p><p>"Another GeekMom sent this to me and I fell in love.

The wild ride begins during her nurse training years in the 1960s, when laboring women were expected to lie down, shut up, and submit to whatever drugs and procedures the doctor ordered. A rebellious patient who chants and dances through her contractions--and the hell that ensues when seasoned hospital staffers intrude--lights a permanent fire under Vincent. Her resolve to serve each laboring woman with compassion and respect carries her from obstetrics nurse to head of an alternative birth center within Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, California, and eventually into her own private practice as a licensed midwife. Like the most courageous home births, this collection of delivery experiences refuses anesthesia: plenty of bellowing, sweating, bleeding, and pushing accompany nearly all of the more than 40 tales. Tough confrontations with stubborn physicians, panicky labor partners, and one particularly nasty calico cat are dabbed with as many keen insights as Vincent's quieter, more heart-rending newborn encounters. <i>Baby Catcher</i> is an inspirational literary gift suitable for expectant mothers, fellow baby catchers, and anyone who loves reading about nature's greatest magical feat. <i>--Liane Thomas</i>In 1980, after fifteen years as a delivery room nurse, ten years as a natural childbirth teacher, and three years as the director of the first alternative birth center in the East Bay, <b>Peggy Vincent</b> became a licensed midwife specializing in homebirths. Five years later, she became the first completely independent nurse midwife to receive hospital privileges in the Berkeley area.

He is the&nbsp;bestselling author of <em>Through the Eyes of a Lion, Swipe Right,&nbsp;</em>and <em>I Declare War</em>. Levi also travels the world speaking about&nbsp;Jesus. He and his wife, Jennie, have one son, Lennox, and four&nbsp;daughters: Alivia, Daisy, Clover, and Lenya, who is in heaven.&nbsp;</p>I believe with my whole heart that Swipe Right is going to inspire and challenge you, and not only that, but could redirect the course of your life and relationships. You might not be in a relationship, or maybe you&#x2019;ve had many, but no matter who you are, my husband wrote this book for you. The truth, hope, and humor that drip from these pages are incredible. It&#x2019;s a book that needed to be written, my husband poured his heart into it, and I&#x2019;m excited for all that God has for you as you read it. Buckle up. (<i>&#x2015;Jennie Lusko</i>)<br><br>My friend Levi is an expert at presenting the raw truth in a relevant way. In Swipe Right he provides a refreshingly real approach to the new challenges our culture is facing concerning sex and intimacy. It&#x2019;s a perspective I believe we need now more than ever. (<i>&#x2015;Steven Furtick Pastor, Elevation Church, and New York Times bestselling author</i>)<br><br>One day, someday, there will be a day where you will need the down-to-earth wisdom in this book like you will oxygen. Because as Levi so aptly appropriates, our approach to sex and romance is of life-and-death importance---at least if you care at all about your soul, that hidden thing at the core of who we are that filters the way we experience everything we do in life and death, for better or for worse. And at the core of this book is a soul-watering desire to see yours be better, in a world that increasingly seems to be settling for worse. Levi makes the taboo seem candid, the old-school the new-school, and the difficult more than just possible but altogether life-saving. (<i>&#x2015;Joel Houston Songwriter, Hillsong United, and pastor, Hillsong NYC</i>)<br><br>I love that Levi is bringing to light the life-and-death power of sex and romance for such a time as this. I have two daughters, and there is a new level of crazy lately in the world. You should thank God that this book is in your hands. Swipe Right is a timely, wonderful, prophetic, and needed message for our generation. (<i>&#x2015;Christine Caine Founder of the A21 Campaign and bestselling author of Unashamed</i>)<br><br>Helpful. Timely. Needed. Swipe Right does what few dating books can: it calls us to a life of purity, fidelity, and honor, not in hopes of earning the perfect mate, but because we already have the hope of heaven and perfection of Jesus in our hearts. I am so grateful God has raised up Levi Lusko to be a voice of truth and grace-covered conviction for this generation. If you are wondering what God&#x2019;s plans are for your love life, or leading those in search of his plan for theirs, you need this book. (<i>&#x2015;Louie Giglio Pastor of Passion City Church, founder of Passion Conferences, and author of The Comeback</i>)<br><br>Sex is wonderful. Sex is powerful. According to Levi, while sex is the source of great pleasure, it has the potential to cause great pain. In Swipe Right Levi leverages his past as well as principles from the New Testament to help readers make better decisions and live with fewer regrets. (<i>&#x2015;Andy Stanley Pastor, North Point Community Church, and author of Deep and Wide: Creating Churches Unchurched People Love to Attend</i>)<br><br>When it comes to sex, dating, and marriage, most of us would agree things aren&#x2019;t going well. We want something different, something better. Levi Lusko has written a game-changing book on pursuing the relationship God truly wants you to have. His book Swipe Right: The Life-and-Death Power of Sex and Romance is funny and engaging, while simultaneously practical and hard-hitting. It&#x2019;s full of in-your-face truth that will empower you to love your future spouse in a healthy and God-honoring way. (<i>&#x2015;Craig Groeschel Pastor of Life.Church and author of From This Day Forward: Five Commitments to Fail Proof Your Marriage</i>)<br><br>I wish this book had been around in 1970. I wish someone had handed it to a fifteen-year-old kid in West Texas. I wish someone had said to him, &#x2018;Lucado, quit listening to the locker room lectures on sex. Listen to what God says.&#x2019; The book wasn&#x2019;t around back then, but it is here today. And Levi Lusko has a good word, not just for fifteen-year-old boys but for all of us to suffer the consequences of a sex-saturated society. This is a good book. Study it, ponder it, and, if you know a fifteen-year-old, tell them to read it. (<i>&#x2015;Max Lucado New York Times bestselling author</i>)<br><br>In a cultural climate that attempts to treat the sacred nature of relationship and sexual intimacy as casual, Levi Lusko has yielded his pen to God&#x2019;s hand to share what is paramount on God&#x2019;s heart. Swipe Right is the clarion call this generation needs in order to understand that God is not keeping you from a thing; he&#x2019;s keeping you for a thing. The lie of the enemy is that we can easily recover from premature sexual intimacy without incident. A loving God knows otherwise. With love, balance, wit, and humor, Levi has crafted a book that will inform generations to come. This book isn&#x2019;t about ceasing external behaviors that don&#x2019;t honor God. It&#x2019;s about living for God and loving God in a way where we honor his word---even regarding sex---when it is not convenient. And we do so because we love him! (<i>&#x2015;John Gray Associate teaching pastor, Lakewood Church, and author of I Am Number 8</i>)<br><br>Thank God for people like Levi Lusko who are dedicated to bringing light to the issues that we all face. Swipe Right is an inspirational look at love, sex, and romance and highlights what our generation so often misses. I believe this resource will help many to understand the true power and true beauty God intends for us in these important areas of life.

And more often than we realize, that face is wearing lipstick.</b><br><br><i>Autism in Heels</i>, an intimate memoir, reveals the woman inside one of autism&#x2019;s most prominent figures, Jennifer O'Toole. At the age of thirty-five, Jennifer was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and for the first time in her life, things made sense. Now, Jennifer exposes the constant struggle between carefully crafted persona and authentic existence, editing the autism script with wit, candor, passion, and power. Her journey is one of reverse-self-discovery not only as an Aspie but--more importantly--as a thoroughly modern woman.<br><br>Beyond being a memoir, <i>Autism in Heels</i> is a love letter to all women.

And a firsthand account of what it is to walk in Jennifer's shoes (especially those iconic red stilettos).<br><br>Whether it's bad perms or body image, sexuality or self-esteem, Jennifer's is as much a human journey as one on the spectrum. Because autism "looks a bit different in pink," most girls and women who fit the profile are not identified, facing years of avoidable anxiety, eating disorders, volatile relationships, self-harm, and stunted independence. Jennifer has been there, too. <i><b>Autism in Heels</b></i> takes that message to the mainstream.<br><br>From her own struggles and self-discovery, she has built an empire of empowerment, inspiring women the world over to realize they aren't mistakes.

The Restless Passenger</p> <p>It all came about by pure chance! The previous day, Maigret had not known that he was about to go on a journey, even though it was the time of year when he usually began to find Paris oppressive. It was a March spiced up with a foretaste of spring and a clear, sharp sun that was already warm.</p> <p>Madame Maigret was away in Alsace for a couple of weeks, staying with her sister, who was having a baby.</p> <p>On the Wednesday morning, the inspector received a letter from a former colleague who had retired from the Police Judiciaire two years earlier and moved to the Dordogne.</p> <p> </p><p> <i>... And of course, if you happen to be in the area, do come and stay with me for a few days. I have an elderly housekeeper who is only too happy when there are guests to fuss over. And it&#x2019;s the start of the salmon season&#x2014;</i> </p> <p></p> <p>Maigret&#x2019;s imagination was particularly fired by the letterhead with its drawing of a manor house flanked by two circular towers above the address:</p> <p> </p><p> <i>La Ribaudi�re</i> </p> <p> <i>near Villefranche-en-Dordogne</i> </p> <p></p> <p>At midday, Madame Maigret telephoned from Alsace to say that her sister would probably give birth that night, adding, &#x2018;You&#x2019;d think it was summer ... The fruit trees are in blossom!&#x2019;</p> <p>Chance ... Pure chance ... A little later, Maigret was in the chief&#x2019;s office, chatting, when his superior said, &#x2018;By the way ... Did you ever go to Bordeaux to follow up that matter we talked about?&#x2019;</p> <p>It was a minor case of no urgency. At some point, Maigret had to go to Bordeaux to trawl through the municipal records.</p> <p>One idea led to another: Bordeaux ... the Dordogne.</p> <p>At that exact moment, a ray of sunlight struck the crystal globe paperweight on the chief&#x2019;s desk.</p> <p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s a thought! I&#x2019;m not working on anything at the moment.&#x2019;</p> <p>Later that afternoon, having purchased a first-class ticket to Villefranche, Maigret boarded the train at the Gare d&#x2019;Orsay. The guard reminded him to change trains at Libourne.</p> <p>&#x2018;Unless you&#x2019;re in the sleeper compartment which gets hitched to the connecting train.&#x2019;</p> <p>Maigret thought no more about it, read a few newspapers and made his way to the dining car where he sat until ten o&#x2019;clock.</p> <p>When he returned to his compartment, he found the curtains drawn and the light dimmed. An elderly couple had commandeered both seats.</p> <p>An attendant walked past.</p> <p>&#x2018;Is there a free bunk by any chance?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Not in first-class ... but I think there&#x2019;s one in second ... If you don&#x2019;t mind&#x2014;&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Of course not!&#x2019;</p> <p>And Maigret lugged his carpet-bag along the corridors. The attendant opened several doors and finally found the compartment in which only the upper bunk was taken.</p> <p>Here too, the light was dimmed and the curtains drawn.</p> <p>&#x2018;Would you like me to switch on the light?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;No thank you.&#x2019;</p> <p>The air was warm and stuffy. There was a faint hissing sound, as if there was a leak in the radiator pipes. Maigret could hear the person in the top bunk tossing and turning and breathing heavily.</p> <p>The inspector silently removed his shoes, jacket and waistcoat. He stretched out on the lower bunk and felt a slight draught coming from somewhere. He picked up his bowler hat and put it over his face for protection.</p> <p>Did he fall asleep? He dozed off, in any case. Perhaps for an hour, perhaps two. Perhaps longer. But he remained half conscious.</p> <p>And, in that semi-conscious state, he was aware of a feeling of discomfort. Was it because of the heat battling with the draught?</p> <p>Or was it because of the man in the top bunk, who couldn&#x2019;t keep still for a second? He tossed and turned continually, just above Maigret&#x2019;s head. Every movement made a rustling sound.</p> <p>His breathing was irregular, as if he had a fever.</p> <p>After a time, Maigret got up, exasperated, went into the corridor and paced up and down. But there it was too cold.</p> <p>So it was back into the compartment, and another attempt to sleep, his thoughts and sensations befuddled by drowsiness.</p> <p>Cut off from the rest of the world, the atmosphere was that of a nightmare.</p> <p>Had the man above him just raised himself up on his elbows and leaned over to try and get a look at his companion?</p> <p>Maigret, meanwhile, didn&#x2019;t dare move. The half-bottle of Bordeaux and the two brandies he had drunk in the dining car lay heavy in his stomach.</p> <p>The night was long. Whenever the train stopped at a station, there was a babble of voices, footsteps in the corridors, doors slamming. It felt as if the train would never get going again.</p> <p>It sounded as if the man was crying. There were moments when he held his breath. Then suddenly, there&#x2019;d be a snivel and he would turn over and blow his nose.</p> <p>Maigret regretted leaving his first-class compartment occupied by the elderly couple.</p> <p>He dozed off, woke up and drifted off again. Finally, unable to stand it any longer, he coughed to steady his voice and said, &#x2018;Monsieur, would you kindly try to keep still!&#x2019;</p> <p>He felt embarrassed, because his voice sounded much sterner than he had intended. Supposing the man was ill?</p> <p>There was no answer. The tossing and turning stopped. The man must have been making a huge effort to avoid making the slightest sound. And it suddenly occurred to Maigret that it might not be a man after all, but a woman! He hadn&#x2019;t seen the person who was wedged between the bunk and the ceiling.</p> <p>And the heat must be suffocating up there. Now Maigret tried to turn down the radiator, but the control knob was jammed.</p> <p>It was three o&#x2019;clock in the morning.</p> <p>&#x2018;I really must get some sleep!&#x2019;</p> <p>Now he was wide awake. He had become almost as jumpy as his fellow passenger.

The story of the mythological king, who is doomed to kill his father and marry his mother, has resonated in world culture for almost 2,500 years. But Sophocles&#x2019; drama as originally performed was much more than a great story&#x2014;it was a superb poetic script and exciting theatrical experience. The actors spoke in pulsing rhythms with hypnotic forward momentum, making it hard for audiences to look away. Interspersed among the verbal rants and duels were energetic songs performed by the chorus.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Mulroy&#x2019;s brilliant verse translation of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> recaptures the aesthetic power of Sophocles&#x2019; masterpiece while also achieving a highly accurate translation in clear, contemporary English. Speeches are rendered with the same kind of regular iambic rhythm that gave the Sophoclean originals their drive. The choral parts are translated as fluid rhymed songs. Mulroy also supplies an introduction, notes, and appendixes to provide helpful context for general readers and students.Considered by many the greatest of the classic Greek tragedies, <i>Oedipus Rex</i> is Sophocles' finest play and a work of extraordinary power and resonance. Aristotle considered it a masterpiece of dramatic construction and refers to it frequently in the <i>Poetics</i>.<br>In presenting the story of King Oedipus and the tragedy that ensues when he discovers he has inadvertently killed his father and married his mother, the play exhibits near-perfect harmony of character and action. Moreover, the masterly use of dramatic irony greatly intensifies the impact of the agonizing events and emotions experienced by Oedipus and the other characters in the play. Now these and many other facets of this towering tragedy may be studied and appreciated in Dover's attractive inexpensive edition of one of the great landmarks of Western drama.<br>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.</p><h2>College Physics, 7th Edition (Available 2010 Titles Enhanced Web Assign)</h2><p>Open the door to the fascinating world of physics!

These schools have been around just as long as their bucolic not-for-profit counterparts, yet shockingly little is known about why they have expanded so rapidly in recent years&#x2014;during the so-called Wall Street era of for-profit colleges.<br><br>In <i>Lower Ed</i> Tressie McMillan Cottom&#x2014;a bold and rising public scholar, herself once a recruiter at two for-profit colleges&#x2014;expertly parses the fraught dynamics of this big-money industry to show precisely how it is part and parcel of the growing inequality plaguing the country today. McMillan Cottom discloses the shrewd recruitment and marketing strategies that these schools deploy and explains how, despite the well-documented predatory practices of some and the campus closings of others, ending for-profit colleges won&#x2019;t end the vulnerabilities that made them the fastest growing sector of higher education at the turn of the twenty-first century. And she doesn&#x2019;t stop there.<br><br>With sharp insight and deliberate acumen, McMillan Cottom delivers a comprehensive view of postsecondary for-profit education by illuminating the experiences of the everyday people behind the shareholder earnings, congressional battles, and student debt disasters. The relatable human stories in <i>Lower Ed</i>&#x2014;from mothers struggling to pay for beauty school to working class guys seeking &#x201c;good jobs&#x201d; to accomplished professionals pursuing doctoral degrees&#x2014;illustrate that the growth of for-profit colleges is inextricably linked to larger questions of race, gender, work, and the promise of opportunity in America.<br><br>Drawing on more than one hundred interviews with students, employees, executives, and activists, <i>Lower Ed</i> tells the story of the benefits, pitfalls, and real costs of a for-profit education.

Building on the works of Morand, Marinetti, and McLuhan, Virilio presents a vision more radically political than that of any of his French contemporaries: speed as the engine of destruction. Speed and Politics presents a topological account of the entire history of humanity, honing in on the technological advances made possible through the militarization of society. Paralleling Heidegger's account of technology, Virilio's vision sees speed&#x2015;not class or wealth&#x2015;as the primary force shaping civilization. In this "technical vitalism," multiple projectiles&#x2015;inert fortresses and bunkers, the "metabolic bodies" of soldiers, transport vessels, and now information and computer technology&#x2015;are launched in a permanent assault on the world and on human nature.

George Orwell&#39;s story of Winston Smith&#39;s fight against the all-pervading party has become a classic, not the least because of its intellectual coherence.</p><p>"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere."<p> The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.</p><p> Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.</p><p> <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i>, <i>thoughtcrime</i>--in <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary. More importantly, he has portrayed a chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance. <i>--Daniel Hintzsche</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Interprofessional Health Care Team: Leadership and Development</h2><p>The Interprofessional Health Care Team: Leadership and Development explores theoretical concepts of leadership in an interdisciplinary health care environment and provides practical examples of these concepts from the perspective of health care scholars, scientists, faculty, and health administration professionals.

Invaluable for the insight they give into the daily life of the poet and his friendship with Coleridge, they are also remarkable for their spontaneity and immediacy, and for the vivid descriptions of people, places, and incidents that inspired some of Wordsworth's best-loved poems. <em>The Grasmere Journal</em> was begun at Dove Cottage in May 1800 and kept for three years. Dorothy notes the walks and the weather, the friends, country neighbors and beggars on the roads; she sets down accounts of the garden, of Wordsworth's marriage, their concern for Coleridge, the composition of poetry. The earlier <em>Alfoxden Journal</em> was written during 1797-8, when the Wordsworths lived near Coleridge in Somerset. Not intended for publication, but to "give Wm Pleasure by it," both journals have a quality recognized by Wordsworth when he wrote of Dorothy that "she gave me eyes, she gave me ears."<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

That moment was the culmination of Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s long mission to undermine Western democracy, a mission that he and his hand-selected group of oligarchs and Mafia kingpins had ensnared Trump in, starting more than twenty years ago with the massive bailout of a string of sensational Trump hotel and casino failures in Atlantic City. This book confirms the most incredible American paranoias about Russian malevolence. <br><br>To most, it will be a hair-raising revelation that the Cold War did not end in 1991&#x2014;that it merely evolved, with Trump&#x2019;s apartments offering the perfect vehicle for billions of dollars to leave the collapsing Soviet Union. In <i>House of Trump, House of Putin</i>, Craig Unger methodically traces the deep-rooted alliance between the highest echelons of American political operatives and the biggest players in the frightening underworld of the Russian Mafia. He traces Donald Trump&#x2019;s sordid ascent from foundering real estate tycoon to leader of the free world. He traces Russia&#x2019;s phoenix like rise from the ashes of the post&#x2013;Cold War Soviet Union as well as its ceaseless covert efforts to retaliate against the West and reclaim its status as a global superpower. <br><br>Without Trump, Russia would have lacked a key component in its attempts to return to imperial greatness. Without Russia, Trump would not be president. This essential book is crucial to understanding the real powers at play in the shadows of today&#x2019;s world. The appearance of key figures in this book&#x2014;Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, and Felix Sater to name a few&#x2014;ring with haunting significance in the wake of Robert Mueller&#x2019;s report and as others continue to close in on the truth.</p><p><b>Craig Unger&nbsp;</b>is the author of six books, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>House of Bush, House of Saud</i>, and&nbsp;<i>House of Trump, House of Putin</i>.<b> </b>For fifteen years he was a contributing editor of <i>Vanity Fair</i> where he covered national security, the Middle East, and other political issues.

Unger has written about the Trump Russia scandal for <i>The New Republic,</i> <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and <i>The Washington Post.</i> He is a graduate of Harvard University and lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br> <b>(VIRTUAL) WORLD WAR III</b><br> &nbsp;<br> At approximately 9:32 a.m. Moscow time on November 9, 2016, Deputy Vyacheslav Nikonov of the pro-Putin United Russia Party stepped up to the microphone in the Russian State Duma, the Russian equivalent of the House of Representatives, to make a highly unusual announcement.<br><br> The grandson of Vyacheslav Molotov&#x2014;the coolly ruthless Stalinist of Molotov cocktail fame&#x2014;Nikonov had been involved in Soviet and Russian politics for roughly forty years, including serving a stint on Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s staff. Now, he was about to make a rather simple, understated announcement, that in its way was as historic and incendiary as anything his grandfather had ever done.<br><br> &#x201c;Dear friends, respected colleagues!&#x201d; Nikonov said. &#x201c;Three minutes ago Hillary Clinton admitted her defeat in US presidential elections and a second ago Trump started his speech as an elected president of the United States of America and I congratulate you on this.&#x201d;<br><br> Even though Nikonov did not add what many in the Kremlin already knew, his brief statement was greeted by enthusiastic applause. Donald J. Trump had just become Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s man in the White House.<br><br> This book tells the story of one of the greatest intelligence operations in history, an undertaking decades in the making, through which the Russian Mafia and Russian intelligence operatives successfully targeted, compromised, and implanted either a willfully ignorant or an inexplicably unaware Russian asset in the White House as the most powerful man on earth. In doing so, without firing a shot, the Russians helped put in power a man who would immediately begin to undermine the Western Alliance, which has been the foundation of American national security for more than seventy years; who would start massive trade wars with America&#x2019;s longtime allies; fuel right-wing anti-immigrant populism; and assault the rule of law in the United States.<br><br> In short, at a time at which the United States was confronted with a new form of warfare&#x2014;hybrid war consisting of cyber warfare, hacking, disinformation, and the like&#x2014;the United States would have at its helm a man who would leave the country all but defenseless, and otherwise inadvertently do the bidding of the Kremlin.<br><br> It is a story that is difficult to tell even though, in many ways, Donald Trump&#x2019;s ties to Russia over the last four decades have been an open secret, hiding in plain sight. One reason they went largely unnoticed for so long may be that aspects of them are so unsettling, so transgressive, that Americans are loath to acknowledge the dark realities staring them in the face.<br><br> As a result, the exact words for what happened often give way to fierce semantic disputes.<br> Whatever Russia did with regard to the 2016 presidential campaign, was it an assault on America&#x2019;s sovereignty, or merely meddling? Was it an act of war? Did Russian interference change the results of the 2016 presidential election? Was it treason? Is Donald Trump a traitor? A Russian agent? Or merely a so-called useful idiot who somehow, through willful blindness or colossal ignorance, does not even know how he has been compromised by Russia?<br><br> President Donald Trump, of course, has denied having anything to do with Russia, having tweeted, ten days before his inauguration, &#x201c;Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!&#x201d;<br><br> But as this book will show, over the last four decades, President Donald Trump and his associates have had significant ties to at least fifty-nine people who facilitated business between Trump and the Russians, including relationships with dozens who have alleged ties to the Russian Mafia.<br><br> It will show that President Trump has allowed Trump-branded real estate to be used as a vehicle that likely served to launder enormous amounts of money&#x2014;perhaps billions of dollars&#x2014;for the Russian Mafia for more than three decades.<br><br> It will show that President Trump provided an operational home for oligarchs close to the Kremlin and some of the most powerful figures in the Russian Mafia in Trump Tower&#x2014;his personal and professional home, the crown jewel of his real estate empire&#x2014;and other Trump buildings on and off for much of that period.<br><br> It will show that during this period the Russian Mafia has likely been a de facto state actor serving the Russian Federation in much the same way that American intelligence services serve the United States, and that many of the people connected to Trump had strong ties to the Russian FSB, the state security service that is the successor to the feared KGB.<br><br> It will show that President Trump has been a person of interest to Soviet and Russian intelligence for more than forty years and was likely the subject of one or more operations that produced <i>kompromat </i>(compromising materials) on him regarding sexual activities.<br><br> It will show that for decades, Russian operatives, including key figures in the Russian Mafia, studiously examined the weak spots in America&#x2019;s pay-for-play political culture&#x2014;from gasoline distribution to Wall Street, from campaign finance to how the K Street lobbyists of Washington ply their trade&#x2014;and, having done so, hired powerful white-shoe lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, and real estate developers by the score, in an effort to compromise America&#x2019;s electoral system, legal process, and financial institutions.<br><br> It will show that President Trump, far from being the only potential &#x201c;asset&#x201d; targeted by the Russians, was one of dozens of politicians&#x2014;most of them Republicans, but some Democrats as well&#x2014;and businessmen who became indebted to Russia, and that millions of dollars have been flowing from individuals and companies from, or with ties to, Russia to GOP politicians, including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, for more than twenty years.<br><br> It will show that the most powerful figures in America&#x2019;s national security&#x2014;including two FBI directors, William Sessions and Louis Freeh, and special counsel to the CIA Mitchell Rogovin&#x2014;ended up working with Russians who had been deemed serious threats to the United States.<br> It will show that President Trump was $4 billion in debt when Russian money came to his rescue and bailed him out, and, as a result, he was and remains deeply indebted to them for reviving his business career and launching his new life in politics.<br><br> It will show that President Trump partnered with a convicted felon named Felix Sater who allegedly had ties to the Russian mob, and that Trump did not disclose the fact Sater was a criminal and profited from that relationship.<br><br> And it will show that, now that he is commander in chief of the United States, President Trump, as former director of national intelligence James Clapper put it, is, in effect, an intelligence &#x201c;asset&#x201d; serving Russian president Vladimir Putin, or, even worse, as Glenn Carle, a former CIA national intelligence officer, told <i>Newsweek</i>, &#x201c;My assessment is that Trump is actually working directly for the Russians.&#x201d;<br><br> Then again, maybe James Comey put it best. In January 2017, just a week after Donald Trump was inaugurated, the president invited then&#x2013; FBI director Comey to the White House for a private dinner. Characterizing Trump as &#x201c;unethical, and untethered to truth,&#x201d; likening his behavior to that of a Mafia boss, Comey writes in <i>A Higher Loyalty </i>that Trump told him: &#x201c;I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.&#x201d;<br><br> The demand reminded Comey of a Cosa Nostra induction ceremony, with Trump in the role of the Mafia family boss. &#x201c;The encounter left me shaken,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;I had never seen anything like it in the Oval Office. As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob. The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.&#x201d;<br><br> Comey writes as if the Mafia conceit is a metaphor. But in a way it is more than that. What follows is the story of Trump&#x2019;s four-decade-long relationship with the Russian Mafia, and the Russian intelligence operation that helped put him into the White House.<br><br> On June 23, 2017, six months after his inauguration, President Donald Trump tweeted that his predecessor Barack Obama &#x201c;knew far in advance&#x201d; about Russia&#x2019;s meddling in the American election. The tweet was unusual in that it represented a rare acknowledgment by the president that Russia may have interfered in the 2016 election, but it was accompanied by Trump&#x2019;s denunciation of any investigation into the matter as a &#x201c;witch hunt.&#x201d;<br><br> At the time, Russian president Vladimir Putin, who was en route to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia had annexed in 2014 from Ukraine, had reason to be grateful for any cover provided by his American friend. His stopover was not a popular one, rekindling as it did animosity in Ukraine, whose foreign ministry issued a statement saying that Kiev &#x201c;consider[ed] this visit . . . to be a gross violation of the sovereignty of the State and the territorial integrity of Ukraine.&#x201d; It was an issue that loomed large in the shadow play between the two men: Putin&#x2019;s apparent support of Trump seemingly went hand in hand with the latter&#x2019;s acquiescence on Russian aggression in Ukraine.<br><br> While Putin and Trump hogged the headlines, however, something took place in Devens, Massachusetts, that seemed light-years removed from the Trump-Russia scandal, but in fact was closely tied to its origins. John &#x201c;Sonny&#x201d; Franzese, the oldest federal prisoner in the United States, was discharged from the Federal Medical Center, after serving an eight-year sentence for extortion.<br><br> Thanks to his age&#x2014;Franzese had just celebrated his one hundredth birthday&#x2014;his release was duly noted all over the world, from <i>Der Spiegel</i> to the <i>New York Post, </i>which dutifully called forth Franzese&#x2019;s glory days hanging out with Frank Sinatra and boxing champ Jake LaMotta at the Copacabana. An underboss in the feared Colombo crime family, Franzese had repeatedly dodged murder charges because he was likely so good at making bodies disappear. But after one acquittal he was caught on tape explaining how he&#x2019;d disposed of the bodies of the dozens of people he had killed: &#x201c;Dismember victim in kiddie pool. Cook body parts in microwave. Stuff parts in garbage disposal. Be patient.&#x201d;<br><br> Franzese was old-school Mafia, a relic from the mid-twentieth-century era of the Cosa Nostra&#x2019;s Five Families, the same warring tribes depicted in <i>The Godfather, </i>and his return to Brooklyn evoked that powerful, mythic saga that has been so deeply imprinted in the American consciousness. Yet somehow the most enduring part of his legacy, one that will forever have its place in American history, is virtually unknown today. Through his son Michael, Sonny Franzese supervised a gasoline-tax-evasion scam that turned into a billion-dollar enterprise lasting for six years, until the FBI broke it up in the mid-eighties. The scandal also had far-reaching geopolitical consequences in that it gave the newly arrived Russian Mafia its first major score in America and positioned it to play a vital role in Donald Trump&#x2019;s rise to power, such a vital role that it is fair to say that without the Russian Mafia&#x2019;s move into New York, Donald Trump would not have become president of the United States.<br><br> Born in Naples in 1917, Sonny Franzese had immigrated to the United States with his family as a child, and in his youth rode shotgun on his father&#x2019;s bakery truck in Brooklyn. As recounted in Michael Franzese&#x2019;s <i>Blood Covenant, </i>he began his ascent back when Mafia nightlife meant dining at the Stork Club on West Fifty-Eighth Street in Manhattan, Sherman Billingsley&#x2019;s swanky refuge for caf� society, where Sonny courted and married the coat-check girl, and spent his evenings hanging out with the likes of Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Ernest Hemingway, Damon Runyon, and Walter Winchell. Before long, the Franzeses became an integral part of the storied Colombo crime family, the youngest and perhaps the most violent of the Five Families of organized crime, which were locked in an epic and ongoing internecine war.<br><br> When it came to bringing in revenue for the Colombo family, Sonny handled bookmaking, loan sharking, prostitution, shakedowns, and tax cheating. A thuggish, bull-necked man known for his boxer&#x2019;s flattened nose&#x2014;he was said to resemble boxer Rocky Graziano&#x2014;over time, he became a lean, meticulously groomed don sporting all the requisite sartorial flourishes of his profession&#x2014;crisp fedora, diamond pinkie ring, pointed black shoes, bespoke suits, and a beautifully tailored overcoat. Meanwhile, he commanded half a dozen lieutenants, each of whom had as many as thirty soldiers in their organizations, and carved out a reputation as a ferocious enforcer. &#x201c;He swam in the biggest ocean and was the biggest, meanest, most terrifying shark in that ocean,&#x201d; said Phil Steinberg, a close friend of Sonny&#x2019;s who was a major figure in the music industry. &#x201c;He was an enforcer, and he did what he did better than anyone.&#x201d; As his son Michael put it, Sonny &#x201c;could paralyze the most fearless hit man with a stare.&#x201d;<br><br> Sometimes he went significantly further than that. In 1974, a Colombo soldier who had been a bit too attentive to Sonny&#x2019;s wife was found buried in a cellar with a garrote around his neck. According to <i>Vanity Fair, </i>the man&#x2019;s genitals had been stuffed in his mouth, an act that authorities characterized as &#x201c;an apparent signal of Sonny&#x2019;s displeasure.&#x201d;<br><br> As underboss, Sonny was in line to run the entire Colombo organization, and, with Michael under his tutelage, the Franzeses sought opportunities in new sectors of the burgeoning entertainment industry that were opening up to the mob. They financed <i>Deep Throat, </i>Linda Lovelace&#x2019;s infamous porno film<i>. </i>They backed Phil Steinberg&#x2019;s Kama Sutra/Buddah Records, which provided opportunities for money laundering and payola&#x2014;not to mention hits by the Lovin&#x2019; Spoonful, the Shangri-Las, and Gladys Knight and the Pips, among others.<br><br> Before long, Michael had become a Colombo <i>caporegime </i>like his father, the youngest person on <i>Fortune </i>magazine&#x2019;s &#x201c;50 Biggest Mafia Bosses&#x201d; list, and one of the biggest earners in the Mafia since Al Capone. By the early eighties, however, organized crime in New York was undergoing a paradigmatic shift for a reason that was not yet widely known: The Russians were coming. In fact, Russians had begun collaborating with Italian mobsters as early as 1980, when the two crime organizations partnered in one of the most lucrative government rip-offs in American history.<br><br> At the time, Michael Franzese, then in his early thirties, was already providing protection to a mobster named Lawrence Iorizzo, who owned or supplied three hundred gas stations in and around Long Island and New Jersey, and was making a fortune by skimming tax revenue from gasoline sales. This scam was possible thanks to the sluggishness with which laggardly government officials collected gas taxes. Together, federal, state, and local authorities demanded on average twenty-seven cents out o...</p><h2>Complex Cloth: A Comprehensive Guide to Surface Design</h2><p><p>Discover textile artist Jane Dunnewold's secrets to creating visual complexity and depth in fabric.

Complex cloth is defined as white fabric which is altered by dyeing, painting, bleaching and foiling. The author is invironmentally aware, she recommends reusing containers and claims to use only safe products. There are constant reminders on safety and using materials with care. All the procedures can be done at home. She starts by testing the fabric's contents, even taking measures to test fabric samples before buying them, discreetly outside the shop. She explains how t make one's own stamps, stencils and screens for silk printing with clear instructions and photographs. She uses instant potato as a resist as well as more sophisticated techniques. Dyeing, painting and discharging with bleach are illustrated with examples of her work. This is a comprehensive well-written guide, a good introduction to creating unique fabric but it is unfortunate that only US suppliers are listed although email addresses are given. * Patchwork &amp; Quilting *</p><h2>Content of Our Character: A New Vision of Race in America</h2><p>Essays argue that Blacks are more oppressed by doubt than racism, look at the origins of racial conflict in America, and assess the failures of social policies designed to lessen racial differences</p><p>From the sight-lines of the university setting, Shelby Steele gives an account of race that is nothing if not controversial. Steele&#39;s nine essays derive their messages from personal experience dosed with broader social psychology. The value of this book, which won a 1990 National Book Critics Circle Award, lies in its introspection, rather than its distant calculation. Steele weeds the individual out of the group and argues for personal responsibility. He offers a unique look at the African-American experience and points a questioning finger at the children of affirmative action. The knee-jerk identification he observes &#34;presupposes a deep racist reflex in American life that will forever try to limit black possibility.&#34;<p>Shelby Steele is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and Stanford University, and is a contributing editor at <em>Harper</em>'s magazine.

Not so with this unusual little novel, which <i>The New York Times</i> called a "note-perfect, horror-comic ventriloquization of a half-bright, infantile serial killer." Joyce Carol Oates has so convincingly written through the voice of a killer, you will feel nervous while reading at how familiar, how <i>human</i>, he is. Part of how she achieves the effect is through sparing use of bizarre capitalization (e.g., "MOON" and "FRAGMENT") and crude drawings done with a felt-tip pen. But the language is what makes it come alive, as in such weird statements as "My whole body is a numb tongue."

Silko weaves tales from her family's past into her observations, using the turquoise stones she finds on the walks to unite the strands of her stories, while the beauty and symbolism of the landscape around her, and of the snakes, birds, dogs, and other animals that share her life and form part of her family, figure prominently in her memories. Strongly influenced by Native American storytelling traditions, <i>The Turquoise Ledge</i> becomes a moving and deeply personal contemplation of the enormous spiritual power of the natural world-of what these creatures and landscapes can communicate to us, and how they are all linked. <br><br> The book is Silko's first extended work of nonfiction, and its ambitious scope, clear prose, and inventive structure are captivating. <i>The Turquoise Ledge</i> will delight loyal fans and new readers alike, and it marks the return of the unique voice and vision of a gifted storyteller.</p><p>Leslie Marmon Silko was born in 1948 to a family whose ancestry includes Mexican, Laguna Indian, and European forebears. She has said that her writing has at its core &#x201c;the attempt to identify what it is to be a half-breed or mixed-blood person.&#x201d; As she grew up on the Laguna Pueblo Reservation, she learned the stories and culture of the Laguna people from her great-grandmother and other female relatives. After receiving her B. A. in English at the University of New Mexico, she enrolled in the University of New Mexico law school but completed only three semesters before deciding that writing and storytelling, not law, were the means by which she could best promote justice. She married John Silko in 1970. Prior to the writing of <i>Ceremony</i>, she published a series of short stories, including &#x201c;The Man to Send Rain Clouds.&#x201d; She also authored a volume of poetry, <i>Laguna Woman: Poems</i>, for which she received the Pushcart Prize for Poetry. <p>In 1973, Silko moved to Ketchikan, Alaska, where she wrote <i>Ceremony</i>. Initially conceived as a comic story abut a mother&#x2019;s attempts to keep her son, a war veteran, away from alcohol, <i>Ceremony</i> gradually transformed into an intricate meditation on mental disturbance, despair, and the power of stories and traditional culture as the keys to self-awareness and, eventually, emotional healing. Having battled depression herself while composing her novel, Silko was later to call her book &#x201c;a ceremony for staying sane.&#x201d; Silko has followed the critical success of <i>Ceremony</i> with a series of other novels, including <i>Storyteller, Almanac for the Dead</i>, and <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i>. Nevertheless, it was the singular achievement of <i>Ceremony</i> that first secured her a place among the first rank of Native American novelists. Leslie Marmon Silko now lives on a ranch near Tucson, Arizona. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p>*Starred Review* The turquoise stones Silko finds in the Tucson Mountains near her home embody the story of the land and her own complex heritage. A MacArthur fellow, Silko drew on her Laguna Pueblo, Cherokee, Mexican, and European ancestry in her previous books, including her seminal novels Ceremony (1978) and Gardens in the Dunes (1999). She digs even deeper in this richly veined, dramatic, and mysterious self-portrait, telling gripping stories of suffering and wisdom from each branch of her complex family tree that reveal the consequences of racism, the war against Native Americans, and the abuse of nature, including shocking glimpses into the Indian slave trade and the dire effects of the atomic bomb tests and uranium mining. Vivid portraits of her grandmothers and mother are matched by amazing tales of the animal members of Silko&#x2019;s extended family, from horses and dogs to macaws and rattlesnakes. Mesmerizing descriptions of desert and drought, musings over the significance of turquoise, concern over environmental destruction, harrowing personal struggles, and haunting revelations of spiritual forces converge in a provocative and numinous memoir that backs Silko&#x2019;s resounding perception that &#x201c;in the Americas, the sacred surrounds us, no matter how damaged or changed a place may appear to be.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>A Stranger in the House: A Novel</h2><p><b><b><b><b>Shari Lapena&#x2019;s new thriller,&nbsp;<b>AN UNWANTED GUEST,</b>&nbsp;is available now!</b></b></b><br><br>&#x201c;Smart and suspenseful. . . you'll never see the ending coming.&#x201d; --<b>PureWow</b><br><br>In this neighborhood, danger lies close to home.

Her books have been sold in 35 territories around the world.&nbsp; She lives in Toronto.Chapter One<br><br> On this hot August night, Tom Krupp parks his car&#x2013;a leased Lexus&#x2013;in the driveway of his handsome two-story home. The house, complete with a two-car garage, is set behind a generous lawn and framed with beautiful old trees. To the right of the driveway, a flagstone path crosses in front of the porch, with steps leading up to a solid wooden door in the middle of the house. To the right of the front door is a large picture window the width of the living room.<br><br> The house sits on a gently curving street that ends in a cul-de-sac. The surrounding houses are all equally attractive and well maintained, and relatively similar. People who live here are successful and settled; everyone's a little bit smug.<br><br> This quiet, prosperous suburb in upstate New York, populated with mostly professional couples and their families, seems oblivious to the problems of the small city that surrounds it, oblivious to the problems of the larger world, as if the American dream has continued to live on here, smooth and unruffled.<br><br> But the untroubled setting does not match Tom's current state of mind. He cuts the lights and the engine and sits uneasily for a moment in the dark, despising himself.<br><br> Then, with a start, he notices that his wife's car is not in its usual place in the driveway. He automatically checks his watch: 9:20. He wonders if he's forgotten something. Was she going out? He can't remember her mentioning anything, but he's been so busy lately. Maybe she just went out to run an errand and will be back any minute. She's left the lights on; they give the house a welcoming glow.<br><br> He gets out of the car into the summer night&#x2013;it smells of freshly mown grass&#x2013;swallowing his disappointment. He wanted, rather fervently, to see his wife. He stands for a moment, his hand on the roof of the car, and looks across the street. Then he grabs his briefcase and suit jacket from the passenger seat and tiredly closes the car door. He walks along the path, up the front steps, and opens the door. Something is wrong. He holds his breath.<br><br> Tom stands completely still in the doorway, his hand resting on the knob. At first he doesn't know what's bothering him. Then he realizes what it is. The door wasn't locked. That in itself isn't unusual-most nights he comes home and opens the door and walks right in, because most nights Karen's home, waiting for him. But she's gone out with her car and forgotten to lock the door. That's very odd for his wife, who's a stickler about locking the doors. He slowly lets out his breath. Maybe she was in a rush and forgot.<br><br> His eyes quickly take in the living room, a serene rectangle of pale gray and white. It's perfectly quiet; there's obviously no one home. She left the lights on, so she must not have gone out for long. Maybe she went to get some milk. There will probably be a note for him. He tosses his keys onto the small table by the front door and heads straight for the kitchen at the back of the house. He's starving. He wonders if she's already eaten or whether she's been waiting for him.<br><br> It's obvious that she's been preparing their supper. A salad is almost finished; she has stopped slicing mid-tomato. He looks at the wooden cutting board, at the tomato and the sharp knife lying beside it. There's pasta on the granite counter, ready to be cooked, a large pot of water on the stainless steel gas stove. The stove is off and the water in the pot is cold; he dips a finger in to check. He scans the refrigerator door for a note-there's nothing written on the whiteboard for him. He frowns. He pulls his cell phone out of his pants pocket and checks to see if there's any message from her that he might have missed. Nothing. Now he's mildly annoyed. She might have told him.<br><br> Tom opens the door to the refrigerator and stands there for a minute, staring sightlessly at its contents, then grabs an imported beer and decides to start the pasta. He's sure she'll be home any minute. He looks around curiously to see what they might have run out of. They have milk, bread, pasta sauce, wine, parmesan cheese. He checks the bathroom-there's plenty of toilet paper. He can't think of anything else that might be urgent. While he waits for the water to come to a boil, he calls her cell, but she doesn't pick up.<br><br> Fifteen minutes later, the pasta is ready, but there is no sign of his wife. Tom leaves the pasta in the strainer in the sink, turns off the burner under the pot of tomato sauce, and wanders restlessly into the living room, his hunger forgotten. He looks out the large picture window across the lawn to the street beyond. Where the hell is she? He's starting to get anxious now. He calls her cell again and hears a faint vibration coming from behind him. He whips his head toward the sound and sees her cell phone, vibrating against the back of the sofa. Shit. She forgot her phone. How can he reach her now?<br><br> He starts looking around the house for clues as to where she might have gone. Upstairs, in their bedroom, he's surprised to find her bag sitting on her bedside table. He opens it with clumsy fingers, faintly guilty about going through his wife's purse. It feels private. But this is an emergency. He dumps the contents onto the middle of their neatly made bed. Her wallet is there, her change purse, lipstick, pen, a tissue packet-it's all there. Not an errand then. Maybe she stepped out to help a friend? An emergency of some kind? Still, she would have taken her purse with her if she was driving the car. And wouldn't she have called him by now if she could? She could borrow someone else's phone. It's not like her to be thoughtless.<br><br> Tom sits on the edge of the bed, quietly unraveling. His heart is beating too fast. Something is wrong. He thinks that maybe he should call the police. He considers how that might go. My wife went out and I don't know where she is. She left without her phone and her purse. She forgot to lock the door. It's completely unlike her. They probably won't take him seriously if she's been gone such a short time. He hasn't seen any sign of a struggle. Nothing is out of place.<br><br> Suddenly he gets up off the bed and rapidly searches the entire house. But he finds nothing alarming&#x2013;no phone knocked off the hook, no broken window, no smear of blood on the floor. Even so, he's breathing as anxiously as if he had.<br><br> He hesitates. Perhaps the police will think they've had an argument. It won't matter if he tells them there was no argument, if he tells them they almost never argue. That theirs is an almost perfect marriage.<br><br> Instead of calling the police, he runs back into the kitchen, where Karen keeps a list of phone numbers, and starts calling her friends.<br><br>-<br><br> Looking at the wreckage in front of him, Officer Kirton shakes his head in resignation. People and cars. He's seen things to make his stomach empty itself on the spot. It wasn't that bad this time.<br><br> There'd been no identification on the crash victim, a woman, probably early thirties. No purse, no wallet. But the vehicle registration and insurance had been in the glove compartment. The car is registered to a Karen Krupp, at 24 Dogwood Drive. She'll have some explaining to do. And some charges to face.

Three mismatched bad guys--a Palm Beach potted, a Bahamian ex-con, and a Puerto Rican gardener turned mob enforcer--get together to carry out the perfect crime: kidnap retired Miami bookie Harry Arno and let him pay the ransom with his ill-gotten wealth. He can't go to the cops later. No one will miss him. It's perfect. Or so they figure.<br>They figure wrong. Harry's former girlfriend, ex-topless dancer Joyce Patton, misses him a lot. Now she's sending her current boyfriend, Stetson-hatted federal marshal Raylan Givens, looking for Harry. And Raylan always gets his man. And in this case, he also gets his woman--the last person to see Harry, a sexy psychic named Dawn. Dawn may be clairvoyant, or she may be in on the kidnapping. Either way, she gives Raylan a lead, and he's hunting on Florida's 24-karat Gold Coast for three loco hombres...and trying to bring Harry back alive...<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>In this sequel to <i>Pronto</i>, Harry Arno has retired from bookmaking but is still closing out some of his outstanding debts. But then his collection agent, an ex-con by the name of Bobby Deo, goes to pick up $1,800 from Chip Ganz and ends up getting hired for a hostage-taking operation (like kidnapping "in a way," Chip tells him, "only different. A lot different.") When Harry's taken by his own man, it's up to United States Marshal Raylan Givens to track him down, in the same methodically relentless fashion he tracked Harry that time he ran off to Italy. Throw in a henchman named Louis Lewis with plans of his own and an attractive young psychic named Reverend Dawn, and you've got yet another crime story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat--occasionally chuckling to yourself--straight through to the finish. (And bonus points to loyal Leonard fans who can spot the crossover elements from <i>Rum Punch</i> and <i>Maximum Bob</i>.) <i>--Ron Hogan</i>"Many imitate him but none can touch him. He's set the standard against which all other crime novels are measured. His signature is vise-tightening suspense, crackling dialogue, and deadeye wit. And now, in his new novel, <i>Riding The Rap</i>, Elmore Leonard proves once again that he is "the greatest living writer of crime fiction." <i>(The New York Times</i> )<p> Raylan Givens, U.S. Marshal, is working on Warrants, bringing in fugitive felons, when Harry Arno disappears again and Raylan feels obliged to find him. This time with misgivings. Raylan believes Harry has dropped out of site to get attention and win back his former lover, Joyce, who had fallen into Raylan's arms, but now seems concerned only with Harry's welfare.</p><p> The last person to see Harry is a nifty young psychic -- certified medium and spiritualist -- named Dawn Navarro. As soon as Raylan talks to her he senses that Harry has very likely been kidnapped and Dawn is involved.</p><p> Cut to the bad guys. Chip Ganz describes his idea, a way to make millions, as "taking hostages." Not unlike the way it was done in Lebanon, but this time for profit. Does he mean kidnapping? "In a way," Chip tells his ex-con accomplice, Louis Lewis and Bobby Deo, "only different. A lot different." It's the victim who has to come up with a way to pay the ransom. "It had better be the best idea you've ever had," Chip tells Harry, blindfolded and in chains. "Because if we don't like it, you're dead."</p><p> In time Raylan's pretty sure he knows where Harry is being held, but doesn't have "probable cause" to get a warrant and gain entry. As he closes in, though, Chip's hostage plan begins to come apart and the scene is set for a showdown -- one of the best you'll ever see.</p><p> "<i>Riding The Rap</i> made me feel like a kid again.

A.R. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia</h2><p>Shrouding themselves and their aims in deepest secrecy, the leaders of the Taliban movement control Afghanistan with an inflexible, crushing fundamentalism. The most extreme and radical of all Islamic organizations, the Taliban inspires fascination, controversy, and especially fear in both the Muslim world and the West. Correspondent Ahmed Rashid brings the shadowy world of the Taliban into sharp focus in this enormously interesting and revealing book. It is the only authoritative account of the Taliban and modern day Afghanistan available to English language readers.<br><br>Based on his experiences as a journalist covering the civil war in Afghanistan for twenty years, traveling and living with the Taliban, and interviewing most of the Taliban leaders since their emergence to power in 1994, Rashid offers unparalleled firsthand information. He explains how the growth of Taliban power has already created severe instability in Russia, Iran, Pakistan, and five Central Asian republics. He describes the Taliban&#x2019;s role as a major player in a new &#x201c;Great Game&#x201d;&#x2014;a competition among Western countries and companies to build oil and gas pipelines from Central Asia to Western and Asian markets. The author also discusses the controversial changes in American attitudes toward the Taliban&#x2014;from early support to recent bombings of Osama Bin Laden&#x2019;s hideaway and other Taliban-protected terrorist bases&#x2014;and how they have influenced the stability of the region.<br></p><p>This is the single best book available on the Taliban, the fundamentalist Islamic regime in Afghanistan responsible for harboring the terrorist Osama bin Laden. Ahmed Rashid is a Pakistani journalist who has spent most of his career reporting on the region--he has personally met and interviewed many of the Taliban's shadowy leaders. <i>Taliban</i> was written and published before the massacres of September 11, 2001, yet it is essential reading for anyone who hopes to understand the aftermath of that black day. It includes details on how and why the Taliban came to power, the government's oppression of ordinary citizens (especially women), the heroin trade, oil intrigue, and--in a vitally relevant chapter--bin Laden's sinister rise to power. These pages contain stories of mass slaughter, beheadings, and the Taliban's crushing war against freedom: under Mullah Omar, it has banned everything from kite flying to singing and dancing at weddings. Rashid is for the most part an objective reporter, though his rage sometimes (and understandably) comes to the surface: "The Taliban were right, their interpretation of Islam was right, and everything else was wrong and an expression of human weakness and a lack of piety," he notes with sarcasm. He has produced a compelling portrait of modern evil. <i>--John Miller</i>Ahmed Rashid is a correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review and the Daily Telegraph, reporting on Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia.</p><h2>Algebra: Structure and Method, Book 1, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Hardcover Teacher&#39;s Edition ISBN-10: 0395977231</p><p></p><h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2><p>HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE</p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

He lives in New York City.1WASHINGTON, D.C.1At three o&#39;clock in the afternoon of a grey, blowing mid-November day, a baby doctor named Michael Poole looked down through the windows of his second-floor room into the parking lot of the Sheraton Hotel. A VW van, spray-painted with fuzzy peace symbols and driven by either a drunk or a lunatic, was going for a ninety-eight-point turn in the space between the first parking row and the entrance, trapping a honking line of cars in the single entry lane. As Michael watched, the van completed its turn by grinding its front bumper into the grille and headlights of a dusty little Camaro. The whole front end of the Camaro buckled in. Horns blew. The van now faced a stalled, frustrated line of enemy vehicles. The driver backed up, and Michael thought he was going to escape by reversing down the first row of cars to the exit onto Woodley Road. Instead, the driver nipped the van into an empty space two cars down. &#34;Well, damn,&#34; Michael said to himself--the van&#39;s driver had sacrificed the Camaro for a parking place.Michael had called down twice for messages, but none of the other three men had checked in yet. Unless Conor Linklater was going to ride a motorcycle all the way from Norwalk, they would almost certainly take the shuttle from New York, but Michael enjoyed the fantasy that while he stood at the window he would see them all step out of the van--Harry &#34;Beans&#34; Beevers, the Lost Boss, the world&#39;s worst lieutenant; Tina Pumo, Pumo the Puma, whom Underhill had called &#34;Lady&#34; Pumo; and wild little Conor Linklater, the only other survivors of their platoon. Of course they would arrive separately, in taxis, at the front of the hotel. But he wished they would get out of the van. He hadn&#39;t known how strongly he wanted them to join him--he wanted to see the Memorial first by himself, but he wanted even more to see it later with them.Michael Poole watched the doors of the van slide open. There appeared first a hand clamped around the neck of a bottle which Michael immediately recognized as Jack Daniel&#39;s sour mash whiskey.The Jack Daniel&#39;s was slowly followed by a thick arm, then a head concealed by a floppy jungle hat. The whole man, now slamming the driver&#39;s door, was well over six feet tall and weighed at least two hundred and thirty pounds. He wore tiger-stripe fatigues. Two smaller men similarly dressed left through the sliding door in the side of the van, and a big bearded man in a worn flak jacket closed the van&#39;s passenger door and went around the front to take the bottle. He laughed, shook his head, and upended it into his mouth before passing it to one of the others. Individually and collectively they looked just enough like dozens of soldiers Poole had known for him to lean forward, staring, his forehead pressed against the glass.Of course he knew none of these men. The resemblance was generic. The big man was not Underhill, and the others were none of the others.He wanted to see people he had known over there, that was the large simple truth. He wanted a great grand reunion with everyone he had ever seen in Vietnam, living or dead. And he wanted to see the Memorial--in fact Poole wanted to love the Memorial. He was almost afraid to see it. From the pictures he had seen, the Memorial was beautiful, strong and stark, and brooding. That would be a Memorial worth loving. The only memorial he&#39;d ever expected to have was a memorial to separateness, but it belonged to him and to the cowboys out in the parking lot, because they were forever distinct, as the dead were finally distinct. Together they were all so distinct that to Poole they almost felt like a secret country of their own.There were names he wanted to find on the Memorial, names that stood in place of his own.The big cowboy had taken a slip of paper from his shirt pocket and was writing, bent halfway over the hood of the van. The others unloaded duffel bags from the back of the van. The Jack Daniel&#39;s bottle circulated until the driver took a last slug and eased it into one of the bags.Now Michael wanted to be outside, to be moving. According to the schedule he had picked up at the registration desk downstairs, the parade up Constitution Avenue had already begun. By the time he had his first look at the Memorial and came back, the others would have checked in.Unless, that is, Harry Beevers had managed to get drunk at the bar of Tina Pumo&#39;s restaurant and was still asking for one more vodka martini, one more little teeny martooni, we&#39;ll catch the five o&#39;clock shuttle instead of the four o&#39;clock, or the six o&#39;clock, or the seven. Tina Pumo, the only one of the old group Poole saw with anything like regularity, had told him that Beevers sometimes spent all afternoon in his place. Poole&#39;s only contact with Harry Beevers in four or five years had come three months before, when Beevers had called him up to read aloud a Stars and Stripes article, sent to Beevers by his brother, about a series of random murders committed in the Far East by someone who identified himself as Koko.Poole stepped back from the window. It was not time for Koko, now. The giant in tiger stripes and jungle hat finished putting his note under one of the Camaro&#39;s windshield wipers. What could it say? Sorry I beat up your car, man, come around for a shot of Jack--Poole sat down on the edge of the bed, picked up the receiver, and after a second of hesitation dialed Judy&#39;s number at school. When she answered he said, &#34;Well, I&#39;m here, but the other guys haven&#39;t checked in yet.&#34;&#34;Do you want me to say, &#39;Poor Michael&#39;?&#34; asked Judy.&#34;No, I thought you&#39;d like to know what&#39;s going on.&#34;&#34;Look, Michael, is something special on your mind? This conversation has no point. You&#39;re going to spend a couple of days going all drunk and sentimental with your old army buddies. Do I have any place in that? I&#39;d just make you feel guilty.&#34;&#34;I still wish you&#39;d have come along.&#34;&#34;I think the past is in the past because that&#39;s where it belongs. Does that tell you anything?&#34;&#34;I guess it does,&#34; Michael said. There was a moment of silence that went on too long. She would not speak until he did. &#34;Okay,&#34; Michael finally said. &#34;I&#39;ll probably see Beevers and Tina Pumo and Conor tonight, and there are some ceremonies I&#39;d like to take part in tomorrow. I&#39;ll get home Sunday about five or six, I suppose.&#34;&#34;Your patients are extremely understanding.&#34;&#34;Diaper rash is rarely fatal,&#34; Michael said, and Judy uttered a smoky exhalation that might have been laughter.&#34;Should I call you tomorrow?&#34;&#34;Don&#39;t bother. It&#39;s nice, but don&#39;t bother, really.&#34;&#34;Really,&#34; Michael said, and hung up.2Michael moved slowly through the Sheraton&#39;s lobby looking at the men lined up at the registration desk, among them the big cowboy in tiger-stripe fatigues and his three buddies, and the groups of people sitting on padded dark green chairs and banquettes. The Sheraton was one of those hotels with no true bar. Women in clinging, filmy dresses brought drinks to the twenty or thirty tables in the sunken lobby. The waitresses all seemed to have descended from the same tall, languid, handsome family. Where these princesses might normally have served gin-and-tonics and Perriers-and-lime to men with dark suits and power haircuts--to men like Michael Poole&#39;s neighbors in Westchester County--now they set down shots of tequila and bottles of beer before wildmen in battle jackets and bush hats, in funky fatigues and funkier khaki ballcaps.The sulphurous conversation with his wife made Michael want to sit down among the wildmen and order a drink. But if he sat down, he would be drawn into things. Someone would begin to talk to him. He would buy a drink for a man who had been in some of the same places he had been, or had been near the places he had been, or who had a friend who had been near those places. Then the man would buy him a drink. This would lead to stories, memories, theories, introductions, vows of brotherhood. Eventually he would join the parade as part of a gang of strangers and see the Memorial through the thick insulating comfort of alcohol. Michael kept moving.&#34;Cavalry all the way!&#34; shouted a whiskey voice behind his back.Michael went through a side door out into the parking lot. It was just a little too cold for his tweed jacket and sweater, but he decided not to go back upstairs for his coat. The heavy billowing sky threatened rain, but Michael decided that he didn&#39;t much care if it rained.Cars streamed up the ramp from the street. Florida license plates, Texas plates, Iowa and Kansas and Alabama, every kind and make of vehicle, from hardcore GM pickups to tinny Japanese imports. The van cowboy and his friends had driven to Washington from New Jersey, the Garden State. Tucked beneath the Camaro&#39;s windshield wiper was the note: You were in my way so FUCK YA!!!Down on the street, Michael flagged a cab and asked the driver to take him to Constitution Avenue.&#34;You gonna walk in the parade?&#34; the driver immediately asked.&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;&#34;You re a vet, you were over there?&#34;&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; Michael looked up. From the back, the cabdriver could have been one of the earnest, desperate, slightly crazed students doomed to flunk out of medical school: colorless plastic glasses, dishwater hair, pale youthful skin. His ID plate said that his name was Thomas Strack. Blood from an enormous pimple had dried on the collar of his shirt.&#34;You ever in combat? Like in a firefight or something?&#34;&#34;Now and then.&#34;&#34;There&#39;s somethin&#39; I always wanted to ask--I hope you don&#39;t take no offense or nothing.&#34;Michael knew what the cabdriver was going to ask. &#34;If you don&#39;t want me to take offense, don&#39;t ask an offensive question.&#34;&#34;Okay.&#34; The driver turned his head to glance at Michael, then looked straight ahead again. &#34;Okay, no need to get heavy.&#34;&#34;I can&#39;t tell you how it feels to kill someone,&#34; Michael said.&#34;You mean you never did it.&#34;&#34;No, I mean I can&#39;t tell you.&#34;The cabbie drove the rest of the way in boiling silence. You coulda told me something. Gimme a little gore, why don&#39;t you? Lemme see that good old guilt, lemme see that fine old rapture. The past is in the past because that&#39;s where it belongs. Don&#39;t bother, really. You were in my way, so fuck ya.I&#39;ll take a triple Finlandia martini on the rocks, please, hold the olives, hold the vermouth, please, hold the rocks, please, and get the same thing for my four hundred buddies in here, please. They might look a little funny, but they&#39;re my tribe.&#34;This okay?&#34; the cabbie asked. Beside the car was a wall of people. Michael could see flags and men carrying banners suspended between poles. He paid the driver and left the cab.Michael could see over the heads of most of the people lining the sidewalk. Here the tribe had gathered, all right. Men who had once been soldiers, most of them dressed as though they were still soldiers, filled the width of Constitution Avenue. In platoon-sized groups interspersed with high school bands, they marched raggedly down the street. Other people stood on the sidewalk and watched them go by because they approved of what they were, what they meant because of what they had done. By standing there the bystanders applauded. Until now, Michael realized, he had resisted fully believing in the reality of this parade.It was not ticker tape and limousines on Fifth Avenue--the Iranian hostages had been given that one--but in most ways this was better, being more inclusive, less euphoric but more emotional. Michael edged through the people on the sidewalk. He stepped off the curb and fell in behind the nearest large and irregular group. Surprised tears instantly filled his eyes.The men before him were three-fourths jungle fighters with everything but Claymores and M-16s, and one-fourth pudgy WWII vets who looked like ex-boxers. Michael realized that the sun had come out only when he saw their long shadows stretching out to him on the street.He could see Tim Underhill, another long shadow, striding along with his belly before him and cigar smoke drifting in his wake. In his mind, Underhill was muttering obscene hilarious remarks about everyone in sight and wearing his summer uniform of a bandanna and blousy fatigue pants. A streak of mosquito blood was smeared across his left shoulder.In spite of everything, Michael wished that Underhill were beside him now. Michael realized that he had been considering Underhill--not brooding or thinking about him, considering him--since Harry Beevers had called him up at the end of October to tell him about the newspaper articles his brother had sent him from Okinawa.In two separate incidents, three people, an English tourist in his early forties and an older American couple, had been murdered in Singapore just about the time the Iranian hostages had returned to America. The murders were thought to have been committed at least a week to ten days apart. The Englishman&#39;s body was found on the grounds of the Goodwood Park hotel, those of the American couple in a vacant bungalow in the Orchard Road section of the city. All three bodies had been mutilated, and on two of them had been found playing cards scrawled with an unusual and enigmatic name: Koko. Six months later, in the summer of 1981, two French journalists were found similarly mutilated in their Bangkok hotel room. Playing cards with the same name had been placed on the bodies. The only difference between these killings and those that had happened after Ia Thuc, a decade and a half earlier, was that the cards were not regimental, but ordinary commercial playing cards.Michael thought Underhill lived in Singapore. At least Underhill had always claimed that he was going to move there after he got out of the army. But Poole could not make the mental leap required to convict Tim Underhill of murder.Poole had known two extraordinary human beings during his time in Vietnam, two men who had stood out as exceptionally worthy of respect and affection in the half-circus, half-laboratory of human behavior that a longstanding combat unit becomes. Tim Underhill was one, and a boy from Milwaukee named M.O. Dengler was the other. The bravest people he had ever known, Underhill and little Dengler had seemed perfectly at home in Vietnam.</p><h2>Some More Horse Tradin&#39;</h2><p>The author recalls his life in the West and the joys and problems of horse trading</p><p>From the same corral that produced the widely loved Horse Tradin', Ben K.

Long after their initial publication, Speer's memoir continues to provide one of the most detailed and fascinating portrayals of life within Hitler's inner circles, the rise and fall of the third German empire, and of Hitler himself.<p> Speer chronicles his entire life, but the majority of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> focuses on the years between 1933 and 1945, when Speer figured prominently in Hitler's government and the German war effort as Inspector General of Buildings for the Renovation of the Federal Capital and later as Minister of Arms and Munitions. Speer's recollections of both duties foreground the impossibility of reconciling Hitler's idealistic, imperialistic ambitions with both architectural and military reality. Throughout, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> remains true to its author's intentions. With compelling insight, Speer reveals many of the "premises which almost inevitably led to the disasters" of the Third Reich as well as "what comes from one man's holding unrestricted power in his hands." <i>-- Bertina Loeffler</i></p>Albert Speer was Hitler&#39;s right hand man.

Their scheme is jeopardized when the Gestapo meets the train with dogs that sniff out both smugglers and contraband food. To foil the Nazis, the sisters gather up the feral cats of Krasinski Square in baskets. They release the cats as a distraction to the dogs, thus allowing the food to be smuggled into the ghetto. Skilled pacing renders the cat solution a satisfyingly subversive surprise while Watson's illustration of the flummoxed Nazis underscores the ensuing chaos. The illustrations, with their soft but firm line and monochromatic sepia-toned palette, have an appropriate retro look. Among the great historical avalanche of Holocaust stories, Hesse has found a little-known vignette that she treats with her customary modest but elevating free-verse style, making a grave subject enormously accessible, gently humorous, and affectingly triumphant. (author's note, historical note) (Picture book. 6-10)<br>School Library Journal<br>November 1, 2004<br>Gr 3-5-Set in Warsaw in 1942, this picture book brings to life a little-known incident of Jewish resistance. A young girl who has escaped the Ghetto lives with her older sister who, with friends, plans to smuggle food to those still there. Somehow the Gestapo has heard of the plan and has designs of its own-dogs to sniff out the bundles of food arriving with the resisters on a train. With quick thinking, the friends gather all of the cats living in Krasinski Square into baskets and head for the station. Just as the train pulls in, the felines are let loose, the dogs chase the cats, chaos erupts, and eventually the contraband is passed through the chinks in the Ghetto wall. Illustrated by Watson in an arresting departure from her usual style in muted tans, browns, and oranges, the cats, the people, the buildings of Warsaw, and even the snarling dogs are bathed in a warm yellow light-a kind of innocent luminescence of hope that belies the evil that is being done. The play of light and the naturalness of the cats' poses are almost a comfort in a story that adults sense as keenly distressing, and that beckons for adult interpretation or guidance. What is clear is the immediate poignancy of these cats and the author's evocative language in describing them: "They belonged once to someone. They slept on sofa cushions- they purred- nuzzling the chins of their beloveds." They could be the Polish Jewry of the Warsaw Ghetto.-Harriett Fargnoli, Great Neck Library, NY Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information. <br><br>Booklist<br>STARRED October 15, 2004<br>Gr. 2-5. In luminous free verse, Hesse's latest picture book tells a powerful story of a young Jewish girl who, together with her older sister, ingeniously fights the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. After escaping from the Jewish ghetto, the girl avoids detection: I wear my Polish look, / I walk my Polish walk. / Polish words float from my lips / and I am almost safe, / almost invisible. She finds joy in playing with the city's abandoned cats, who show her holes in the ghetto wall, which the girl's older sister and their resistance friends will use to pass supplies shipped by train to Warsaw. The Gestapo learns of the scheme, and soldiers wait at the train station with dogs. Luckily, the cats inspire a solution; they distract the dogs and protect the supplies. It's an empowering story about the bravery and impact of young people, and Hesse's clear, spare poetry, from the girl's viewpoint, refers to the hardships suffered without didacticism. In bold, black lines and washes of smoky gray and ochre, Watson's arresting images echo the pared-down language as well as the hope that shines like the glints of sunlight on Krasinski Square. An author's note references the true events and heartbreaking history that inspired this stirring, expertly crafted story. --Gillian Engberg Copyright 2004 Booklist <br><br>Horn Book Magazine<br>September 1, 2004<br><br>(Intermediate) A little girl (perhaps ten years old or so) narrates this story of wartime Poland, describing her visits with the abandoned cats in Krasinski Square and how they came to be helpers in a scheme to smuggle food into the Warsaw Ghetto. The girl has escaped from the Ghetto and now protects herself by looking like "any child": "I wear my Polish look, / I walk my Polish walk. / Polish words float from my lips / and I am almost safe, / almost invisible." The girl and her older sister work with the Jewish resistance to get food into the Ghetto, but when word comes that their plan is known by the Gestapo, the cats provide a useful distraction. Both author and artist achieve a fine balance of beauty and sadness. Simple, graceful words and pictures make this adventure story a taut and moving one. Watson's illustrations -- watercolor, ink, and pencil -- reveal the girl's sensitivity and delicacy, while the artist's depiction of the cats seems to pay homage to Wanda Gag's Millions of Cats. Watson shows the wartime city -- with the soldiers and their dogs patrolling streets lined with elegant buildings -- using warm shades of browns and golds to convey a soft glow of hope alongside tragedy. Some may object to the imaginary story of quiet triumph set against real-life tragic events, but Hesse's author's note explains where her idea came from, and how, just as in this tale, Jews passing as non-Jewish Poles played a critical role in saving others.

All rights reserved. <br><br>Publishers Weekly<br>August 23, 2004<br>STARRED<br>In her spare yet lyrical narrative, Newbery medalist Hesse (Out of the Dust) relays a haunting story based on an actual incident involving Poland's Warsaw Ghetto. Watson, best known for Father Fox's Pennyrhymes, makes a stunning stylistic departure here, with artwork in muted tones of brown, gold and brick red. An aerial view of Krasinski Square on the title spread depicts buildings with gaping holes that define a plaza overrun with tanks and soldiers. Into this atmosphere, author and illustrator introduce the young narrator, who approaches a line of stray cats emerging from a pile of rubble. "I look like any child/ playing with cats/ in the daylight/ in Warsaw,/ my Jewish armband/ burned with the rags I wore/ when I escaped the Ghetto." The girl comforts the many homeless cats who "belonged once to someone /[and] slept on sofa cushions/ and ate from crystal dishes," whispering to them that she has "no food to spare." Yet she has more to eat than her friend Michal, who lives on the other side of the Wall. The child's older sister, Mira ("all that is left of our family"), describes the "newest plan" to smuggle food into the Ghetto: friends will come by train, hiding food in their satchels, which the sisters and others will sneak through the cracks in the Wall. When word comes that the Gestapo has caught wind of the plan and will meet the train with dogs to sniff out the smugglers, the narrator comes up with a plan of her own to foil the Nazis. Watson achieves an impressive versatility with her pencil, ink and watercolor artwork; her fine ink line emphasizes the starkness of the Ghetto's confines while her warmly toned watercolor wash conveys the coziness of Mira's home, spare though it may be. Other touches�the almost comical chaos that erupts at the train station in a flurry of cats and dogs, and the town carousel, a universal mark of childhood�allow readers to experience the terrifying events from somewhat of a cushioned distance. Author and artist take a complex situation and make its most important aspects comprehensible to a child. Older readers will most appreciate the bravery and intelligence of this impressive heroine.

During these years, the United States began to be a nation for all its people, outlawing school segregation, protesting war in Vietnam, and campaigning for equal rights for women. From Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall to seamstress Rosa Parks, extraordinary individuals led us back to the ideals espoused by the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. But mostly-as it always has been in the United States-it was ordinary citizens who marched and voted and hoped and dreamed and made things happen. All the People includes the events of September 11, 2001, and a discussion of how many aspects of the terrorist attacks have brought to the forefront the qualities that keep America strong: representative democracy, freedom of speech and press, and, especially in the face of religious totalitarianism, the basic freedom of religious tolerance.</p><p>During the long freeze of the Cold War, hot wars explode.

Through the stories of Russian friends, Frazier was drawn there in the early '90s, and he soon fell in love with the country--an "embarrassing" sort of middle-aged love, an involuntary infection. What he loves is its tragedy and its humor, its stoic practicality and its near-insanity: he calls it "the greatest horrible country in the world," and Siberia is its swampy, often-frozen, and strikingly empty backyard. He took five trips there over the next dozen or so years, and <em>Travels in Siberia</em> is based on those journeys. But as in <em>Great Plains</em>, when Frazier travels he follows his own curiosity through time as well as space, telling stories of the Mongols and the Decembrists with the same amused and empathetic eye he brings to his own traveling companions. His curiosity quickly becomes yours, as does his affection for this immense and grudgingly hospitable land. <em>--Tom Nissley</em>Ian Frazier is the author of <i>Great Plains</i>, <i>On the Rez</i>, <i>Lamentations of the Father</i> and <i>Coyote V.

Sometimes that information must come from others. This may mean admitting that we are not always right, and knowing it is okay to make a mistake. A mistake, an error, a poor choice, or bad decision does not equal "there is something wrong with me." It means you are on your way to being better. We do not make mistakes on the basis of race or color. We make them because we are human.

We lie because we've been lied to -- "You're no good," "You can't do it," "You'll never make it," "How do you think you're gonna do that..." We can't think because there are so many lies running loose in our minds. The only way to eradicate a lie is with the truth. We must not only speak the truth, we must think in truth.

Whether it is a habit, behavior, relationship or fear, we know. Unfortunately, we seem powerless to stop whatever it is. Sometimes we believe we don't have the discipline or willpower to stop. The behavior becomes so habitual we do it without thinking. Other times we know exactly what it is and what we do, but we simply keep doing it anyway. We are the only ones responsible for what goes on in our lives. We can make excuses and blame others, but we are responsible to and for ourselves.

Undoubtedly the day will come when we will be forced to examine that which we have tucked away. We can willingly begin the process of examination by telling the truth to ourselves about ourselves. We all have the right to make mistakes. Our fault is being righteous about it. When we fail to admit our faults, the faults become what everyone can see. When we refuse to admit what we have done in the past, we block our path to the future.

We expend so much energy trying to fix who we are, we rarely get to really know ourselves. If we truly realized how precious the gift of life is, we would not waste a moment trying to improve it. If we really understood how precious we are to the gift of life, we would not waste time trying to fix ourselves. It's not about what we look like or what we have. It's not about fixing our face, body or lives. It's about taking what we have and doing as much as we can with it. It's about learning and growing.

It is easy to see what others do to us while we forget the drama we create for ourselves. How? Take your pick: The need to be right. Lack of life purpose. How we think others see us. Trying to fix the world. Dishonesty with self and others. Accepting someone else's truth. Seeking material wealth over spiritual values. Doing it alone. My way is the right way. Fear of the future. Negative thought patterns. Trying to prove yourself to others. Anger over the past. Telling other people what to do.

When you say I love you, it means "I want the very best for you whether or not I am included." You must acknowledge any feelings of jealousy to understand what they are. Jealousy is a signpost of the longings in your subconscious mind. It reminds you that what you are longing is also longing you. There are only two emotions, love and fear. When jealousy comes up, stop and recognize that it is actually fear raising its ugly head. Fear of losing someone or something, fear that there is not enough. If you allow yourself to be jealous, you cannot love. It is important to acknowledge all your feelings and not beat yourself up for having them. Your feelings are not good or bad, they just are. Jealousy is simply reminding you that you are worthy of the best. When you remember who you are, the jealousy will dissolve and you will be ready to receive what you want.<br><br><i>I honor my feelings no matter what they are.</i><br><br><i>January 12</i><br><br>There's absolutely no way to save people from the things in their eyes.

We were willing to try new things, go into forbidden places and take risks without hesitation. We did not believe in unhappiness, defeat, rejection or lack. We asked for what we wanted and were willing to demand that it be provided. We thought the world existed to respond to our needs. It might do us well to revert back to the ways of childhood if we want to bring some good into our lives. It's not the temper tantrums or childish outbursts we want. It is the openness and freedom from limitation we need. We have been taught to accept fear, lack, sorrow and restriction as a part of everyday life. We are afraid to make demands of life because we believe we can't have what we want. We no longer feel free to express what we feel, when we feel it. Now, we want to be everyone's friend. If only we could think like a child again, there's a good chance we would find the freedom we gave up to become adults.<br><br><i>Today, I Am a child again.</i><br><br><i>January 13</i><br><br>Heaven is where you'll be when you are okay right where you are.<br><br>Sun Ra<br><br>Pretend for a moment that you are a mink -- beautiful, valuable, precious because of the skin that covers you. Suddenly your homeland is invaded by hunters, with bats. The hunters seem kind, yet you approach them cautiously. They pet the younglings who are innocent, less cautious. As you approach your young, the hunters attack. They beat you. You are dazed, struggling for composure. The hunters steal your skin, your heritage, the very essence of your being. They leave you to die, but you survive. Your fur grows back. Stronger. More beautiful than before. Somehow it doesn't make sense. The very thing that makes you who and what you are is the source of pain. Confused, distrustful, you hide yourself or camouflage your fur, your essence. Silently you begin to curse your fur, because the hunters return again and again. You begin to understand you will never get away from being what you are. As long as you have fur, you will be hunted. The issue is: Will you curse your fur, give up and die? Or just continue to be a proud but cautious mink?<br><br><i>I will not hide who or what I Am.</i><br><br><i>January 14</i><br><br><i>Successful people succeed because they learn from their failures.<br><br>Bettina Flores</i><br><br>The most difficult things to face in life are the things you do not like about yourself. Not your ears, legs, hair or those habits and abilities you feel are not up to par. It is the ugly little things you know about yourself that need a good long look. You recognize it when you see it in others, but you make excuses for yourself. You may go to any length to cover a shortcoming, while you quickly point out the ills of another. Since the very thing you want to hide is the thing that shows itself, you need to be able to say, "I know that and I'm working on it!" It takes a loving heart, a willing mind and a sensitive spirit to get to the core of the self. But when you do, you can root out the seeds of ugliness.<br><br><i>I acknowledge, accept and embrace everything about me.</i><br><br><i>January 15</i><br><br>We [must] realize that our future lies chiefly in our own hands.<br><br>Paul Robeson<br><br>If you can blame anyone for any condition in your life, then you, not they, are digging your grave.

No matter how hard we try, we can't seem to do, say or be what others expect of us. We can't. The harder we try to pull others to us, the farther they move away. The more we try to fix things, the worse they seem to get. What we must do at these very sacred times is pull back, withdraw and prepare to grow. Our lessons are very sacred.

There are softer and less tangible part[s] of our selves that are so essential to peace, to openheartedness, to unfolding the vision and the spiritual realm of our lives, to exposing our souls.<br>- Jewel, From the Preface </blockquote><p>Writing poems and keeping journals since childhood, Jewel has been searching for truth and meaning, turning to her words to record, to discover, and to reflect.</p><p> In <em>A Night Without Armor</em>, her first collection of poetry, Jewel explores the fire of first love, the fading of passion, the giving of trust, the lessons of betrayal, and the healing of intimacy.</p><p>She delves into matters of the home, the comfort of family, the beauty of Alaska, and the dislocation of divorce.</p><p> And then there are the images of the road, the people, the bars, the planes, places exotic and mundane, loneliness and friendship.</p><p>Frank and honest, serious and suddenly playful, <em>A Night Without Armor</em> is a talented artist's intimate portrait of what makes us uniquely human.</p></p><p>Jewel Kilcher was the first to admit that this book of 100 or so of her poems would not have been published if her dazzling debut album, <i>Pieces of You</i>, hadn't sold 10 million copies. And granted, Jewel is not going to replace Deborah Garrison's <i>A Working Girl Can't Win</i> on anybody's hit parade of serious poets who write for regular people.<p> But--shockingly!--Jewel's book of poetry is solid by celeb-poet standards, and a fair bit of it is actually sort of readable in its own right. Maybe it's not a bad idea to raise your kids on an 80-acre Alaskan farm with plenty of chores and no TV, as Mr. Kilcher did. Unlike most young people, let alone overnight stars, Jewel has led a life of some intrinsic interest. While they're often prosaically straightforward, her poems about rescuing a newborn calf in the midnight snow, listening to wolves howl in a canyon storm, and racing naked out of a sauna of a winter evening bring us more useful experience than kid poets usually have to share. Some of Jewel's homesteading verse is no worse than some of Gary Snyder's late nature poems; though she'll never write nature poems remotely as good as his early work <i>Riprap</i>, neither will he, probably. Preachiness is the enemy of both poets' deep religious impulses.</p><p> Jewel's poems about dumping a lover or thrilling to parking-lot sex "between the moon and a Chevrolet" are perceptive, at points even evocative. Her ode to her own breasts as a nest for her beloved is no good, but it's an honest failure. Her dress at the Oscars was more embarrassing.</p><p> The music critics contend that Jewel's music is influenced by Joni Mitchell, though Jewel claims she didn't listen to her until lately. In comparing <i>Joni Mitchell: The Complete Poems and Lyrics</i> with Jewel's book, we find that both use the image of the cactus for a heart that resists a restricting embrace, but that Mitchell is cleverer with language. When Joni's lover is away, "Me and them lonesome blues collide / The bed's too big, / The frying pan's too wide." Meanwhile, Jewel baldly observes, "I miss you miserably, dear / and I can't quite manage / to face this unbearably / large bed / alone."</p><p> On the other hand, Jewel does conclude with a nice image for toughing it out with a sentimental gesture--she shaves her armpits with his razor and cheap hotel soap. Ow! We feel her pain. Also, Jewel's "Underage" holds its own against Mitchell's "Raised on Robbery," while demonstrating the influence that probably outweighed Mitchell in Jewel's artistic development: her dad, with whom she played gigs as a child in Alaska.</p><p> </p><blockquote> I hung out once in the bathroom of Trade Winds Harley bar in Anchorage<br> With several biker chicks for company until the cops had left.<br> They had pale skin and thick black eye makeup<br> And they asked me to sing at their weddings.<br> I said I'd ask my dad.<p> We all sat on the counter and waited for the pigs to leave.<br> Some guy OD'd and was outside foaming at the mouth.</p><p> I remember looking in the mirror<br> And seeing this white face,<br> My shirt all buttoned up.<br> The women were nice to me<br> And looked like dark angels<br> Beside me. I liked them,<br> And together we waited<br> Patiently for the cops to leave<br> So I could go back out<br> And join my dad up<br> On stage. </p></blockquote><p> The great peril for Jewel, as for most poets when very young, is artless sincerity. Her poem about her dad's Vietnam War trauma is dead sentiment, but she does far better in "Grimshaw," about a Vietvet who came to watch the Kilchers play, perpetually requesting "Ain't Goin' to Study War No More" and drinking four quarts of beer a night until the day he shot his face off. Which made little Jewel vow to deal with her own emotions sooner rather than too late.</p><p> Careless editing permitted Jewel to misspell the names of Tom Waits and Charles Bukowski and the word "peek." Most young fans won't notice, and the very poems about love troubles that older readers will find gratingly obvious will strike them as headline news to be taken to heart. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p>A bestselling writer of poetry and prose, Jewel is also an actress and performer. She has recorded four bestselling albums and also starred in Ang Lee's film <em>Ride with the Devil.</em> Her first book, <em>A Night Without Armor,</em> was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. She lives in California.</p></p><h2>What Really Happened to the Dinosaurs?</h2><p>The book that rewrites the fiction of secular dinosaur lore. Beautifully illustrated, highly imaginative.

Children will love the heartwarming story and fun-filled adventure. Adults will appreciate the scientific teaching of a biblical alternative.</p><p></p><h2>The Japanese Pottery Handbook</h2><p>Everyone interested in pottery and crafts will find this practical guide a valuable addition to both bookshelf and workshop. Penny Simpson, an English potter living in Japan, and Kanji Sodeoka, her Japanese colleague, have compiled a step-by-step manual of the way pots are made in Japan, their forms, and their decorations. The authors give a thorough account of both traditional and modern techniques and also describe in detail tools, materials, glazes, and the setup of workshops and kilns. Lucy Kitto's lettering and sprightly drawings infuse each page with life and clarity. <br><br>Pottery terms and expressions are listed with their Japanese equivalents, making it possible for the Western potter to arrive at a more intimate understanding of Japanese pottery and, when necessary, to communicate with Japanese potters in their own language. A godsend to potters, students, and collectors, this book will be especially welcome to the growing number of potters who come into direct contact with their Japanese counterparts either at home or in Japan.</p><p>Sodeoka Simpson is a Kodansha International author.Text: English, Japanese</p><h2>A City in Winter</h2><p>Driven to avenge the murder of her royal parents and reclaim their lost kingdom, a daring young princess confronts the city&#39;s conqueror, the Usurper, with the aid of two unlikely rebels. 150,000 first printing. $150,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Another ambitious and glossy collaboration between novelist Mark Helprin and illustrator Chris Van Allsburg, continuing the story of <i>Swan Lake</i>, their earlier book that recreated the ballet classic for children. Emulating Maurice Sendak's reinterpretation of <i>The Nutcracker</i>, both the earlier book and <i>A City in Winter</i> abound in winter season atmosphere and fairy tale magic. At the end of Swan Lake, the unnamed little girl who has heard the story of a prince and his beautiful lover Odette usurped from their kingdom by evil forces, realizes that she is the daughter of the pair, and the rightful heir to the kingdom. As the sequel begins, the girl is now an adult, restored to the throne as queen. She recalls her return to the city at age ten, and tells how the restoration came about.Grade 3-6-A beautiful, if pointless, book. The tale begins with a pregnant queen who is writing her story for her unborn child. She recounts the many murders in her family by the usurper, and her own quest, at age 10, to regain the throne. She speaks of the hardships of war, the grief of parting with loved ones, and the weight of meeting her responsibilities. She ends the story as the actual uprising against the usurper begins, but readers already know how things work out, so all loose ends are neatly tied together. There is a detached tone in the narrator's voice that creates a dreamy quality, which allows readers to move through the story without actually getting involved in it. That dreaminess carries over into the images Helprin uses, and the surreal twists and turns of this convoluted plot. The text, which ranges from tedious double talk to smug inner musings by the child queen, plods along with a destination in mind, though it is too obviously manipulated in several places. Helprin's writing style does add a certain richness to the text; however, it is merely frosting on a cardboard cake. The characters are dismally shallow. Van Allsburg's 13 illustrations are done in his typical style-odd angles, somber colors, and high definition. They competently reflect the text but have the same sterile feel as the narrative. As a story to be cherished by readers of any age, this offering simply doesn't work. It is much too complicated for the elementary crowd and older readers capable of wading through it will undoubtedly prefer something with more substance. J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, or Susan Cooper, to name a few, provide far better tales.<br><i>Patricia A.

From World War II to the Cold War, Angleton operated beyond the view of the public, Congress, and even the president. He unwittingly shared intelligence secrets with Soviet spy Kim Philby, a member of the notorious Cambridge spy ring. He launched mass surveillance by opening the mail of hundreds of thousands of Americans. He abetted a scheme to aid Israel&#x2019;s own nuclear efforts, disregarding U.S. security. He committed perjury and obstructed the JFK assassination investigation. He oversaw a massive spying operation on the antiwar and black nationalist movements and he initiated an obsessive search for communist moles that nearly destroyed the Agency. </p><p>In <i>The Ghost,</i> investigative reporter Jefferson Morley tells Angleton&#x2019;s dramatic story, from his friendship with the poet Ezra Pound through the underground gay milieu of mid-century Washington to the Kennedy assassination to the Watergate scandal. From the agency&#x2019;s MKULTRA mind-control experiments to the wars of the Mideast, Angleton wielded far more power than anyone knew. Yet during his seemingly lawless reign in the CIA, he also proved himself to be a formidable adversary to our nation&#x2019;s enemies, acquiring a mythic stature within the CIA that continues to this day.</p></p><p>JEFFERSON MORLEY is a journalist and editor who has worked in Washington journalism for over thirty years, fifteen of which were spent as an editor and reporter at <i>The Washington Post. </i>The author of <i>Our Man in Mexico, </i>a biography of the CIA&#x2019;s Mexico City station chief Winston Scott, Morley has written about intelligence, military, and political subjects for<i> Salon, The Atlantic, </i>and<i> The Intercept, </i>among others. He is the editor of JFK Facts, a blog. He lives in Washington, DC.<p>&#x201c;The best book ever written about the strangest CIA chief who ever lived.

Rosie Jones is boss of the cowboys and presides over a neat, cozy little ranch where Fancy Dan, Salad Sam, One-Leg Smith, Singing Sid, Mad McGhee and Utah Jim "Work extremely hard, to stop her getting cross." Their exaggerated hats are tall enough to hold at least 10 gallons and, of course, are light in color, if not white. In darker, but equally tall hats, are Greasy Ben and his band of ruffians. Each page contains one or two quatrains and Gerrard's characteristically clever, charming, and detailed watercolor illustrations. As the good guys chase the bad, double-page spreads present panoramic views of mountains, canyons, and cactus. Pages with a great deal of white space follow, while Rosie and the cowboys figure out how to capture Greasy Ben without a fight. Gerrard, in his usual fashion, has captured a child's view of a western adventure in which sleeping on the hard and lumpy ground, morning baths in a stream, and eating beans for breakfast are made important. Details in the illustrations of the bunk house combine the motifs of the West with homey images of a teddy bear, family portraits, and picture books. One is reminded of dioramas when turning these pages: miniatures of ranch, desert, and town that enable viewers to walk right in and be a part of it all. Gerrard uses rich browns, blues, and pale greens with touches of reds, reaching children with little details that will make them giggle and even explode into laughter. --Kay E. Vandergrift, School of Communication, Information and Library Studies, Rutgers Univ . , New Brunswick, NJ<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.In PW 's words, "Gerrard transports his comic and lumpish figures across the Atlantic to tell a Western tale. As usual, his humor is understated and droll. The good guys win out in this straight-faced comedy that . . . is 'enormous fun.'

Her many honors include induction into the James Beard Foundation Cookbook Hall of Fame, a Life Achievement Award from the International Association of Cooking Professionals, the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle, and the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)."Diana&#x2019;s recipe for her most personal cookbook includes equal parts passion, creativity, and humor, with a soup�on of provocation. I love the way she&#x2019;s so blunt in her comments about food and the food world, her b�tes noires, in this book&#x2014;it&#x2019;s exactly the way we cooks talk to each other in private, and it rarely gets into our books." (Paula Wolfert, author of The Food of Morocco)<br><br>"Nothing Fancy gives us access to the razor-sharp wit and wisdom of one of the great intuitive cooks of our time. Diana Kennedy knows more than you and me, and perhaps the most important reason is&#x2014;now, listen up, all you good home and professional cooks&#x2014;she knows how to use salt, which could hardly be more important.

Le Guin's Earthsea is a stunning fantasy world that grabs quickly at our hearts, pulling us deeply into its imaginary realms. Four books (<i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>, <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and <i>Tehanu</i>) tell the whole Earthsea cycle--a tale about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Le Guin challenges her readers to think about the power of language, how in the act of naming the world around us we actually create that world. Teens, especially, will be inspired by the way Le Guin allows her characters to evolve and grow into their own powers. <p> In this second book of Le Guin's Earthsea series, readers will meet Tenar, a priestess to the "Nameless Ones" who guard the catacombs of the Tombs of Atuan. Only Tenar knows the passageways of this dark labyrinth, and only <b>she</b> can lead the young wizard Sparrowhawk, who stumbles into its maze, to the greatest treasure of all. Will she?</p>Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea cycle has become one of the best-loved fantasies of our time. The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Middle Earth</i> or C.S. Lewis'<i>Narnia</i>. The magnificent saga begins with <i>A Wizard Of Earthsea</i>, continues in <i>The Tombs Of Atuan</i> and <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and concludes with <i>Tehanu</i> --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry. When she was still a child, Tenar was stripped of her name and family and dedicated as high priestess to the Nameless Ones, dark powers of <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>. This is the tale of the young wizard, Ged, who came to the forbidden labyrinth to steal its greatest treasure--the Ring of Erreth-Akbe--and stayed to set Tenar free and lead her out of darkness.</p><h2>Elephants Can Remember (Hercule Poirot)</h2><p>A tenacious mystery writer calls on his old friend, the redoubtable Hercule Poirot, to help him reopen the twelve-year-old case of Lord and Lady Ravenscroft, whose mysterious deaths were ruled a double homicide. Reissue.</p><p><p>Hercule Poirot stood on the clifftop. Here, many years earlier, there had been a fatal accident. This was followed by the grisly discovery of two bodies&#x2014;a husband and wife who had been shot dead.</p><p>But who had killed whom? Was it a suicide pact? A crime of passion? Or cold-blooded murder? Poirot delves into the past and discovers that &#x201c;old sins leave long shadows.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Dame Agatha Christie </b>(1890-1976) was a British crime writer best known for her detective novels and short stories. According to <i>Guinness World Records</i>, she is the best-selling novelist of all time, her novels having sold over four billion copies and having been translated into more than one hundred languages. The Agatha Award for best mystery and crime writers was named in her honor.</p><br><br><p><b>Hugh Fraser</b> is an English actor and theater director who is best known for his portrayal of Captain Hastings in the television series <i>Agatha Christie's Poirot</i>.

It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good, and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt.<br><br>Ph�dre n� Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond was purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission--and the first to recognize her for who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel's Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one.<br>Ph�dre has trained in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Having stumbled upon a plot that threatened the very foundations of her homeland, she gave up almost everything she held dear to save it. She survived, and lived to have others tell her story, and if they embellished the tale with fabric of mythical splendor, they weren't far off the mark.<br><br>The hands of the gods weigh heavily upon Ph�dre's brow, and they are not yet done with their charge--for while the young queen who sits upon the throne is well loved by the people, there are those who believe that other heads should wear the crown. And those who escaped the wrath of the mighty are not yet done with their schemes for power and revenge. To protect and serve, Ph�dre will once again leave her beloved homeland. <br><br>From the sun-drenched villas of La Serenissima to the wilds of old Hellas, from a prison designed to drive the very gods mad to an island of immutable joy. Ph�dre will meet old friends and new enemies and discover a plot so dreadful as to make the earth tremble, masterminded by the one person she cannot turn away from.<br></p><p>In this engrossing adult fantasy tale, the fascinating Ph�dre n� Delaunay fights to save her queen and country in a battle whose greatest weapon proves to be Ph�dre herself. This sequel to Carey's accomplished debut novel, <i>Kushiel's Dart</i>, finds Ph�dre, now Comtesse de Montr�ve, once again plying her skills as an <i>anguissette</i>--a courtesan for whom pain becomes pleasure--and her talents as a spy. She uncovers a conspiracy of treason and murder and begins an adventure that takes her once more to distant lands in the company of an intriguing cast of characters--and a new confrontation with her old enemy, Melisande Shahrizai.<p> There's some evidence of haste in this novel: the writing is not always as tight and controlled as it was in <i>Kushiel's Dart</i>. Nevertheless, Carey's fans will certainly enjoy this return to Terre d'Ange, and those new to her work will find a satisfying combination of fantasy, sex, and adventure, as well as a smart and engaging heroine. <i>--Roz Genessee</i></p>Born in 1964, Jacqueline Carey was an avid reader since early childhood.

Nor was it said by Marge Schott in the 1980s. Nor by Bowie Kuhn or Calvin Griffith in the 1970s or Walter O'Malley in the 1960s. Those prophetic words were uttered by none other than the great Ty Cobb - in 1925.<br>John Helyar, reporter for The Wall Street Journal and co-author of the number one bestseller Barbarians at the Gate, says in Lords of the Realm, "Before it was a business, it was a game." But as Helyar discovered, and as he shows in his extraordinary new book, baseball has also been a business for a long, long time.<br>Lords of the Realm is not a sobersided look at the problems of high salaries and free agency. It's also not a romantic homage to the heroes of the game. It is a penetrating, take-no-prisoners look at the hundred-year history of what's become a billion-dollar machine, a cutthroat industry that, while supposedly capturing the soul of America, is and has always been dominated by such greed, back-stabbing, and double-dealing that it puts the insanity of the RJR Nabisco takeover to shame.<br>As Richard Moss, a baseball agent, has said about his chosen line of work: "There's so much money and so many good people. Why does this work so badly?" After hundreds of interviews and several years of research and digging, John Helyar knows the answer to Moss's question - and lays it all out before us in a way that is both horrific and hilarious.<br>From the despotic lunacy of Gussie Busch, George Steinbrenner, and Peter Ueberroth and the maverick antics of Branch Rickey, Charlie Finley, and Ted Turner to the chaotic, yet near-heroic rise of the union, the ever-more-mysterious dealings that baseball maintains with television, and the murky back-room maneuvers behind collusion, expansion, and the battle for and against profit-sharing, Lords of the Realm is an utterly compelling, picaresque epic that perhaps does discover the real soul of America.</p><p><i>Wall Street Journal</i> sports reporter (and <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i> co-author) John Helyar has produced an entertaining and concise look at the real reasons that Major League Baseball has become the big business that it is today--and a definitive glimpse at where America's erstwhile national pastime is likely to head in the coming years. With vividly painted portraits of significant players from Ty Cobb to Bud Selig, it offers both a current picture and an historical perspective that will prove invaluable to fans of the game as well as to students of business as the lords of the game continue to struggle with business problems that have forever altered their sport.inating, colorful chronicle -- based on hundreds of interviews and years of research and digging -- John Helyar brings to vivid life the extraordinary people and dramatic events that shaped America's favorite pastime, from the dead-ball days at the turn of the century through the great strike of 1994.

Orlean, a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker </i>who has been hailed as &#x201c;a national treasure&#x201d; by <i>The Washington Post</i>, spent nearly ten years researching and reporting her most captivating book to date: the story of a dog who was born in 1918 and never died. <br><br>It begins on a battlefield in France during World War I, when a young American soldier, Lee Duncan, discovered a newborn German shepherd in the ruins of a bombed-out dog kennel. To Duncan, who came of age in an orphanage, the dog&#x2019;s survival was a miracle. He saw something in Rin Tin Tin that he felt compelled to share with the world. Duncan brought Rinty home to California, where the dog&#x2019;s athleticism and acting ability drew the attention of Warner Bros. Over the next ten years, Rinty starred in twenty-three blockbuster silent films that saved the studio from bankruptcy and made him the most famous dog in the world. At the height of his popularity, Rin Tin Tin was Hollywood&#x2019;s number one box office star. <br><br>During the decades that followed, Rinty and his descendants rose and fell with the times, making a tumultuous journey from silent films to talkies, from black-and-white to color, from radio programs to one of the most popular television shows of the baby boom era, <i>The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin</i>. The canine hero&#x2019;s legacy was cemented by Duncan and a small group of others&#x2014;including Bert Leonard, the producer of the TV series, and Daphne Hereford, the owner of the current Rin Tin Tin&#x2014;who have dedicated their lives to making sure the dog&#x2019;s legend will never die. <br><br>At its core, <i>Rin Tin Tin </i>is a poignant exploration of the enduring bond between humans and animals. It is also a richly textured history of twentieth-century entertainment and entrepreneurship. It spans ninety years and explores everything from the shift in status of dogs from working farmhands to beloved family members, from the birth of obedience training to the evolution of dog breeding, from the rise of Hollywood to the past and present of dogs in war. Filled with humor and heart and moments that will move you to tears, Susan Orlean&#x2019;s first original book since <i>The Orchid Thief </i>is an irresistible blend of history, human interest, and masterful storytelling&#x2014;a dazzling celebration of a great American dog by one of our most gifted writers.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Garth Stein Reviews <em>Rin Tin Tin</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Garth Stein is the author of <em>The Art of Racing in the Rain</em> and <em>How Evan Broke His Head and Other Secrets</em> . </strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>I have no cultural or historical reason to be interested in Rin Tin Tin: I was not born in the 1920's when Rinty was a silent film star; I was not swept up in the dog obedience training craze of the 50's; as a child, I was warned that German shepherds were a mean and violent sort and I should stay away from them; while I spent a lot of time watching television when I was a kid in the 60's (most of it on a black &amp;;amp white Zenith with rabbit ears and a knob you would use to change the channel--remember knobs?), I am still non-plused by the fact that I never--not even once--saw an episode of the <em>Rin Tin Tin</em> television show. Why then did I find this book utterly engaging? </p> <p>I remember my Calculus teacher raising a question in class one day many years ago: is math something that is created, or is it discovered? As a teenager, I found the question quite provocative. And I couldn't help but ponder the question again--though in a different context--as I read the absolutely fascinating history of <em>Rin Tin Tin</em>, as told by Susan Orlean. Is a hero, an icon, a star, a cultural phenomenon created, or discovered?</p> <p>Surely, Lee Duncan "found" the first Rin Tin Tin. And he set about training his dog, and he made the rounds in Hollywood with Rinty, knocking on doors, looking to be discovered. But he did so with such determination, one wonders if it were the idea of Rin Tin Tin or the dog, himself, that inspired Duncan. In other words, was the concept of Rin Tin Tin bigger than the dog from the very beginning?</p> <p>As the story of Rinty unfolds, we realize that his history is a clear reflection of the history of film in the 20th Century, as well as the history of popular culture during the same period. From the beginnings of the moving picture, silent films, talkies, the advent of color, and then the innovation called television, Rinty was reimagined to adapt to the changing media, and continued to find his way into the hearts of Americans.</p> <p>What I find most interesting is that Rin Tin Tin's biggest champions, Lee Duncan and Bert Leonard, pursued the Rin Dynasty (there were many, many generations of Rin Tin Tins), at great personal cost. And while they got paid, to be sure, their compensation was never commensurate with their efforts. Rather, they both felt a greater duty to disseminate the message of Rin Tin Tin; personal gain was a secondary consideration. They felt that what they were doing was a service to society. That the story of Rin, and, then again, the stories Rin told, were life-affirming, healing, and inspiring, and that is what a damaged world needed.</p> <p>Though Lee Duncan proclaimed Rin Tin Tin to be immortal, his downfall did come, and with it, the downfall of Duncan, and later of Leonard and others who tried to keep the dynasty alive. Did we, as a society, simply outgrow Rin Tin Tin? Was he undone by computer graphics technology, short attention spans, loss of ability to suspend disbelief, and a skeptical inability to anthropomorphize? Or did we simply heal the wounds inflicted by world wars and atrocities of the last century? Did Rin Tin Tin, who was found on the battlefield in World War I, come to the aid of an ailing society, and, having provided solace to the people, simply serve his purpose and move on? One can argue either point, but I like to think the latter is more fitting. And I like to think that the love and devotion of a dog named Rin Tin Tin helped us greatly in our healing.</p> <p>There were many Rin Tin Tins, and sometimes dogs who weren't even Rintys played Rinty on television and in the movies. Because Rin Tin Tin, the hero, is larger than any one dog.</p> <p>Was the hero discovered or was he invented? I think a little of both. For certainly it was good fortune that Lee Duncan stumbled upon the dog, Rin Tin Tin, in France. But it was hard work, clever marketing, and sensitivity and understanding of the larger issues with which our society struggled that made the dog a hero. Having the key to the door is not enough; one must know to unlock the door and step through.</p> <p><em>Rin Tin Tin</em> is a wonderful, compelling book that will have you thinking long after you've set it down. Susan Orlean has created a fascinating history of a dog, yes, but she has also opened a discussion of many larger issues, which are highly relevant and provocative.

Rosenberg is that rare combination of surgeon and research scientist who early on decided he wanted to take on the challenge of cancer. His patients are all terminal, all failures to chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. His idea: attack the cancer cells with the body's own immune cells--in particular the specialized T lymphocytes capable of killing cells. The rub was how to get quantities of these cells, ensure that they would attack the cancer cells and only the cancer cells, not produce dire side effects, and achieve long-lasting effects. To do all this, Rosenberg and his team at the National Institutes of Health had to surmount enormous hurdles: extracting T cells from animals and humans, priming them to grow in tissue culture, making sure they retained their killing ability, infusing them back into the live animals and humans.... The work, the frustration, the day-to-day drudgery and disappointments are all told here, with the occasional moment of triumph that galvanizes the team. The story unfolds with the discovery of new families of growth factors--the interleukins- -and a new breed of lymphocyte: the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte. There's also a commercial story with a competition between biotech companies and, as techniques evolve, a gene-therapy story involving inserting foreign genes into patients' T cells to increase their potency. And then there are the patients, all graphically presented. Many were not helped, but enough have survived, their tumors melted away, to demonstrate that there's a new and powerful cancer therapy on the horizon. And that there are scientists like Rosenberg doing their all to make the therapy work. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Things were not going as he had hoped. The race, between Katharine Lee, First Lady of the United States, and Senator Henry Carson of Virginia, seemed to be a dead heat.</p><p>Kate Lee and her husband, President Will Lee, were Stone&#x2019;s friends, and he had looked forward to their invitation to spend election night in the family quarters with a couple of dozen good friends. He had not looked forward to seeing her lose the race to a cardboard cutout of a Republican senator, which was how he saw Henry Carson, known in the Lee campaign as Honk, due to a failed attempt to get the nation to think of him as a Hank, instead of a Henry. A mispronunciation by a French official had rechristened him.</p><p>Ann Keaton, the Lee deputy campaign manager, to whom Stone was very, very close, came and sat beside him.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you feel about all this?&#x201d; he asked Ann.</p><p>&#x201c;Nauseous,&#x201d; she replied.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not getting the turnout our pollsters told us to expect,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Young people and independents are not voting in the numbers we had hoped. At least, that&#x2019;s what our exit polling is telling us. Also, Florida is taking a hell of a long time to count. They&#x2019;ve got a Republican governor, and we&#x2019;re worried about hanky-panky. It could be Bush&#x2013;Gore all over again. On top of that, Ohio is neck and neck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The West Coast polls close in ten minutes,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Those states should give Kate a boost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They should, yes, but California can&#x2019;t put her over the top, if Florida and Ohio go the other way. This could be a very big upset.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; Stone said, pointing at the TV. Chris Matthews and Tom Brokaw were on screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Based on our own exit polling and with eighty-nine percent of the precincts reporting,&#x201d; Brokaw was saying, &#x201c;our desk is calling Florida for Senator Henry Carson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!!!&#x201d; came a shout from around the room. &#x201c;Not possible!&#x201d; Senator Sam Meriwether of Georgia, Kate&#x2019;s campaign manager, yelled.</p><p>&#x201c;Easy, Sam,&#x201d; Will Lee said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not necessarily over because a network has called it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;CBS has called it that way, too, but ABC is holding out,&#x201d; a woman watching another TV set called.</p><p>&#x201c;Fox called it for Honk half an hour ago,&#x201d; somebody said.</p><p>&#x201c;I regard that as encouraging,&#x201d; Stone said, and everybody laughed, releasing some tension in the room.</p><p>Kate Lee emerged from the Presidential Bedroom with a coat over her shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get over to the armory,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to make a statement soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not over yet,&#x201d; her husband said.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Kate said, kissing him, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d better be ready.&#x201d; She started for the door, two Secret Service agents in tow.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute!&#x201d; Sam Meriwether shouted. &#x201c;CBS is reconsidering their call.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate stopped. &#x201c;Have they reversed themselves?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but they&#x2019;re saying that Florida is back in the undecided column.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That has to be a good sign,&#x201d; Ann said to Stone.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;New totals from Florida,&#x201d; Sam called out. &#x201c;With ninety-six percent of precincts reporting, Kate leads by three thousand votes!&#x201d;</p><p>Kate walked back toward the TV set. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too narrow a margin. What precincts haven&#x2019;t reported?&#x201d;</p><p>Sam pointed at a north Florida county.</p><p>&#x201c;That county is nearly all African-American,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;It should be ours by a big margin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking hanky-panky,&#x201d; Sam said.</p><p>&#x201c;Have we got anybody in the courthouse there?&#x201d;</p><p>As they watched, cars pulled up in the courthouse square and men in suits got out.</p><p>&#x201c;Republicans?&#x201d; somebody asked.</p><p>&#x201c;FBI agents! I see badges.&#x201d;</p><p>The men swept into the courthouse.</p><p>Will came and stood beside Kate. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d better get over to the armory. They&#x2019;ve got a comfortable room for you to wait in there. Don&#x2019;t do anything precipitous.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate kissed him again and ran for the door.</p><p>&#x201c;The West Coast has closed,&#x201d; somebody called.</p><p>&#x201c;MSNBC is backing away from their call in Florida,&#x201d; somebody else said.</p><p>&#x201c;What do they know that we don&#x2019;t?&#x201d; Stone asked Ann.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anymore,&#x201d; Ann said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m through reading exit polls and guessing. We&#x2019;ll know soon anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One precinct in north Florida has reported and that, alone, has widened Katharine Lee&#x2019;s lead by another two thousand points,&#x201d; Chris Matthews said. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re hearing that they&#x2019;ll have a statewide count at any minute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s some good news for the Lee campaign,&#x201d; Brokaw said. &#x201c;Now that the polls in the West have closed, we can tell you that our exit polls show Katharine Lee winning California by nearly thirty points.&#x201d;</p><p>A cheer went up around the room.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a report from Ohio,&#x201d; Brokaw said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to Amy Roberts there. Amy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tom, this is official. All Ohio votes are in, and Kate Lee has won by less than twenty thousand votes!&#x201d;</p><p>There was a roar of glee from the people present. Will Lee was on his cell phone, and everybody knew who he was calling.</p><p>Five minutes later, Florida came in with a final vote. &#x201c;Katharine Lee has won Florida by thirty-one thousand votes!&#x201d; Chris Matthew said. &#x201c;We can now call the election. The next president of the United States will be Katharine Lee!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will,&#x201d; Stone called, &#x201c;did you reach Kate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and she&#x2019;s hearing that Henry Carson is about to speak.&#x201d;</p><p>Carson came on camera before a big crowd and waved for silence. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we haven&#x2019;t heard from Guam, yet.&#x201d; His crowd both laughed and moaned. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s clear that our next president will be Kate Lee. I congratulate her for the campaign she ran and the victory she has won. I will do all I can to help her.&#x201d;</p><p>The TV switched now to the armory, where Kate was making her way to the podium. Will was not with her by design; he had wanted her to accept or concede on her own terms. She stood for nearly ten minutes, waving at the crowd and waiting for the noise to die down. Eventually, the floor was hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you all,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and my thanks to every American who voted today, no matter for whom. Once again, we are on the brink of new leadership in our country, just the way the framers of the Constitution wanted it. I promise you the best government I can put together, and I invite our Republican friends to help us make this country better than ever!&#x201d; Finally, when she could speak again, she said, &#x201c;Will, I know you&#x2019;re watching. Unpack!&#x201d;</p><p>Back at the family quarters, people were pounding Will Lee on the back and opening more champagne.</p><p>Stone sank into the sofa, relieved and grateful, happy to be in this room on this night.</p><p>Stone felt Ann ease from his bed, then heard her get into a robe and slip from the Lincoln Bedroom. He looked at the clock. Half past five.</p><p>Wide awake now, he got out of bed and into some trousers and a shirt, then left the room, looking for coffee, following the scent. He walked into the big oval room and found a table of pastries and a coffee urn. He drew himself a mugful and turned to find a seat.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; a female voice said.</p><p>Stone turned to find Kate Lee sunk into an armchair, coffee in her hand. &#x201c;Good morning, Madame President-Elect,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;May I be the ten thousandth to congratulate you?&#x201d; He took a chair facing hers.</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t sleep,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Will is out like a light, but my mind is still racing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For years I couldn&#x2019;t let myself believe this could happen, and now it has, and I still can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Enjoy your disbelief,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It will get real soon enough.&#x201d;</p><p>She checked her watch. &#x201c;Right now, it&#x2019;s just another early morning at home. In a couple of hours all hell will break loose. I must remember to find time to write in my journal today.&#x201d; She patted her belly. &#x201c;He/she will want to read that someday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You still don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m out of fashion, but I don&#x2019;t want to know until I can hold him/her in my arms. Neither does Will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe this is callously political of me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I think your being pregnant is going to be a material advantage to your presidency.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t allowed myself to think of that,&#x201d; Kate replied. &#x201c;How an advantage?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be hard for your opponents to criticize a pregnant woman,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve noticed that men are very delicate with women who are carrying a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true in its way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you should try to get as much as possible accomplished before you give birth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After that, I&#x2019;ll just be another mom, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Men aren&#x2019;t afraid to argue with their moms.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate laughed. &#x201c;God knows I wasn&#x2019;t afraid to argue with mine. What about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I learned early on that my mother had an annoying tendency to be right. It was daunting, and I thought twice before I opposed her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were a smart boy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she used to tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stone, I want to appoint you to something.&#x201d;</p><p>He held up a hand. &#x201c;No, please, Kate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up. This is your president-elect speaking. You are now, officially, the first member of my Kitchen Cabinet.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone laughed. &#x201c;How could I not accept that post? I&#x2019;m honored beyond words.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you will serve for the entire eight years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s thinking ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A president can get things done in a first term, but she needs a second to keep her opponents from dismantling her accomplishments.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a narrow majority in both houses&#x2014;that should help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The next congressional campaign starts today,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and so does my charm offensive with Republican congresspeople and senators. They may vote against me a lot of the time, but I&#x2019;m going to make their hearts break when they do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard Ann sneak back to her room a few minutes ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oops.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy that you two were able to get together for a while, and, believe me, I&#x2019;m sorry that I&#x2019;m going to be keeping you apart for a long time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you. We&#x2019;ve talked about that, and we know it has to be done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is it the mafiosi say? This is the business we&#x2019;ve chosen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ann knows that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad she does.&#x201d; Kate got to her feet. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll be around for a few days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I have to get back. I&#x2019;ve been away from my desk for too long, what with the Paris trip, and I flew a borrowed airplane down here that has to be returned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear you bought a house in Paris.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did, and I have to be careful about doing that every time I get a little depressed. If you and Will ever need a hideaway, it will be waiting for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s sweet of you,&#x201d; Kate said, patting his cheek, &#x201c;but the only hideaway we&#x2019;re going to have is the one we have now at Camp David. And that&#x2019;s sort of like a White House in the woods. We&#x2019;ll take you up on your Paris house when they kick us out of town.&#x201d; She kissed him on the forehead and padded out of the room.</p><p>Stone thought maybe he should start a journal of his own.</p><p>Stone said his goodbyes to Ann over a second cup of coffee and was back in his home office in New York in time for a sandwich at his desk, while he went through mail and phone messages. Joan stuck her head in. &#x201c;Herbie Fisher wants to come by after lunch to catch up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. He&#x2019;s been keeping an eye on my clients.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting to get phone calls from people that sound like they want your ear, because you know our new president.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sighed. &#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s inevitable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Especially when your name is on the Lees&#x2019; guest list for the White House on election night. Did you really sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did, and quite well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it like?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very Victorian. Lincoln never slept there, but he used it as an office.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any ghosts?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was sleeping too soundly to notice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s our Kate looking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just great. Didn&#x2019;t you watch her on TV?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, I did.&#x201d; The phone rang and she went to answer it.</p><p>Stone found four letters in his mail that alluded to his friendship with the Lees, and he dictated perfunctory replies.</p><p>Herbert Fisher turned up at two o&#x2019;clock, with a catalog case full of files to return.

Pierpont Morgan bestrode the financial world like a colossus. The organizing force behind General Electric, U.S. Steel, and vast railroad empires, he served for decades as America's unofficial central banker: a few months after he died in 1913, the Federal Reserve replaced the private system he had devised. An early supporter of Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie, the confidant (and rival) of Theodore Roosevelt, England's Edward VII, and Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, and the companion of several fascinating women, Morgan shaped his world and ours in countless ways. Yet since his death he has remained a mysterious figure, celebrated as a hero of industrial progress and vilified as a rapacious robber baron.<br><br>Here for the first time is the biography Morgan has long deserved--a magisterial, full-scale portrait of the man without whose dominating will American finance and culture would be very different from what they are today. In this beautifully crafted account, drawn from more than a decade's work in newly available archives, the award-winning biographer Jean Strouse animates Morgan's life and times to reveal the entirely human character behind the often terrifying visage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Morgan</b> brings eye-opening perspectives to the role the banker played in the emerging U.S. economy as he raised capital in Europe, reorganized bankrupt railroads, stabilized markets in times of crisis, and set up many of the corporate and financial structures we take for granted. And surprising new stories introduce us in vivid detail to Morgan's childhood in Hartford and Boston, his schooling in Switzerland and Germany, the start of his career in New York--as well as to his relations with his esteemed and exacting father, with his adored first and difficult second wives, with his children, partners, business associates, female consorts, and friends. Morgan had a second major career as a collector of art, stocking America with visual and literary treasures of the past. Called by one contemporary expert "the greatest collector of our time," he spent much of his energy and more than half of his fortune on art.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Strouse's extraordinary biography gives dramatic new dimension not only to Morgan but to the culture, political struggles, and social conflicts of America's momentous Gilded Age.</p><p>As Americans cope with the social and industrial changes wrought by the computer age, we seem ready to view with more sympathy the men who shaped the similarly disruptive economic revolution at the turn of the last century. Less than a year after <i>Titan</i>, Ron Chernow's sweeping biography of capitalist par excellence John D. Rockefeller, comes Jean Strouse's searching analysis of J.P. Morgan (1837-1913), the merchant banker whose financial prowess enabled the great American businesses to grow and thrive. Like Chernow, Strouse takes a nuanced view of a man reviled by his contemporaries as a sinister monopolist. Morgan sought to stabilize the volatile American economy and raise the cash needed to fuel its meteoric expansion. His methods were controversial, particularly his fondness for industrial "combinations" that dampened competition, but Strouse's lucid r�sum� of the historical backdrop illuminates the thinking behind Morgan's actions. As in her groundbreaking biography <i>Alice James</i>, the author never settles for received wisdom, instead reading previously neglected documents with a sharp eye to offer a fresh interpretation. She vividly limns Morgan's imperious personality and such extracurricular interests as his superb art collection. But it's Strouse's ability to clearly convey complex financial material that distinguishes this book. Her chapter on the panic of 1907, which Morgan was instrumental in halting, is as exciting as a good thriller and far more instructive. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br>"Jean Strouse is one of the foremost biographers in America--a fine scholar and a natural writer, with the imaginative sensitivity to see below the surface of events and the intellectual power to give brilliant narrative coherence to what she sees. Pierpont Morgan, the central banker of the United States before the Great War, was one of the most contradictory public figures of the Gilded Age.

Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore's Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort, <i>The Hunt For Red October</i>, sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it "the perfect yarn." From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.<br><br>A native of Texas, <b>Marc Cameron</b> spent twenty-nine years in law enforcement. He served as a uniformed police officer, mounted (horse patrol) officer, SWAT officer, and a US Marshal. Cameron is conversant in Japanese, and travels extensively researching his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Jericho Quinn novels.<p>Jack Ryan, Jr., sat behind the wheel of a dusty Ford Taurus and rubbed a hand through his dark brown beard, trying not to think about his growing need to pee. The car sat parked for the fourth time in seven hours, and Ryan rested both hands on the steering wheel, staring into the darkness. Dallas, Texas, had a reputation for being muggy, even in fall, but this September night had turned out cool, allowing the two men in the Taurus to keep their windows rolled up most of the way and the AC turned off.&nbsp;</p><p>Just two years old, the dented Ford looked to be in much worse shape than it actually was. The Taurus was one of the few models that could be a police car, or, with a quick coat of rattle-can black and some judiciously applied dents to the doors and fenders, become a ratty beater that those same police would see as a meth fleet vehicle. Despite being in dependable shape mechanically, this particular car stank like bad cheese and dirty gym socks&#x2014;blending well into this seedy South Dallas neighborhood.</p><p>A quick Internet search had revealed that the intersection not three blocks away was among the top five most likely spots in Dallas to get stabbed. There&#x2019;d been no stabbings tonight as far as Ryan knew, but the night was still young. The sound of bottles breaking on pavement not too far down the street signaled that a cutting, at the very least, was a distinct possibility.</p><p>Ryan tapped the steering wheel with his thumbs and looked at his watch. His need for relief was going to reach critical mass in the next few minutes. He had a Gatorade bottle in the backseat, stashed there for surveillance emergencies, but he really hoped to get out and stretch his legs for a minute&#x2014;even if it was behind a stinking dumpster that overflowed with pizza boxes in an alley littered with broken syringes and used condoms.</p><p>During the forty-two minutes they&#x2019;d been parked between the back door of a Mexican grocery and a store that sold �sewing machines&#x2014;of all things&#x2014;Jack had seen a half-dozen guys&#x2014;all Asian&#x2014;go into the Casita Roja strip club across the street. Over the course of those same forty-two minutes, he&#x2019;d watched a homeless dude stagger by and vomit all over himself, a graffiti artist tag the back of the sewing-machine shop, and two hookers entertain clients as they stood against the rough brick wall beside the dumpster, accompanied by a halo of moths fluttering under the sad glow of a feeble streetlamp.</p><p><i>&#x201c;If you could see me now, Mother dear,&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;Ryan mumbled to himself, tapping the Taurus&#x2019;s armrest.</p><p>&#x201c;You say something?&#x201d; Bartosz &#x201c;Midas&#x201d; Jankowski asked from the passenger seat. Like Jack, he was bearded and wore a loose button-down shirt with short sleeves to cover the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Shield pistol tucked inside his waistband, as well as the loop of copper wire he wore low around his neck. Hollywood would have everyone believe the entire communication package, including the mic and radio, could be wrapped up and fit into the tiny bit of plastic worn inside the ear. Ryan wished it were that simple. There were tiny mics, but they still required a radio and some kind of power source. Campus members used a Profilo wire near-field �neck-loop mic and a small flesh-tone earpiece. A house-built voice-�activated intercom system obviated the use of a PTT switch. The whole shebang ran off a Motorola radio about the size of a fat deck of playing cards.</p><p>&#x201c;Just thinking about this sexy life of a spy,&#x201d; Ryan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to need to take a leak in a few.&#x201d;</p><p>Four other sets of ears listened to the conversation over the encrypted net. Ryan had hoped Midas might admit he needed a relief break as well, to make him feel a little more human in his time of need. No such luck. Jankowski was relatively new to The Campus, but Jack had been on enough ops with the retired Delta Force commander to know he possessed a bladder the size of a watermelon.</p><p>&#x201c;I went an hour ago,&#x201d; Domingo &#x201c;Ding&#x201d; Chavez&#x2019;s voice came over Jack&#x2019;s earpiece, gloating a little. &#x201c;When I slapped the microphone up.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez, a senior member of The Campus&#x2014;and a former CIA officer&#x2014;had made an educated guess about their target&#x2019;s next stop, and arrived in just enough time to stick a magnetic hi-gain microphone to the light fixture outside the&nbsp;doors of the Casita Roja. About the size of a matchbox, the little mic broadcast on the scrambled radio frequency of the team&#x2019;s net. It was surprising what useful intelligence could be picked up from people just before they walked through the door of an unfamiliar location. Even when alone, they sometimes just blurted out things to themselves.</p><p>Chavez continued to rub it in. &#x201c;I had me a few sips of a cold one while I was inside. Had to blend in, you know, go with the flow.&#x201d; He made no comment about the nude girls gyrating on the stage. His father-in-law, The Campus&#x2019;s director of operations, John Clark&#x2014;a legend in the intelligence community&#x2014;happened to be working overwatch on this op from the roof of a payday loan place halfway up the block with a good view of both the front door of Casita Roja and Ryan&#x2019;s Taurus. He was listening on the same net.</p><p>Ryan sighed. &#x201c;Maybe I should go in and try to get a listen on what our guy&#x2019;s talking about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Negative,&#x201d; Clark said. &#x201c;We have the tracker on his car and we&#x2019;re up on his phone. Right now we&#x2019;re just building patterns.&#x201d;</p><p>Chavez spoke through a barely concealed chuckle. &#x201c; &#x2019;<i>Mano</i>, a white guy like you would stand out in there.&#x201d;</p><p>Ding had a master&#x2019;s degree in international relations, but he could turn on his East L.A. accent at the drop of a hat.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold up,&#x201d; Clark said. As the boss, his radio was primary and had the ability to override any chatter&#x2014;which he frequently did. &#x201c;Two Asian males coming out the main entrance now.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack threw his own monocular scope to his eye and got a good look at the two men. In their early twenties, with short cropped hair, both wore faded jeans. Loose white wife-beater shirts displayed arms and shoulders covered with tattoos. They loitered by the doors, each lighting up a cigarette. Ryan could make out the print of a pistol stuffed down the front of one guy&#x2019;s jeans, barely hidden under his shirt. The team had already identified several members of the Sun Yee On triad. Casita Roja was a strip club run by Tres Equis, a small cell of the Sinaloa Cartel known for the three figurative X&#x2019;s formed by a single bullet hole between the two dead eyes of their victims. Since the capture of Joaqu�n &#x201c;El Chapo&#x201d; Guzm�n, factions of the cartel were becoming even more bloody&#x2014;if more violence than that brought on by the Sinaloa was even possible.</p><p>It made sense that everyone in the club would be packing. The men out front spoke in rapid Mandarin&#x2014;which to Ryan made them sound highly pissed about something.</p><p>Midas cocked his head to one side, listening. The Chinese men took a couple cursory looks up and down the street, saw nothing to alarm them, and settled in to smoke and joke. They finished their cigarettes, stood outside, and then talked for two more minutes before going back inside, as if on a time clock.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing those two are triad,&#x201d; Ryan said.</p><p>Midas gave a slow nod. &#x201c;Sounds like these Sun Yee On assholes are into some heavy shit with Tres Equis. �Prostitution, drugs, you name it. According to these guys, they&#x2019;re supplying the Mexicans precursor chemicals to cook up some meth. My Mandarin&#x2019;s a little rusty, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure I heard &#x2018;red phosphorus&#x2019; in there.&#x201d;</p><p>Clark concurred. &#x201c;Thought I caught that.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t fluent in Mandarin, but he&#x2019;d been around long enough to pick up more than a few words and suss out the interspersed English. &#x201c;Any mention of Eddie Feng?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Midas said.</p><p>Their target, Eddie Feng, was a Taiwanese national. Apart from being addicted to strip clubs and lap dancers, he called himself a reporter for a rag called&nbsp;<i>Zhenhua Ribao&#x2014;True Word Daily</i>. This online journal specialized in juicy expos�s about the secret lives of the political elite in the People&#x2019;s Republic of China. The&nbsp;<i>ZRB</i>&nbsp;was, at best, sensationalized click-bait. At worst, it was just plain fake news.</p><p>Gerry Hendley, CEO of Hendley Associates, the financial arbitrage firm and white-side face of The Campus&#x2019;s clandestine activity, would never have approved the unwarranted surveillance of a bona fide journalist. But Eddie Feng was more of an entertainer and propagandist. Feng did, however, appear to have stumbled on something going on with Taiwanese operatives and the PRC.</p><p>Jack had found the tenuous connection while comparing some chatter on an Internet forum for the Confucius Institute at the University of Maryland. According to several U of M students,&nbsp;<i>True Word Daily</i>&nbsp;had run an article about the bombing of an unfinished subway tunnel on the outskirts of Beijing. There was a lot of detail in the article&#x2014;at least the translation Jack read&#x2014;details only someone familiar with the investigation or the person or group who did the bombing would know. Ryan happened to be privy to the same information in the form of a People&#x2019;s Armed Police transmission grab by Fort Meade. This Feng guy was getting too much right about events that would be embarrassing to the Chi�Coms to be blowing smoke. The PRC hadn&#x2019;t released anything about the subway bombing to the media yet. There was no chatter of it anywhere but for the NSA intercept&#x2014;and Eddie Feng&#x2019;s article.</p><p>Jack had taken his analysis to John Clark, who&#x2019;d done some research of his own before calling Ryan into a meeting with Gerry&#x2014;who&#x2019;d okayed a more intrusive operation. Gavin Biery, IT director for Hendley Associates, would pull up Eddie Feng&#x2019;s bank records, phone history, and anything else he could hack into&#x2014;which was, according to Biery, &#x201c;every digital jot and tittle&#x201d; there was on the man.</p><p>It turned out Eddie Feng had made a recent payment of two thousand dollars to a guy named Fernando Perez Gomez, a car dealer in South Dallas who the Texas Department of Public Safety Gang Intelligence database said had ties to the Tres Equis offshoot of Sinaloa&#x2014;and a second two thousand dollars to a Sun Yee On triad boss, a recent arrival to Plano, Texas, from Taiwan.</p><p>The information was thin, but considering the underworld players involved, and the fact that Eddie Feng had somehow gotten his hands on the information about the Beijing subway bombing, Clark and Hendley had agreed to spool up a short operation and use Eddie Feng as an &#x201c;unwitting agent.&#x201d; Feng would do the hard work, continuing to develop his sources and extracting information from them while they watched from afar and took notes. The Campus team would merely follow him during his investigation, see where he went, and who he met, and learn if he came up with any more useful intel from behind the Bamboo Curtain.</p><p>Biery had located Feng when his phone pinged a cell tower in Houston, but by the time the team had spun up and the Hendley Associates Gulfstream was in the air from Washington Reagan, Feng had already moved north. It didn&#x2019;t take him long, though, to get down to business in the Fort Worth&#x2013;�Dallas metroplex. In the past seven hours, the team had followed him to four different strip clubs. None of them were particularly high-class joints, but Casita Roja was definitely the worst. What&#x2019;s more, the club was located in an area of town where a couple bearded white guys like Jack Junior and Midas Jankowski stood out like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, like bearded white guys in the barrio.</p><p>Ryan looked at the front door of the club, then back to Midas. &#x201c;They say anything else useful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; Midas said. &#x201c;Other than the meth ingredients, they mostly talked about girls and shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Adara Sherman, another member of The Campus&#x2019;s operational cadre who was conversant in Mandarin, came over the net. &#x201c;One of them has a girlfriend who dances in this hellhole,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>John Clark spoke next. &#x201c;Did the skinny one mention something about a Camaro?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He did,&#x201d; Adara said, obviously impressed.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Ryan said. &#x201c;Am I the only one who&#x2019;s not fluent in a bunch of other languages besides English?&#x201d;</p><p>Ding Chavez, John Clark, Adara Sherman, and Dominic Caruso all answered back in turn.</p><p><i>&#x201c;S�.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Da.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Oui.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Hai.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Midas turned and looked at Ryan from the passenger seat, giving a little shrug in the darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like I need Rosetta Stone or a multilingual girlfriend,&#x201d; Jack muttered, reaching over the seat to grab the Gatorade bottle. He started to pop off and say something else, but he caught movement out the rear glass as he turned.</p><p>He froze.</p><p>&#x201c;John,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You got a visual on our six? I&#x2019;ve got movement out our back window.&#x201d;</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s slightly muffled voice came back a moment later, giving a play-by-play. Ryan could visualize the man&#x2019;s cheek welded to the comb of his suppressed&nbsp;.308 Winchester model 70, his eye peering through the reticle of a night-�vision scope.</p><p>&#x201c;Two Hispanic males,&#x201d; Clark said. &#x201c;One female. Males have pistols tucked in their pants&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One is carrying a cane or stick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Scratch that. It&#x2019;s a golf club&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The males just left the girl standing at the wall. They&#x2019;re creeping your way, Jack, ten meters and closing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re moving in from the west,&#x201d; Chavez said. He was in the crew-cab pickup with Adara, a little more than a block away.</p><p>Dom was parked farther out, five blocks up the street in the direction of the next nearest strip club with Hispanic or Asian ties. The location was another educated guess, since Eddie Feng had been working, more or less, along a zigzagging line of such places all day.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay sharp,&#x201d; Clark hissed. &#x201c;These guys are moving slow, tactical&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Always a chance they could be undercover cops&#x2014;hang on, the female decided she&#x2019;s coming with them now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; From the tone of his voice it was clear he remained on his rifle.</p><p>Clark exhaled fast, like a boxer taking a body blow.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit! Not cops. Guy with the golf club just whipped the shit out of the girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2019;Bout time to unass the car, partner,&#x201d; Midas said, drawing his sidearm.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold up,&#x201d; Jack said, his hand on the ignition. &#x201c;I got an idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming up on either side,&#x201d; Clark said.</p><p>He could see the man on his side moving up now, almost at the back of the Taurus.</p></p><h2>Through the Language Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages</h2><p><p><b>A masterpiece of linguistics scholarship, at once erudite and entertaining, confronts the thorny question of how&#x2015;and whether&#x2015;culture shapes language and language, culture</b></p><p>Linguistics has long shied away from claiming any link between a language and the culture of its speakers: too much simplistic (even bigoted) chatter about the romance of Italian and the goose-stepping orderliness of German has made serious thinkers wary of the entire subject. But now, acclaimed linguist Guy Deutscher has dared to reopen the issue. Can culture influence language&#x2015;and vice versa? Can different languages lead their speakers to different thoughts? Could our experience of the world depend on whether our language has a word for "blue"? </p><p>Challenging the consensus that the fundaments of language are hard-wired in our genes and thus universal, Deutscher argues that the answer to all these questions is&#x2015;yes. In thrilling fashion, he takes us from Homer to Darwin, from Yale to the Amazon, from how to name the rainbow to why Russian water&#x2015;a "she"&#x2015;becomes a "he" once you dip a tea bag into her, demonstrating that language does in fact reflect culture in ways that are anything but trivial. Audacious, delightful, and field-changing, <i>Through the Language Glass</i> is a classic of intellectual discovery.</p></p><p><p><b>Guy Deutscher</b> is the author of <i>The Unfolding of Language</i>. Formerly a fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, and of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Languages at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, he is an honorary research fellow at the School of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures at the University of Manchester. He lives in Oxford, England.</p><p>PROLOGUE </p><p>Language, Culture, and Thought </p><p>"There are four tongues worthy of the world's use," says the Talmud: "Greek for song, Latin for war, Syriac for lamentation, and Hebrew for ordinary speech." Other authorities have been no less decided in their judgment on what different languages are good for. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, king of Spain, archduke of Austria, and master of several Europe an tongues, professed to speaking "Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse." </p><p>A nation's language, so we are often told, reflects its culture, psyche, and modes of thought. Peoples in tropical climes are so laid-back it's no wonder they let most of their consonants fall by the wayside. And one need only compare the mellow sounds of Portuguese with the harshness of Spanish to understand the quintessential difference between these two neighboring cultures. The grammar of some languages is simply not logical enough to express complex ideas. German, on the other hand, is an ideal vehicle for formulating the most precise philosophical profundities, as it is a particularly orderly language, which is why the Germans have such orderly minds. (But can one not hear the goose step in its gauche, humorless sounds?) Some languages don't even have a future tense, so their speakers naturally have no grasp of the future. The Babylonians would have been hard-pressed to understand <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, because their language used one and the same word to describe both of these concepts. The craggy fjords are audible in the precipitous intonation of Norwegian, and you can hear the dark <i>l</i>'s of Russian in Tchaikovsky's lugubrious tunes. French is not only a Romance language but the language of romance par excellence. English is an adaptable, even promiscuous language, and Italian&#x2014;ah, Italian! </p><p>Many a dinner table conversation is embellished by such vignettes, for few subjects lend themselves more readily to disquisition than the character of different languages and their speakers. And yet should these lofty observations be carried away from the conviviality of the dining room to the chill of the study, they would quickly collapse like a souffl� of airy anecdote&#x2014; at best amusing and meaningless, at worst bigoted and absurd. Most foreigners cannot hear the difference between rugged Norwegian and the endless plains of Swedish. The industrious Protestant Danes have dropped more consonants onto their icy windswept soil than any indolent tropical tribe. And if Germans do have systematic minds, this is just as likely to be because their exceedingly erratic mother tongue has exhausted their brains' capacity to cope with any further irregularity. English speakers can hold lengthy conversations about forthcoming events wholly in the present tense (I'm flying to Vancouver next week . . . ) without any detectable loosening in their grip on the concepts of futurity. No language&#x2014;not even that of the most "primitive" tribes&#x2014;is inherently unsuitable for expressing the most complex ideas. Any shortcomings in a language's ability to philosophize simply boil down to the lack of some specialized abstract vocabulary and perhaps a few syntactic constructions, but these can easily be borrowed, just as all Europe an languages pinched their verbal philosophical tool kit from Latin, which in turn lifted it wholesale from Greek. If speakers of any tribal tongue were so minded, they could easily do the same today, and it would be eminently possible to deliberate in Zulu about the respective merits of empiricism and rationalism or to hold forth about existentialist phenomenology in West Greenlandic. </p><p>If musings on nations and languages were merely aired over aperitifs, they could be indulged as harmless, if nonsensical, diversions. But as it happens, the subject has also exercised high and learned minds throughout the ages. Philosophers of all persuasions and nationalities have lined up to proclaim that each language reflects the qualities of the nation that speaks it. In the seventeenth century, the Englishman Francis Bacon explained that one can infer "significant marks of the genius and manners of people and nations from their languages." "Everything confirms," agreed the Frenchman �tienne de Condillac a century later, "that each language expresses the character of the people who speak it." His younger contemporary, the German Johann Gottfried Herder, concurred that "the intellect and the character of every nation are stamped in its language." Industrious nations, he said, "have an abundance of moods in their verbs, while more refined nations have a large amount of nouns that have been exalted to abstract notions." In short, "the genius of a nation is nowhere better revealed than in the physiognomy of its speech." The American Ralph Waldo Emerson summed it all up in 1844: "We infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which is a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone." </p><p>The only problem with this impressive international unanimity is that it breaks down as soon as thinkers move on from the general principles to reflect on the particular qualities (or otherwise) of particular languages, and about what these linguistic qualities can tell about the qualities (or otherwise) of particular nations. In 1889, Emerson's words were assigned as an essay topic to the seventeen-year-old Bertrand Russell, when he was at a crammer in London preparing for the scholarship entrance exam to Trinity College, Cambridge. Russell responded with these pearls: "We may study the character of a people by the ideas which its language best expresses. French, for instance, contains such words as 'spirituel,' or 'l'esprit,' which in English can scarcely be expressed at all; whence we naturally draw the inference, which may be confirmed by actual observation, that the French have more 'esprit,' and are more 'spirituel' than the English." </p><p>Cicero, on the other hand, drew exactly the opposite inference from the lack of a word in a language. In his <i>De oratore</i> of 55 bc, he embarked on a lengthy sermon about the lack of a Greek equivalent for the Latin word <i>ineptus</i> (meaning "impertinent" or "tactless"). Russell would have concluded that the Greeks had such impeccable manners that they simply did not need a word to describe a nonexistent flaw. Not so Cicero: for him, the absence of the word was a proof that the fault was so widespread among the Greeks that they didn't even notice it. </p><p>The language of the Romans was itself not always immune to censure. Some twelve centuries after Cicero, Dante Alighieri surveyed the dialects of Italy in his <i>De vulgari eloquentia</i> and declared that "what the&nbsp;Romans speak is not so much a vernacular as a vile jargon . . . and this should come as no surprise, for they also stand out among all Italians for the ugliness of their manners and their outward appearance." </p><p>No one would dream of entertaining such sentiments about the French language, which is not only romantic and <i>spirituel</i> but also, of course, the paragon of logic and clarity. We have this on no lesser authority than the French themselves. In 1894, the distinguished critic Ferdinand Bruneti�re informed the members of the Acad�mie fran�aise, on the occasion of his election to this illustrious institution, that French was "the most logical, the clearest, and the most transparent language that has ever been spoken by man." Bruneti�re, in turn, had this on the authority of a long line of savants, including Voltaire in the eighteenth century, who affirmed that the unique genius of the French language was its clearness and order. And Voltaire himself owed this insight to an astonishing discovery made a whole century earlier, in 1669, to be precise. The French grammarians of the seventeenth century had spent decades trying to understand why it was that French possessed clarity beyond all other languages in the world and why, as one member of the Acad�mie put it, French was endowed with such clarity and precision that simply translating into it had the effect of a real commentary. In the end, after years of travail, it was Louis Le Laboureur who discovered in 1669 that the answer was simplicity itself. His painstaking grammatical researches revealed that, in contrast to speakers of other languages, "we French follow in all our utterances exactly the order of thought, which is the order of Nature." No wonder, then, that French can never be obscure. As the later thinker Antoine de Rivarol put it: "What is not clear may be English, Italian, Greek, or Latin" but "ce qui n'est pas clair n'est pas fran�ais." </p><p>Not all intellectuals of the world unite, however, in concurring with this analysis. Equally distinguished thinkers&#x2014; strangely enough, mostly from outside France&#x2014;have expressed different opinions. The renowned Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, for example, believed that English was superior to French in a whole range of attributes, including logic, for as opposed to French, English is a "methodical, energetic, business-like and sober language, that does not care much for finery and elegance, but does care for logical consistency." Jespersen concludes: "As the language is, so also is the nation." </p></p><h2>Twilight Collector&#39;s Edition (The Twilight Saga, 1)</h2><p>When Isabella Swan moves to the gloomy town of Forks and meets the mysterious, alluring Edward Cullen, her life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn.

At the end of our lives we &#x201c;cross over&#x201d; into a new phase of the same soul journey we are on right this minute.<br><br>In <i>Life After Death</i>, Chopra draws on cutting-edge scientific discoveries and the great wisdom traditions to provide a map of the afterlife. It&#x2019;s a fascinating journey into many levels of consciousness. But far more important is his urgent message: Who you meet in the afterlife and what you experience there reflect your present beliefs, expectations, and level of awareness. In the here and now you can shape what happens after you die.<br><br>By bringing the afterlife into the present moment, <i>Life After Death</i> opens up an immense new area of creativity. Ultimately there is no division between life and death&#x2014;there is only one continuous creative project. Chopra invites us to become cocreators in this subtle realm, and as we come to understand the one reality, we shed our irrational fears and step into a numinous sense of wonder and personal power.</p><p>Deepak Chopra is the founder of the Chopra Center for Well Being (chopra.com) and president of the Alliance for a New Humanity (anhglobal.org.).Memoir: The Life Beyond<br><br>While writing this book on the afterlife, I kept being drawn back to stories that I'd heard in India as a child. Parables are a powerful way to teach children, and many of the ones told to me have lasted all my life. So I decided to weave the book around tales of the kind I heard at home, around the temples, and at school, hoping that the reader would be enticed by a world where heroes battle darkness in order to emerge into the light.<br><br>In this case the hero is a woman, Savitri, and the enemy she must defeat is Yama, the lord of death. Yama shows up in her front yard one day, waiting to take away her husband the moment he returns from his work as a woodcutter. Savitri is terrified. What strategy could possibly turn Death away from his inexorable mission?<br><br>I had no trouble imagining these characters. I was frightened for Savitri and anxious to find out how her battle of wits with Death turned out. Their world flowed easily into my own, because the India of my childhood was not that far removed from ancient India. I want to take a moment to convey what death and the world beyond meant back then. It may seem like a very esoteric place. If so, you can come back to it after reading the main body of the book. However mysterious and exotic, here is where I began.<br><br>What was most magical in my childhood was transformation. Death itself was seen as a brief stopping point on an endless soul journey that could turn a peasant into a king and vice versa. With the possibility of infinite lifetimes extending forward and backward, a soul could experience hundreds of heavens and hells. Death ended nothing; it opened up limitless adventures. But at a deeper level, it's typically Indian not to crave permanence. A drop of water becomes vapor, which is invisible, yet vapor materializes into billowing clouds, and from clouds rain falls back to earth, forming river torrents and eventually merging into the sea. Has the drop of water died along the way? No, it undergoes a new expression at each stage. Likewise, the idea that I have a fixed body locked in space and time is a mirage. Any drop of water inside my body could have been ocean, cloud, river, or spring the day before. I remind myself of this fact when the bonds of daily life squeeze too tight.<br><br>In the West the hereafter has been viewed as a place akin to the material world. Heaven, hell, and purgatory lie in some distant region beyond the sky or under the earth. In the India of my childhood the hereafter wasn't a place at all, but a state of awareness.<br><br>The cosmos that you and I are experiencing right now, with trees, plants, people, houses, cars, stars, and galaxies, is just consciousness expressing itself at one particular frequency. Elsewhere in spacetime, different planes exist simultaneously. If I had asked my grandmother where heaven was, she would have pointed to the house we lived in, not only because it was full of love, but because it made sense to her that many worlds could comfortably inhabit the same place. By analogy, if you are listening to a concert orchestra, there are a hundred instruments playing, each occupying the same place in space and time. You can listen to the symphony as a whole or, if you wish, put your attention on a specific instrument. You can even separate out the individual notes played by that instrument. The presence of one frequency does not displace any of the others.<br><br>I didn't know it as a child, but when I walked around the crowded Delhi market where more humanity was packed into one bazaar than was possible to imagine, the world I couldn't see was even more crowded. The air that I breathed contained voices, car noises, bird songs, radio waves, X-rays, cosmic rays, and an almost infinite array of subatomic particles. Endless realities lay all around me.<br><br>Every frequency in nature exists simultaneously, and yet we experience only what we see. It's natural to fear what we can't see, and since death snatches a person out of sight, we react to it with fear. I certainly wasn't immune to this. The death of a pet made me anxious and sad; the death of my grandfather, which happened suddenly in the middle of the night, was devastating. My younger brother kept running around the house crying, "Where is he? Where is he?" It would be years before I realized that the correct answer was "Here and everywhere."<br><br>Different planes of existence represent different frequencies of consciousness. The world of physical matter is just one expression of a particular frequency. (Decades later, I was fascinated to read that according to physicists, there is a background hum to the universe that is so specific as to sound like the note B-flat, although it vibrates millions of times lower than human hearing.) In India a child would never hear such a complicated quasi-scientific idea, but we did hear about the five elements, or Mahabhutas: earth, water, fire, air, and space. These elements combined to form everything in existence, which sounds crude to someone versed in Western science, but it contained a valuable truth: All transformations come down to a few simple elements.<br><br>In the twentieth century Western science came to understand that all solid objects are actually made of invisible vibrations. In my childhood, solid things were seen to have a large portion of the earth element. To put it another way, solid things had dense vibrations, or vibrations on a lower plane. Vaporous things had a fine vibration, on a higher plane.<br><br>Just as there are different planes of material things, there are also different spiritual planes, a shocking notion to the pious Catholic brothers, mostly Irish, who were my teachers at school. To them the only spirit was the Holy Ghost that lived in heaven. We children were politic enough not to disagree, yet in our cosmos it only made sense that if the Earth was a dense spiritual world, there must be higher spiritual planes, known to us as Lokas, which in Western mystical circles became known as "astral planes." There are an almost infinite number of astral planes, divided into a higher and lower astral world, and even the lowest ones vibrate at a higher frequency than the material world.<br><br>Long ago the West gave up trying to hear the music of the spheres, but in India it is believed that a person with finely tuned consciousness can go inward and actually hear the vibration of various higher planes. In the astral plane you can see your own body, for instance, yet it might change in age from moment to moment.<br><br>In the lower astral planes we find clairvoyance, telepathy, and other refinements of the five senses, as well as ghosts, disembodied souls, and spirits that for one reason or another are "stuck." As a child I was certain that when a cat or dog paused to assess the air, it saw something I couldn't. So it came as no surprise to later read, in various texts both Eastern and Western, that lower astral planes sometimes sensed by humans in higher states of awareness are often sensed by animals. Nor was I surprised to meet a psychiatry resident who told me that if the hospital room was dimly lit enough, he could see--on the very edge of visibility--when the soul left a dying person. Every Indian child devours comic books about the exploits of various heroes who fought their battles in faraway Lokas. Slipping in and out of material existence was our version of traveling to outer space. Our comic book heroes would come across thought forms and thought clouds, astral bodies traveling during sleep, astral colors and auras. All these are vibrations in the lower astral plane.<br><br>In the Indian tradition every physical body is assigned an accompanying astral body. Your astral body is a complete mirror of your physical body; it has a heart, liver, arms, legs, a face, etc., but since it operates at a higher frequency, most people are unaware of it. During life, the physical body provides a garment for the soul; it gives it the appearance of being localized in the material world. In death, as the physical body begins to disintegrate, the departing soul enters an astral plane that corresponds to its existence on the material plane, the frequency that corresponds most closely to its former life.<br><br>The general notion that you go where you belong rested easily in my mind back then. I imagined dogs going to dog heaven, and people who loved dogs joining them. I imagined bad people no longer hurting anyone except themselves because they were isolated in a kind of karmic jail. This was consoling, an assurance that the good people who loved me but were now gone lived in a place of goodness. But my view had limitations. I was never sure whether my wise grandfather met his wise grandfather in the hereafter, who showed him how to proceed, or if that job was carried out by angels, or enlightened spirits. Much later when I began to research karma I found that after we die, we remain self-motivated. A soul moves according to its desire from one astral plane to another, projecting as in a dream whatever sights and people, guides and astral entities it needs for its own advancement.<br><br>All these planes ultimately were imagined by Spirit, just as it imagined the material world. The Indian word for Spirit was Brahman, which is Everything, the one consciousness that fills every plane of existence. But Indians are relaxed about terminology, as befits a very old culture. We said God. Rama. Shiva. Maheshwara. The important thing wasn't the name but the concept of a single consciousness that creates everything and continues to do so in infinite dimensions at infinite speed. On the astral planes Spirit continues to play roles. There, one can actually see images of gods and goddesses, angels and demons. These are ultimately illusions, however, for each astral plane provides the experience of Spirit. Here, on our plane, we experience Spirit as matter, solidity. On the astral planes we experience subtle beings and the landscapes they inhabit--what we might call dreams.<br><br>The cosmos is nonlocal, that is, it can't be mapped as a location. After death we gradually stop being local. We see ourselves as we really are from the soul's perspective: everywhere at once. This adjustment is probably the biggest obstacle any of us will encounter in the astral planes. Right now you are at the center of the universe because infinity extends in all directions, yet someone on the other side of the world is also at the center of the universe, because infinity extends on all sides of them, too. If both of you are centers of the universe, you must both be at the same location. The fact that you appear to be in different places is a sensory artifact. It's based on sights and sounds, which are local events. You are not a local event.<br><br>Similarly, each moment is the center of time, because eternity stretches around each moment in all directions. Therefore every moment is the same as every other. The cosmos, being nonlocal, has no up or down, north or south, east or west. These are only points of reference for our convenience at our particular frequency (i.e., inside a body). The transformational process after death is not a movement to some other place or time; it is just a change in the quality of our attention. You can only see what you vibrate to.<br><br>I had an uncle who loved to travel and visit the various saints and sages that so densely populate India. Sometimes, to my fascination, he brought me along. I saw renunciates who sat in one posture for years at a time; others who barely breathed. I know now that my eyes were deceiving me. I only saw a chrysalis, inside of which marvelous transformations were taking place. Silently, these figures were tuning in to different frequencies beyond the outside world. Through a shift in attention they could speak to Rama (or Buddha or Christ, though that was less likely in India). Deep meditation wasn't an inert state; it was a launching pad for consciousness. In the ER when someone dies of a heart attack, only to be resuscitated with reports of a near-death experience, he or she uses a different launching pad. In both cases there was a shift in the quality of attention.<br><br>The big difference is that when a cardiac patient goes into the light, the journey is involuntary. Those silent yogis from my past were exercising an intention. By having a desire at a deep enough level of awareness, they went through a process that parallels death. The senses fade one by one. (The last one to leave when a person dies is sound, which was the first to come in at birth. This fits the Indian notion that the five elements come and go in a specific order; since sound is the equivalent of vibration, which holds the body together, it makes sense that it would be the last to go.)<br><br>As the gross senses become duller, the subtle senses sharpen. We still see and hear after we die, but now the objects aren't physical. They consist of anything we want to see on the astral plane: celestial sights and sounds, heavenly beings, and brilliant lights. In near-death experiences the most typical manifestations are faces, voices, or an emotional presence. In other traditional cultures people might expect to encounter ghosts or animals. Often a dying person feels something subtle around him--a certain warmth, a faint form or sound before leaving the body. Somehow these can be accessed on the dying person's vibrational frequency. Anyone who has spent time with the dying knows that they may say that they've been joined in the room by a departed spouse or other long-dead loved one. Some kind of astral contact is being made in the transition zone from physical to subtle.<br><br>At death the astral counterpart of the physical body separates from it. According to Vedic teachings, the departed soul then sleeps for a time in the astral region, which I translate as its incubation period. New ideas percolate in the mind before they lead to action, and something similar happens with the soul. Normally the soul sleeps peacefully, but if a person dies suddenly or prematurely, or has many unfulfilled desires, this sleep may be restless and disturbed. The horrors of a violent death would continue to reverberate, and so would more mundane torments like unrequited love or grief. Suicides experience the same inner pain that led them to take their lives.<br><br>Unfulfilled desires don't have to be negative. A longing for pleasure also represents an inability to let go. My uncle the spiritual devotee heard many detailed accounts of souls stuck in lower astral planes. Days, months, and years aren't the yardsticks of the soul's perspective.</p><h2>John Von Neumann</h2><p>A biography of the man regarded as the greatest scientist since Einstein moves from the laboratory to the highest levels of government, showing how von Neumann&#39;s theories provided the building blocks for the modern computer, the atom bomb, radar, artificial intelligence, and more.</p><p>Macrae, former editor of the Economist and author of The 2025 Report (1985), offers an oddly jocular biography of the Hungarian mathematical prodigy who would become a highly influential cold warrior before his death in 1957--an account whose credibility is hindered by the author's unabashed reverence for his subject. One of the four Hungarian geniuses who would help introduce the Atomic Age at Los Alamos (the others were Edward Teller, Leo Szilard, and Eugene Wigner), von Neumann made his mark in Europe while barely past his teens through his contributions to a mathematical foundation for the new quantum physics. In 1930, the young, newly married mathematician emigrated to America to teach at Princeton. While von Neumann moved on in succeeding years to increasingly influential posts at the Institute for Advanced Study, the Los Alamos atom-bomb project, Teller's hydrogen-bomb program, and, finally, the freshly created Atomic Energy Commission, his agile and highly logical mind left an indelible mark on the computer revolution, games theory, economics, and, as his political clout increased, international relations. Despite the fact that the general reader is as likely to be interested in the development of von Neumann's hawkish political stance (particularly regarding the nuclear-arms race), and his odd fascination with such topics as global government and control of the weather, as in his scientific contributions, Macrae veers away from serious exploration of his subject's philosophical outlook--instead emphasizing (and applauding) the ease with which ``our Johnny'' used dirty jokes to evade emotional political debate, and ridiculing those of differing political temperament (e.g., deeming ``Bertie'' Russell and Norbert Wiener ``geniuses turned emotionally too dotty''). The effect is off-putting, and though ``Johnny's'' romp through world affairs is dutifully recounted, the private motivations of this hard-drinking, power-loving genius remain, in quintessential 50's style, drowned in nervous laughter. (B&amp;w photos--16 pages--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Von Neumann (1903-1957), the mathematical prodigy who exercised deadly cool logic in developing the Los Alamos atom bomb and in placing Hiroshima on America's list of target cities, was an excessively polite, self-critical, shy genius. Born to a cultured Jewish family in Budapest, this bright light of Weimar Germany and of Depression-era Princeton is usually remembered as a warmonger and a right-wing hawk. But in this affectionate, humanizing biography, former Economist editor Macrae limns a prescient pragmatist who actively fought against fascism and who advocated a policy of nuclear deterrence because he foresaw that Stalin's Soviet Union would rapidly acquire the bomb and develop rocketry. A prime architect of the modern digital computer, von Neumann brought about a revolution in meteorology and left his mark on physics, game theory and economics. Macrae makes these contributions accessible to the lay reader, and also discusses von Neumann's relationships with two long-suffering wives, his political differences with Einstein and the cancer that killed him. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Professor Wormbog in Search for the Zipperump-a-Zoo (Classic Collectible Series)</h2><p>Professor Wormbog has collected a Kerploppus, an Ickky, a Murgatroy, and a Useless.

Flashbacks about 355 and Ampersand mortar the three plot streams together, and moody, crepuscular coloring by Zylonol makes the seventh volume of <i>Y</i> one of the handsomest as well as one of the most engaging. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She taught high school English for three years in San Antonio before leaving education to pursue a career as a novelist. Deanna makes her home in Virginia, where she lives with her husband and daughter and is hard at work on her next novel.<br><br>Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a strange and dangerous country.<br><br><em>&#x2014;The Hero </em>Rabindranath Tagore<br><br><em>Somewhere in the foothills of the Himalayas, 1889</em><br><br>"I thought there would be camels," I protested. "I thought there would be pink marble palaces and dusty deserts and strings of camels to ride. Instead there is this." I waved a hand toward the motley collection of bullocks, donkeys, and one rather bored-looking elephant that had carried us from Darjeeling town. I did not look at the river. We were meant to cross it, but one glance had decided me firmly against it.<br><br>"I told you it was the Himalayas. It is not my fault the nearest desert is almost a thousand miles away. Do not blame me for your feeble grasp of geography," my elder sister, Portia, said by way of reproof. She gave a theatrical sigh. "For heaven's sake, Julia, don't be difficult. Climb onto the floating buffalo and let's be off. We are meant to cross this river before nightfall." Portia folded her arms across her chest and stared at me repressively I stood my ground. "Portia, a floating buffalo is hardly a proper mode of transport. Now, I grant you, I did not expect Indian transportation to run to plush carriages and steam trains, but you must own this is a bit primitive by any standards," I said, pointing with the tip of my parasol to the water's edge where several rather nasty-looking rafts had been fashioned by means of lashing inflated buffalo hides to odd bits of lumber. The hides looked hideously lifelike, as if the buffalo had merely rolled onto their backs for a bit of slumber, but bloated, and as the wind changed I noticed they gave off a very distinctive and unpleasant smell.<br><br>Portia blanched a little at the odour, but stiffened her resolve. "Julia, we are Englishwomen. We are not cowed by a little authentic local flavour."<br><br>I felt my temper rising, the result of too much travel and too much time spent in proximity to my family. "I have just spent the better part of a year exploring the most remote corners of the Mediterranean during my honeymoon. It is not the 'local flavour' that concerns me. It is the possibility of death by drowning," I added, nodding toward the ominous little ripples in the grey-green surface of the broad river.<br><br>Our brother Plum, who had been watching the exchange with interest, spoke up with uncharacteristic firmness. "We are crossing the river and we shall do it now, even if I have to put the pair of you on my shoulders and walk across it." His temper had risen faster than my own, but I could not entirely blame him. He had been ordered by our father, the Earl March, to accompany his sisters to India, and the experience had proven less than pleasant thus far.<br><br>Portia's mouth curved into a smile. "Have you added walking on water to your talents, dearest?" she asked nastily. "I would have thought that beyond the scope of even your prodigious abilities."<br><br>Plum rose to the bait and they began to scrap like a pair of feral cats, much to the amusement of our porters who began to wager quietly upon the outcome.<br><br>"Enough!" I cried, stopping my ears with my hands. I had listened to their quarrels since they had run me to ground in Egypt, and I was heartily sick of them both. I summoned my courage and strode to the nearest raft, determined to set an example of English rectitude for my siblings. "Come on then," I ordered, a touch smugly. "It's the merest child's play."<br><br>I turned to look, pleased to see they had left off their silly bickering.<br><br>"Julia&#x2014;" Portia began.<br><br>I held up a hand. "No more. Not another word from either of you."<br><br>"But&#x2014;" Plum started.<br><br>I stared him down. "I am quite serious, Plum. You have been behaving like children, the pair of you, and I have had my fill of it. We are all of us above thirty years of age, and there is no call for us to quarrel like spoiled schoolmates. Now, let us get on with this journey like adults, shall we?"<br><br>And with that little speech, the raft sank beneath me and I slipped beneath the chilly waters of the river.<br><br>Within minutes the porters had fished me out and restored me to dry land where I was both piqued and relieved to find that my little peccadillo had caused my siblings so much mirth they were clasped in each other's arms, still wiping their eyes.<br><br>"I hope you still find it amusing when I die of some dread disease," I hissed at them, tipping the water from my hat. "Holy Mother Ganges might be a sacred river, but she is also a filthy one and I have seen enough dead bodies floating past to know it is no place for the living."<br><br>"True," Portia acknowledged, wiping at her eyes. "But this isn't the Ganges, dearest. It's the Hooghly."<br><br>Plum let out a snort. "The Hooghly is in Calcutta. This is the Rangeet," he corrected. "Apparently Julia is not the only one with a tenuous hold on geography."<br><br>Before they could fly at one another again, I gave a decided sneeze and a rather chaotic interlude followed during which the porters hastily built up a fire to ward off a chill and unpacked my trunks to provide me with dry clothing. I gave another hearty sneeze and said a fervent prayer that I had not contracted some virulent plague from my dousing in the river, whichever it might be.<br><br>But even as I feared for my health, I lamented the loss of my hat. It was a delicious confection of violet tulle spotted with silk butterflies&#x2014;entirely impractical even in the early spring sunshine of the foothills of the Himalayas, but wholly beautiful. "It was a present from Brisbane," I said mournfully as I turned the sodden bits over in my hands.<br><br>"I thought we were forbidden from speaking his name," Portia said, handing me a cup of tea. The porters brewed up quantities of rank, black tea in tremendous cans every time we stopped. After three days of the stuff, I had almost grown to like it.<br><br>I took a sip, pulling a face at my sister. "Of course not. It is the merest disagreement. As soon as he joins us from Calcutta, the entire matter will be resolved," I said, with a great deal more conviction than I felt.<br><br>The truth was my honeymoon had ended rather abruptly when my brother and sister arrived upon the doorstep of Shep-heard's Hotel the first week of February. The end of the archaeological season was drawing near, and Brisbane and I had thoroughly enjoyed several dinners with the various expeditions as they passed through Cairo to and from the excavations at Luxor. Brisbane had been to Egypt before, and our most recent foray into detection had left me with a fascination for the place. It had been the last stop on our extended tour of the Mediterranean and therefore had been touched with a sort of melancholy sweetness. We would be returning to England shortly and I knew we would never again share the sort of intimacy our wedding trip had provided. Brisbane's practice as a private enquiry agent and my extensive and demanding family would see to that.<br><br>But even as we were passing those last bittersweet days in Egypt, I was aware of a new restlessness in my husband, and&#x2014; if I were honest&#x2014;in myself. Eight months of travel with only each other, my maid, Morag, and occasional appearances from his valet, Monk, had left us craving diversion. We were neither of us willing to speak of it, but it hovered in the air between us. I saw his hands tighten upon the newspaper throughout the autumn as the killer known as Jack the Ripper terrorised the East End, coming perilously close to my beloved Aunt Hermia's refuge for reformed prostitutes. I suspected Brisbane would have liked to have turned his hand to the case, but he never said, and I did not ask. Instead we moved on to Turkey to explore the ruins of Troy, and eventually the Whitechapel murders ceased. Brisbane seemed content to make a study of the local fauna whilst I made feeble attempts at watercolours, but more than once I found him deftly unpicking a lock with the slender rods he still carried upon his person at all times. I knew he was keeping his hand in, and I knew also from the occasional murmurs in his sleep that he was not entirely happy with married life.<br><br>I did not personally displease him, he made that perfectly apparent through regular and enthusiastic demonstrations of his affections. Rather <em>too </em>enthusiastic, as the proprietor of a hotel in Cyprus had commented huffily. But Brisbane was a man of action, forced to live upon his wits from a tender age, and domesticity was a difficult coat for him to wear.<br><br>Truth be told, the fit of it chafed me a bit as well. I was not the sort of wife to darn shirts or bake pies, and, indeed, he had made it quite clear that was not the sort of wife he wanted. But we had been partners in detection in three cases, and without the fillip of danger I found myself growing fretful. As delightful as it had been to have my husband to myself for the better part of a year, and as glorious as it had been to travel extensively, I longed for adventure, for challenge, for the sort of exploits we had enjoyed so thoroughly together in the past.<br><br>And just when I had made up my mind to address the issue, my sister and brother had arrived, throwing Shepheard's into upheaval and demanding we accompany them to India.<br><br>To his credit, Brisbane did not even seem surprised to see them when they appeared in the dining room and settled themselves at our table without ceremony. I sighed and turned away from the view. A full moon hung over old Cairo, silvering the minarets that pierced the skyline and casting a gentle glow over the city. It was impossibly romantic&#x2014;or it had been until Portia and Plum arrived.<br><br>"I see you are working on the fish course. No chance of soup then?" Portia asked, helping herself to a bread roll.<br><br>I resisted the urge to stab her hand with my fork. I looked to Brisbane, imperturbable and impeccable in his evening clothes of starkest black, and quickly looked away. Even after almost a year of marriage, a feeling of shyness sometimes took me by surprise when I looked at him unawares&#x2014;a feyness, the Scots would call it, a sense that we had both of us tempted the fates with too much happiness together.<br><br>Brisbane summoned the waiter and ordered the full set menu for Portia and for Plum, who had thrown himself into a chair and adopted a scowl. I glanced about the dining room, not at all surprised to find our party had become the subject not just of surreptitious glances but of outright curiosity. We Marches tended to have that effect when we appeared <em>en masse. </em>No doubt some of the guests recognised us&#x2014;Marches have never been shy of publicity and our eccentricities were well catalogued by both the press and society-watchers&#x2014;but I suspected the rest were merely intrigued by my siblings' sartorial elegance. Portia, a beautiful woman with excellent carriage, always dressed <em>cap-a-pie </em>in a single hue, and had elected to arrive wearing a striking shade of orange, while Plum, whose ensemble is never complete without some touch of purest whimsy, was sporting a waistcoat embroidered with poppies and a cap of violet velvet. My own scarlet evening gown, which had seemed so daring and elegant a moment before, now felt positively demure.<br><br>"Why are you here?" I asked the pair of them bluntly. Brisbane had settled back in his chair with the same expression of studied amusement he often wore when confronted with my family. He and Portia enjoyed an excellent relationship built upon genuine, if cautious, affection, but none of my brothers had especially warmed to my husband. Plum in particular could be quite nasty when provoked.<br><br>Portia put aside the menu she had been studying and fixed me with a serious look. "We are bound for India, and I want you to come with us, both of you," she added, hastily collecting Brisbane with her glance.<br><br>"India! What on earth&#x2014;" I broke off. "It's Jane, isn't it?" Portia's former lover had abandoned her the previous spring after several years of comfortably settled domesticity. It had been a blow to Portia, not least because Jane had chosen to marry, explaining that she longed for children of her own and a more conventional life than the one they had led together in London. She had gone to India with her new husband, and we had heard nothing from her since. I had worried for Portia for months afterward. She had grown thinner, her lustrous complexion dimmed. Now she seemed almost brittle, her mannerisms darting and quick as a hummingbird's.<br><br>"It is Jane," she acknowledged. "I've had a letter. She is a widow."<br><br>I took a sip of wine, surprised to find it tasted sour upon my tongue. "Poor Jane! She must be grieved to have lost her husband so quickly after their marriage."<br><br>Portia said nothing for a moment, but bit at her lip. "She is in some sort of trouble," Brisbane said quietly.<br><br>Portia threw him a startled glance. "Not really, unless you consider impending motherhood to be trouble. She is expecting a child, and rather soon, as it happens. She has not had an easy time of it. She is lonely and she has asked me to come."<br><br>Brisbane's black eyes sharpened. "Is that all?"<br><br>The waiter interrupted, bringing soup for Portia and Plum and refilling wineglasses. We waited until he had bustled off to resume our discussion.<br><br>"There might be a bit of difficulty with his family," Portia replied, her jaw set. I knew that look well. It was the one she always wore when she tilted at windmills. Portia had a very old-fashioned and determined sense of justice. If she were a man, one would have called it chivalry.<br><br>"If the estate is entailed in the conventional manner, her expectations would upset the inheritance," Brisbane guessed. "If she produces a girl, the estate would go to her husband's nearest male relation, but if she bears a son, the child would inherit and until he is old enough to take control, Jane is queen of the castle."<br><br>"That is it precisely," Portia averred. Her face took on a mulish cast. "Bloody nonsense. A girl could manage that tea plantation as well as any boy. One only has to look at how well Julia and I have managed the estates we inherited from our husbands to see it."<br><br></p><h2>Huguenot Garden</h2><p>Huguenot Garden is a children's story of the daily and adventurous episodes in the lives of Rene and Albret Martineau, young twin sisters in a seventeeth-century, French Protestant family.

Zeno's dizzying 'proofs' that motion is impossible; the extraordinary atomic theories of Democritus; the haunting and enigmatic epigrams of Heraclitus; and the maxims of Alcmaeon: fragmentary as they often are, the thoughts of these philosophers seem strikingly modern in their concern to forge a truly scientific vocabulary and way of reasoning.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The phenomenally popular, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling satirist whom the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> calls, &#x201c;Stephen King with a whoopee cushion and a double-espresso imagination&#x201d; has already lampooned Shakespeare, San Francisco vampires, marine biologists, Death...even Jesus Christ and Santa Claus! Now, in his latest masterpiece, <em>Sacr� Bleu</em>, the immortal Moore takes on the Great French Masters. A magnificent &#x201c;Comedy d&#x2019;Art&#x201d; from the author of <em>Lamb</em>, <em>Fool</em>, and <em>Bite Me</em>, Moore&#x2019;s <em>Sacr� Bleu</em> is part mystery, part history (sort of), part love story, and wholly hilarious as it follows a young baker-painter as he joins the dapper&nbsp; Henri Toulouse-Lautrec on a quest to unravel the mystery behind the supposed &#x201c;suicide&#x201d; of Vincent van Gogh.<br></p></p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Christopher Moore on Writing <em>Sacre Bleu</em></strong> <br> <br> I suppose it started when I learned the circumstances of the suicide of Vincent van Gogh; how he had finished a painting, then walked into a corn field and shot himself, and not in the manner one thinks of a suicide. He shot himself in the abdomen, then walked over a mile on a rough trail through the woods above the village of Auvers, France, to the home of his friend, Doctor Gachet, for help. It seemed clear to me that this was not the behavior of a suicidal man. (Particularly when you see how well he was painting at the time.) Vincent had been murdered, and for some reason, I guess from looking at his paintings, I thought that the color blue might be a clue to the circumstances of his murder. <p>So I decided to write a novel about the color blue.</p> <p>When it first occurred to me, I had no idea what a can of paint of I was opening. I&#x2019;ve written historical novels before, but I&#x2019;d always picked periods and stories that had huge blank spots in them, spots that I could fill in with my story. But I was about to write about the period in which the French Impressionists rose to prominence, and unlike the life of Jesus or the court of King Lear, where very little was known about what actually happened, I could pretty much look up what each of the Impressionists had for breakfast every morning. It was a curse of riches. There was more material than I could ever cover in a single story, unless I found a way to constrain it.</p> <p>So, to pursue my murder mystery, my tale of an art movement, my portrayal of the Bell Epoch in Paris, I had to find a point of view that would help me cover the time period, from 1863 to 1891 and beyond, so I invented, Lucien Lessard, the baker of Montmartre, Paris&#x2014;the baker who wants to be a painter, whose father was a patron of Monet, Renoir, and Cezanne when they were at their poorest, and who attended art school with Vincent van Gogh and his best friend, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Lucien and Henri would be my detectives, and with them, we would discover not only Vincent&#x2019;s killer, but the secret and magic behind the mysterious shade of &#x201c;sacred blue&#x201d; (<em>Sacr� Bleu</em>), and how it had inspired and haunted artists all through history.</p> <p>Four years after the notion first occurred to me, I turned in the manuscript to <em>Sacr� Bleu</em>, and I think it is what I had hoped it could be: a mystery, a fantasy, a romance, a comedy, a history, and an appreciation. I didn&#x2019;t have an art education going into this book, but I certainly do coming out, and I hope that the reader will painlessly and joyfully, share some of the enthusiasm I have for the subject.</p> <p>Or, as it says in the prelude:</p> <p>&#x201c;Blue is glory and power, a wave, a particle, a vibration, a resonance, a spirit, a passion, a memory, a vanity, a metaphor, a dream.</p> <p>Blue is a simile.</p> <p>Blue, she is like a woman.&#x201d;</p><p>In July 1890, Vincent van Gogh went into a cornfield and shot himself. <em>Or did he?</em></p><p>Vincent&#x2019;s friends, baker-turned-painter Lucien Lessard and bon vivant Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, have their doubts. Now they&#x2019;re determined to answer the questions surrounding van Gogh&#x2019;s untimely death&#x2014;like who was the crooked little &#x201c;color man&#x201d; Vincent claimed was stalking him across France . . . and why had the painter recently become deathly afraid of a certain shade of blue?<em> Ooh la la</em>, <em>quelle surprise</em>, and <em>zut alors</em>, what follows is a surreal odyssey and brothel-crawl deep into the art world of late-nineteenth-century Paris, as the one, the only, Christopher Moore cooks up a delectable confection of intrigue, passion, and art history . . . with cancan girls, baguettes, and fine French cognac thrown in for good measure.</p></p><h2>Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1</h2><p>The first book of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.</p><p>ok of the definitive three-volume collection of short stories by the prolific Isaac Asimov, whose tales have delighted countless fans for over half a century--a must for every science fiction bookshelf.<b>Isaac Asimov</b>&nbsp;began his Foundation series at the age of 21, not realizing that it would one day be considered a cornerstone of science fiction.

Steve Wozniak, Apple Now available in paperback-with a new preface and interview with Jessica Livingston about Y Combinator! Founders at Work: Stories of Startups&#39; Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company. Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover? Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it&#39;s done. But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businessesdo create value more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.</p><p>Jessica Livingston is a founding partner at Y Combinator, a seed-stage venture firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Mountain View, California.

At eight, still too small to mount her horse unaided, she was galloping miles, alone, across Coorain, her parents' thirty thousand windswept, drought-haunted acres in the Australian outback, doing a "man's job" of helping herd the sheep because World War II had taken away the able-bodied men. She loved (and makes us see and feel) the vast unpeopled landscape, beautiful and hostile, whose uncertain weathers tormented the sheep ranchers with conflicting promises of riches and inescapable disaster. She adored (and makes us know) her large-visioned father and her strong, radiant mother, who had gone willingly with him into a pioneering life of loneliness and bone-breaking toil, who seemed miraculously to succeed in creating a warmly sheltering home in the harsh outback, and who, upon her husband's sudden death when Jill was ten, began to slide&#x2014;bereft of the partnership of work and love that had so utterly fulfilled her&#x2014;into depression and dependency.<br><br> We see Jill, staggered by the loss of her father, catapulted to what seemed another planet&#x2014;the suburban Sydney of the 1950s and its crowded, noisy, cliquish school life. Then the heady excitement of the University, but with it a yet more demanding course of lessons&#x2014;Jill embracing new ideas, new possibilities, while at the same time trying to be mother to her mother and resenting it, escaping into drink, pulling herself back, striking a balance. We see her slowly gaining strength, coming into her own emotionally and intellectually and beginning the joyous love affair that gave wings to her newfound self.<br><br> Worlds away from Coorain, in America, Jill Conway became a historian and the first woman president of Smith College. Her story of Coorain and the road from Coorain startles by its passion and evocative power, by its understanding of the ways in which a total, deep-rooted commitment to place&#x2014;or to a dream&#x2014;can at once liberate and imprison. It is a story of childhood as both Eden and anguish, and of growing up as a journey toward the difficult life of the free.</p><p>"Sheer delight." --Washington Post<br><br>"A small masterpiece of scene, memory and very stylish English.

Placing stories of individual women&#x2014;such as Sandra Bland, Rekia Boyd, Dajerria Becton, Monica Jones, and Mya Hall&#x2014;in the broader context of the twin epidemics of police violence and mass incarceration, it documents the evolution of movements centering women&#x2019;s experiences of policing and demands a radical rethinking of our visions of safety&#x2014;and the means we devote to achieving it.</p><p><b>Andrea J.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York, and Chicago.&#x201c;In clear, urgent prose, police-misconduct attorney Ritchie (<i>Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women</i>, 2015, etc.) shines an eye-opening spotlight on women of color targeted by police violence, a demographic that is not often well-represented in the media. She begins her discourse with history, discussing the controlling dynamic of slavery and colonization. The author then addresses more contemporary and vexing issues involving the aggressive enforcement of minor offenses and the rogue street policing of young women, disabled people, and gender-nonconforming people of color...She shares her impressions of the abuses of Native women protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline as well as...of Sandra Bland, Eleanor Bumpurs, and Kayla Moore, a black trans woman who died at the hands of transphobic police officers.

She challenges readers to organize and demand solutions that provide transparency and accountability. The systemic police exploitation of women and girls in marginalized communities will not cease without changes to the very structure of policing. Ritchie&#x2019;s focused study and call to action is an essential work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> hardly restricts itself to the past. Indeed, what makes the book so bracing isn&#x2019;t just the central thesis, which might feel already familiar in the era of Black Lives Matter. Rather, the book&#x2019;s central power lies in how it manages to highlight a full history of state violence aimed at women of color, and how indelibly that history informs present-day interactions with law enforcement.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Pacific Standard</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> deserves a standing ovation. It&#x2019;s a passionate, incisive critique of the many ways in which women and girls of color are systematically erased or marginalized in discussions of police violence. The stories told here will haunt, inspire, and challenge you to reimagine justice by moving the experience of Black women and girls from the margins to the center.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Michelle Alexander, author of <i>The New Jim Crow</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> is a necessary intervention in the literature on policing. Ritchie moved me from page one with layered, thoughtful, and well-researched storytelling describing the multiple ways women of color are impacted by criminalization, begging the question of how their stories have been neglected and calling on all of us to make them visible. The insights revealed by these experiences, if heeded, will undoubtedly transform the course of history.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Opal Tometi, cofounder of Black Lives Matter and executive director of Black Alliance for Just Immigration<br><br>&#x201c;With a profound sense of urgency and deep compassion, combining her keen instincts as a legal scholar and her work as an antiviolence activist, Andrea Ritchie brings long overdue attention to the policing of Black women and other women of color such that their stories are indeed invisible no more. All of us must recalibrate our activist responses to the pernicious state violence used to maintain structural racism, heteropatriarchy, transphobia, class oppression, and other manifestations of injustice in ways that reflect our now deepened understanding of how police violence affects Black women and women of color.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Beth E. Richie, author of <i>Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America&#x2019;s Prison Nation</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> is a pathbreaking, timely, and powerful expos� of police violence against Black women and women of color written by a leading advocate for race, gender, and queer justice. Andrea Ritchie not only explains with clarity why this policing constitutes systemic and structural violence that is at once racialized and gendered but also shows that resisting it requires centering the experiences of marginalized women. Essential reading for everyone committed to working for a world free of state violence.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dorothy Roberts, author of <i>Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> is the most recent book by the brilliant Black feminist legal scholar, writer, and activist Andrea Ritchie, in which she maps the brutal history of police violence against Black, Indigenous, and other women of color in what is now the United States, countering the erroneous notion that men are the only or primary victims of such violence. From settler-colonial atrocities and the school-to-prison pipeline to the experiences of transgender women, Ritchie confronts us with a set of realities too vivid to ignore. <i>Invisible No More</i> is a hard book to read, but it is a necessary read, combining cutting-edge analyses with stories, including the author&#x2019;s, that will anger, educate, and inspire you to act.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Barbara Ransby, historian, activist, author of <i>Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement</i>, and president of the National Women&#x2019;s Studies Association<br><br>&#x201c;This is a terrifying book, not only because it exposes the startling number of Black women whose lives were cut short by state-sanctioned violence or the fatal consequences of policing Black women&#x2019;s bodies. What is most disturbing is how little we know about these women and their stories. It is astounding how quickly women of color disappear when we memorialize the &#x2018;many thousands gone.&#x2019; But thanks to Andrea Ritchie&#x2019;s thorough research and raw storytelling&#x2014;capturing both the horrors and the resistance&#x2014;we can finally begin to #sayhername and end the state&#x2019;s war on women of color once and for all.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i><br><br>&#x201c;This long-awaited book from Andrea Ritchie, the leading expert on police violence against women of color, is well worth the wait. This book is quite simply stunning. Ritchie&#x2019;s analysis deeply challenges both antipolicing and antiviolence movements to expand the scope of their work to address how policing operates through gender, race, disability, and colonialism. Offering a rich genealogy of police violence, Ritchie demonstrates that, both historically and today, gender violence is central to policing. Her attention to the myriad ways policing impacts Black women and women of color is brilliant. A crucial and paradigm-shifting book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Andrea Smith, author of <i>Conquest: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genocide</i><br><br>&#x201c;With <i>Invisible No More</i>, Andrea Ritchie has produced a work of great scope and depth, tightly documented and deeply moving. Ritchie spans multiple centuries, nations, issues, and identity lenses to lay bare the effects of violent policing on women of color. She authentically and skillfully centers Black women while seeding the ground for alliances among women of color, and she gives us a thorough consideration of the experiences of women with disabilities. Most importantly, she introduces us to a generation of fighters we can follow, support, and lift up.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rinku Sen, executive director of Race Forward<br><br>&#x201c;Andrea Ritchie&#x2019;s <i>Invisible No More</i> is a powerful affirmation of why our movement has to be rooted in exposing and advocating for Black women and girls who experience state brutality. We saw with cases such as those of Sandra Bland, Gynnya McMillen, Kayla Moore, and Joyce Curnell how mainstream media and policymakers ignore police brutality against Black women. <i>Invisible No More</i> is a powerful tool that analyzes our criminal justice system&#x2019;s practices and patterns that maintain this problem. Through her writing, Ritchie has created the opportunity to do more than amplify police violence against Black women and to enable Color of Change and other movement organizations to also identify the intervention points where we can make real change happen in order to create a just and safe society for all Black people, especially cis and trans women and girls.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change<br><br>&#x201c;Andrea Ritchie&#x2019;s work is a vital contribution to our understanding of policing and criminalization, exposing how women, trans, and gender-nonconforming people are targeted. Ritchie&#x2019;s intersectional analysis exposes how policing operates off racialized-gendered structures that target people with disabilities, Black mothers, Indigenous women, and others made hypervisible and/or invisible by white gender norms. This is the tool we need in this exact moment, as grassroots resistance to police violence grows alongside an increasing emboldenment of racist law enforcement.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dean Spade, author of <i>Normal Life: Administrative Violence, Critical Trans Politics, and the Limits of Law</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> is more than a book about police accountability; it is an important read that interrogates policing practices at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and ability. By examining how culpability has been constructed to facilitate the dehumanization and criminalization of women and girls of color, Ritchie skillfully presents the transgenerational trauma produced by centuries of overt and covert state violence against cis and transgender women and girls of color in the United States.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Monique W. Morris, author of <i>Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> is not only a hard testament to the true nature of policing in the United States upon Black, Indigenous, and other women of color but also to our foremothers&#x2019; relentless resistance; to their gifts of truth, kinship, and radical love; and to their will to see us and our own freedom dreams come to fruition.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Paulina Helm-Hernandez, former codirector of Southerners on New Ground<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> is a thorough and compelling documentation of police abuses against and human rights violations experienced by Black, Latinx, and Indigenous women, other women of color, and trans women and men that should pierce the conscience of even those most resistant to calls for police accountability. Most importantly, it serves as a powerful call to action to all who care about women&#x2014;that we must demand a complete rethinking of what justice is for those who have been denied, and that we must commit to fighting for that vision together. I&#x2019;m grateful to Andrea Ritchie for her personal courage in telling the stories of these women and her own story, and assuring that none will be forgotten.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Invisible No More</i> thoroughly demonstrates why we must radically reframe the criminal justice stories that too often present the myopic view that the torture and inhumane deprivation of life of men of color are the only pressing issues in the criminal (in)justice system and prison industrial complex. Andrea Ritchie&#x2019;s meticulous documentation and masterful writing emphasize why it is imperative that we examine the roles of race, gender, gender identity, and sexuality when we talk about and work on eradicating racial profiling, police brutality, mass incarceration, and other forms of state-sanctioned violence in the United States. <i>Invisible No More</i> is an invaluable organizing resource that is required reading for anyone interested in violence against women, criminal justice, and radical social change.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Aishah Shahidah Simmons, producer/writer/director of <i>NO! The Rape Documentary</i><br><br>&#x201c;This compelling, essential, and deeply informed book exposes the impact of policing, criminalization, and violence on the lives of Black women and women of color in the United States. Ritchie is at once eloquent and forensic in centering the experience of Black women of all genders and colors to build an urgent argument to reconstitute the policing function itself.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Urvashi Vaid, attorney and author of <i>Irresistible Revolution: Confronting Race, Class, and the Assumptions of LGBT Politics</i><br><br>&#x201c;Reading this book is hard but critically important&#x2014;and essential for our political education. The stories and timeline are both well researched and needed, and they taught me things I wasn&#x2019;t aware of and am grateful to learn. If Andrea Ritchie hadn&#x2019;t documented these histories, I&#x2019;m afraid no one else would have.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Coya White-Hat Artichoker (Lakota), founding member of the First Nations Two Spirit Collective<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Invisible No More</i>, Andrea Ritchie draws from her experiences as an organizer, researcher, activist, agitator, immigrant, and survivor to paint a tear- and blood-splattered portrait that illustrates with depth and clarity the shared struggles of women of color in the United States of America. Ritchie, however, doesn&#x2019;t rest on that commonality. With painstaking care, she explores difference, privilege, and the layers of oppression that often mask the specific struggles of Indigenous, immigrant, and Black women in a country that hates us for our freedom. Ritchie speaks unapologetically from the margins, tackling white supremacy, police brutality, gender, and class with a deft hand and a full heart. She makes it abundantly clear that women of color are under constant threat of violence from all corners and always have been. Ritchie&#x2019;s work is invaluable to me as a journalist, and with this book, she continues to show that writing is resistance and that if liberation is our true goal, then Black women and girls can be invisible no more.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kirsten West Savali, senior writer and editor at TheRoot.com</p><h2>A Song of Ice and Fire (7 Volumes), Book Cover May Vary</h2><p>A Game of Thrones Box Set George R.R Martin, The series on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines with a broad ensemble cast.</p><p>George R.R.

The book is divided into five weeks and concludes with a five-day epilogue on how to make our&nbsp;homes-Homes Of Prayer Everyday. The first week of daily devotions covers the importance of prayer. In this section the reader will learn about praying because of who God is and because we are made in His image. Prayer is a profound priviledge and expression of our relationship with God. In the second week of devotions, DeVries explains the priorities in prayer. Instead of of praying, we&nbsp;often deal with little emergencies, agonize over problems, create plans, and throw ourselves into projects and lose our sense of direction. During the third week of devotions, the author focuses on praying for our neighbors. Praying for neighbors is so important that failure to do this is actually a sin against God!&nbsp; Could it be that the evils in our cities are due in part to the fact that we&nbsp;aren't praying faithfully for our neighbors? The fourth week considers the question, "How should we pray?&nbsp;DeVries uses the Lord's prayer as an outline of a conversation with God-like any conversation between friends. The fifth week stresses the power of prayer as Christians pray as royal priests.&nbsp;The author inspires the readers&nbsp;through vivid examples and actual accounts of how prayer has transformed the nation of India. After each meditation there are reflection and discussion questions for both personal and small group uses.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. John DeVries is a pastor and the founder of two ministries:, Project Philip-a domestic discipleship and Bible distribution ministry, and Mission India-the largest and fastest growing missionary enterprise today in the nation of India. DeVries is the author of many books and Bible study materials that have been used around the world. He has actively trained church planters and pastors in many different countries and has initiated prayer movements in India&#39;s 28 states. John and his wife Atts live in Grand Rapids, Michigan."I have often thought of little Andrew on Poppa's lap as they lumbered off on the tractor to do some field work. This image strikes me as a picture of myself in prayer. Prayer is the dependent relationship in which I sit on the lap of my heavenly Father and put my hand on His as He steers the tractor. After all, He not only owns and drives the tractor, but He also owns the Farm!"<br> -Excerpt, Day 2</p><h2>Best Practice, Fourth Edition: Bringing Standards to Life in America&#39;s Classrooms</h2><p><p><em><em>"The single most powerful variable in student achievement is the quality of teaching.

It suppplies much of what is missing in traditional approaches to alcoholic rehabilitation. I believe that this book can save lives." <br>Leo Galland, M.D.<br>Open this book and you will embark on a groundbreaking seven-week journey that will change your life. You will learn how to break your addiction to alcohol and end your cravings--and do it under your own power. Here, step-by-step, is a proven, seven-week program developed by Dr. Joan Matthews Larson at the innovative Health Recovery Center in Minneapolis, that subdues your body's addictive chemistry and puts you on the path to full recovery.</p><p>In recent decades, many of those studying alcoholism have come to see it as a disease, rather than as a character flaw or a failure of will. And yet, alcoholism is most often treated through counseling. Joan Mathews Larson and her colleagues at the Health Recovery Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, discovered a series of nutritional deficiencies in alcoholics, and found that with proper dietary adjustments, they could help almost three-quarters of their patients kick the bottle for good. <i>Seven Weeks to Sobriety</i> is the updated version of the less interestingly titled <i>Alcoholism--The Biochemical Connection</i>, which was published in 1992.<b>Joan Mathews Larson, Ph.D.,</b> is the author of the national bestseller <i>Seven Weeks to Sobriety</i>. She holds a doctorate in nutrition and is the founder and executive director of the highly esteemed Health Recovery Center in Minneapolis. It was the loss of her seventeen-year-old son to suicide that fueled her search for more effective solutions to emotional healing. Her clinic has now successfully treated several thousand people over a twenty-year period. She lives in Minneapolis.</p><h2>Kamishibai Man</h2><p>The Kamishibai man used to ride his bicycle into town where he would tell stories to the children and sell them candy, but gradually, fewer and fewer children came running at the sound of his clappers. They were all watching their new televisions instead. Finally, only one boy remained, and he had no money for candy. Years later, the Kamishibai man and his wife made another batch of candy, and he pedaled into town to tell one more story&#x2014;his own. When he comes out of the reverie of his memories, he looks around to see he is surrounded by familiar faces&#x2014;the children he used to entertain have returned, all grown up and more eager than ever to listen to his delightful tales. <br><br>Using two very different yet remarkable styles of art, Allen Say tells a tale within a tale, transporting readers seamlessly to the Japan of his memories.</p><p><p>Allen Say was born in Yokohama, Japan, in 1937. He dreamed of becoming a cartoonist from the age of six, and, at age twelve, apprenticed himself to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei. For the next four years, Say learned to draw and paint under the direction of Noro, who has remained Say's mentor. Say illustrated his first children's book -- published in 1972 -- in a photo studio between shooting assignments. For years, Say continued writing and illustrating children's books on a part-time basis. But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master's studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children's books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 1-5&#x2013;An elderly kamishibai (paper theater) man decides to return to the city and spend the day on his former rounds. His wife makes candies for him, just as in the past, and he sets off on his bicycle. Things have changed&#x2013;there's traffic with honking horns and he wonders, Who needs to buy so many things and eat so many different foods? when he sees the shops and restaurants replacing beautiful trees that have been cut. He sets up his theater and begins to tell his personal story of being a kamishibai man in a flashback sequence. Soon he is surrounded by adults who remember him and his stories from their youth. Ironically, that night he is featured on the news on television&#x2013;the very technology that replaced him. Say's distinctive style and facial expressions are especially touching. A foreword gives readers a glimpse of the importance of the kamishibai man in the author's early life, and an afterword provides a historical look at the forgotten art form. The power of the story and the importance of the storyteller are felt in this nostalgic piece that makes readers think about progress. Those interested in storytelling and theater will be especially impressed with this offering, but it will have broad appeal.<i>&#x2013;Helen Foster James, University of California at San Diego</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are more than thirty million copies of her books in print. She lives in Texas.&nbsp;<b>"Chapter One"</b><br><br>Fifteen servants wearing the traditional blue and silver livery of the Earl of Cameron left Havenhurst at dawn on the same day. All of them carried identical, urgent messages that Lady Elizabeth's uncle, Mr. Julius Cameron, had directed them to deliver at fifteen homes throughout England.<br><br>The recipients of these messages all had only one thing in common: They had once offered for Lady Elizabeth's hand in marriage.<br><br>All fifteen of these gentlemen, upon reading the message, exhibited shock at its contents. Some of them were incredulous, others derisive, and still others cruelly satisfied. Twelve of them promptly wrote out replies declining Julius Cameron's outrageous suggestion, then they hurried off in search of friends with whom they could sham this unsurpassed, delicious piece of incredible gossip.<br><br>Three of the recipients reacted differently.<br><br>Lord John Marchman had just returned from his favorite daily pastime of hunting when the Havenhurst servant arrived at his home, and a footman brought him the message. "I'll be damned," he breathed as he read. The message stated that Mr. Julius Cameron was desirous of seeing his niece, Lady Elizabeth Cameron, suitably and immediately wed. To that end, Mr. Cameron said he would now be willing to reconsider John's previously rejected offer for Lady Elizabeth's hand. Cognizant of the year and a half that had passed since they had been in each other's company, Julius Cameron volunteered to send his niece, properly chaperoned, to spend a night with John so that they might "renew their acquaintance."<br><br>Unable to believe what he was reading, Lord Marchman paced the floor and read the entire message twice more. "I'll be damned," he said again. Raking a hand through his sandy hair, he glanced distractedly at the wall beside him, which was completely covered with his most prized possessions -- the heads of the animals he'd hunted in Europe and abroad. A moose stared back at him through glazed eyes; beside it a wild boar snarled. Reaching up, he scratched the moose behind its antlers in an affectionate, if ludicrous, gesture that expressed his gratitude for the splendid day of hunting that particular prize had afforded him.<br><br>A vision of Elizabeth Cameron danced enchantingly before his eyes -- an incredibly lovely face with green eyes, cameo skin, and soft, smiling lips. A year and a half ago, when he'd met her, he'd thought her the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. After meeting her only twice he'd been so taken with the charming, unaffected seventeen-year-old girl that he'd dashed off to her brother and offered for her, only to be coldly rejected. <br><br>Evidently Elizabeth's uncle, who was now her guardian, judged John by different standards.<br><br>Perhaps the lovely Lady Elizabeth herself had been behind this decision; perhaps their two meetings in the park had meant as much to her as they had to him.<br><br>Getting up, John wandered over to the third wall, which held a variety of fishing poles, and thoughtfully selected one. The trout would be biting this afternoon, he decided as he remembered Elizabeth's magnificent honey-colored hair. Her hair had glistened in the sunlight, reminding him of the shimmering scales of a beautiful trout as it breaks the water. The analogy seemed so perfect and so poetic that Lord Marchman stopped, spellbound by his own phrasing, and put the fishing pole down. He would compliment Elizabeth's hair in exactly those words, he decided, when he accepted her uncle's offer and she came to his home next month.<br><br>Sir Francis Belhaven, the fourteenth recipient of Julius Cameron's message, read it while sitting in his bedchamber wrapped in a satin dressing gown, his mistress naked and waiting for him in his bed across the room.<br><br>"Francis, darling," she purred, raking her long fingernails down the satin sheets, "what's important enough about that message to keep you over there instead of here?"<br><br>He looked up and frowned at the sound her nails were making. "Don't scratch the sheets, love," he said. "They cost �30 apiece."<br><br>"If you cared about me," she countered, careful not to sound as if she was whining, "you wouldn't give a thought to the cost." Francis Belhaven was so tightfisted that there were times Eloise wondered if marrying him would gain her more than a gown or two a year.<br><br>"If you cared about me," he countered smoothly, "You'd be more careful with my coin."<br><br>At five and forty Francis Belhaven had never been married, but he'd never lacked for feminine companionship. He enjoyed women immensely -- their bodies, their faces, their bodies...<br><br>Now, however, he needed a legitimate heir, and for that he needed a wife. During the last year he'd been giving a good deal of thought to his rather stringent requirements for the lucky young lady he would eventually choose. He wanted a young wife as well as a beautiful wife with money of her own so she wouldn't squander his.<br><br>Glancing up from Julius's message, he gazed hungrily at Eloise's breasts and mentally added a new requirement for his future wife: She must be understanding about his sensual appetite and his need for variety on his sexual menu. It would not do for her to pucker up like a prune merely because he was involved in one trivial little affair or another. At the age of forty-five, he had no intention of being ruled by some chit with pious notions of morality and fidelity.<br><br>A vision of Elizabeth Cameron was superimposed against his naked mistress. What a lush little beauty she'd been when he'd offered for her nearly two years ago. Her breasts had been ripe, her waist tiny, her face... unforgettable. Her fortune...adequate. Since then gossip had it that she was practically destitute after her brother's mysterious disappearance, but her uncle had indicated that she would bring a sizable dowry, which meant the gossip was as wrong as always.<br><br>"Francis!"<br><br>Arising, he walked over to the bed and sat down beside Eloise. Caressingly he laid a hand on her hip, but he reached for the bell pull with his other hand. "A moment, my darling," he said as a servant rushed into the bedchamber. He handed over the note and said, "Instruct my secretary to send an affirmative reply."<br><br>The last invitation was forwarded from Ian Thornton's London town house to Montmayne, his country estate, where it appeared on his desk among a mountain of business and social correspondence awaiting his attention. Ian opened Julius Cameron's missive while he was in the midst of rapid-fire dictation to his new secretary, and he did not take nearly so long to make a decision as Lord John Marchman or Sir Francis Belhaven.<br><br>He stared at it in utter disbelief while his secretary, Peters, who'd only been with him for a fortnight, muttered a silent prayer of gratitude for the break and continued scribbling as fast as he could, trying futilely to catch up with his employees dictation.<br><br>"This," said Ian curdy, "was sent to me either by mistake or as a joke. In either case, it's in excruciatingly bad taste." A memory of Elizabeth Cameron flickered across Ian's mind -- a mercenary, shallow little flirt with a face and body that had drugged his mind. She'd been betrothed to a viscount when he'd met her. Obviously she hadn't married her viscount -- no doubt she'd jilted him in favor of someone with even better prospects. The English nobility, as he well knew, married only for prestige and money, then looked elsewhere for sexual fufillment. Evidently Elizabeth Cameron's relatives were putting her back on the marriage block. If so, they must be damned eager to unload her if they were willing to forsake a title for Ian's money....That line of conjecture seemed so unlikely that Ian dismissed it. This note was obviously a stupid prank, perpetrated, no doubt, by someone who remembered the gossip that had exploded over that weekend house party -- someone who thought he'd find the note amusing.<br><br>Completely dismissing the prankster and Elizabeth Cameron from his mind, Ian glanced at his harassed secretary who was frantically scribbling away. "No reply is necessary," he said. As he spoke he flipped the message across his desk toward his secretary, but the white parchment slid across the polished oak and floated to the floor. Peters made an awkward dive to catch it, but as he lurched sideways all the other correspondence that went with his dictation slid off his lap onto the floor. "I -- I'm sorry, sir," he stammered, leaping up and trying to collect the dozens of pieces of paper he'd scattered on the carpet. "Extremely sorry, Mr. Thornton," he added, frantically snatching up contracts, invitations and letters and shoving them into a disorderly pile.<br><br>His employer appeared not to bear him. He was already rapping out more instructions and passing the corresponding invitations and letters across the desk. "Decline the first three, accept the fourth, decline the fifth. Send my condolences on this one. On this one, explain that I'm going to be in Scotland, and send an invitation to join me there, along with directions to the cottage."<br><br>Clutching the papers to his chest, Peters poked big face up on the opposite side of the desk. "Yes, Mr. Thorton!" he said, trying to sound confident. But it was hard to be confident when one was on one's knees. Harder still when one wasn't entirely certain which instructions of the morning went with which invitation or piece of correspondence.<br><br>Ian Thornton spent the rest of the afternoon closeted with Peters, heaping more dictation on the inundated clerk.<br><br>He spent the evening with the Earl of Melbourne, his future father-in-law, discussing the betrothal contract being drawn up between the earl's daughter and himself.<br><br>Peters spent part of his evening trying to learn from the butler which invitations his employer was likely to accept or reject.<br><br>Copyright � 1990 by Eagle Syndication Inc.</p><h2>The Most Important Year: Pre-Kindergarten and the Future of Our Children</h2><p><b>An eye-opening look inside pre-K in America and what it will take to give all children the best start in school possible.</b><br> At the heart of this groundbreaking book are two urgent questions: What do our young children need in the earliest years of school, and how do we ensure that they all get it? Cutting-edge research has proven that early childhood education is crucial for all children to gain the academic and emotional skills they need to succeed later in life.&nbsp; Children who attend quality pre-K programs have a host of positive outcomes including better language, literacy, problem-solving and math skills down the line, and they have a leg up on what appears to be the most essential skill to develop at age four:&nbsp; strong self-control.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even with this overwhelming evidence, early childhood education is at a crossroads in America.&nbsp; We know that children can and do benefit, but we also know that too many of our littlest learners don&#x2019;t get that chance&#x2014;millions of parents can&#x2019;t find spots for their children, or their preschoolers end up in poor quality programs. <br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </i>With engrossing storytelling, journalist Suzanne Bouffard takes us inside some of the country&#x2019;s best pre-K classrooms to reveal the sometimes surprising ingredients that make them work&#x2014;and to understand why some programs are doing the opposite of what is best for children. It also chronicles the stories of families and teachers from many backgrounds as they struggle to give their children a good start in school. This book is a call to arms when we are at a crucial moment, and perhaps on the verge of a missed opportunity: We now have the means and the will to have universal pre-kindergarten, but we are also in grave danger of not getting it right.</p><p><b>Suzanne Bouffard</b> is a writer with a background in child development and education.

It wasn&#x2019;t long into her overview, which she had been giving for months during similar school tours, before an anxious parent asked, &#x201c;How many pre-K spots do you have for next year?&#x201d; &#x201c;We have thirty-two seats,&#x201d; Griffith replied smoothly, quickly adding, &#x201c;But we have four kindergarten classrooms, so that means there are forty-four new seats in kindergarten every year.&#x201d; That provided little reassurance for the parents who would soon be entering their four-year-olds in the Boston Public Schools (BPS) lottery. Griffith didn&#x2019;t have to say what many already knew: all but three of the Eliot&#x2019;s current pre-K students had been virtually guaranteed a spot because they had a sibling already attending the school.<br> &nbsp;<br> The odds were long for Luca Murthy, but he was blissfully unaware of the stress his parents and so many others were carrying. Luca was only three and was more concerned with Legos than lotteries. But he would turn four before the next school year, making him eligible for one of the nation&#x2019;s most successful public pre-kindergarten programs, or what the Boston Public Schools call K1. (The grade traditionally called kindergarten is known as K2.) Luca, his family&#x2019;s firstborn, wouldn&#x2019;t have the advantage of a sibling spot at the Eliot, and he wasn&#x2019;t guaranteed a K1 spot at all. The Boston program serves only about twenty-five hundred children, around half the city&#x2019;s four-year-olds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Above the cafeteria, in Jodi Krous&#x2019;s classroom, it was easy to see why parents wanted to send their children to the Eliot for pre-K. Sixteen children were engrossed in activities set up at tiny natural wood furniture and in woven baskets full of books, puzzles, and art supplies. They were energetic and talkative, but calm and focused. On the rug, some used large wooden blocks to experiment with ramps and how fast toy cars would go depending on the angle of the blocks. At the easel, Krous asked two girls what they were painting and wrote their responses on the bottom of the paper so that when she hung it up later, everyone could see their thought processes. A quiet, reluctant boy got a hug from Krous and a reminder that his mother would be coming home from a business trip that night. &#x201c;Yesterday you made a great double-decker bus out of Play-Doh. Do you want to make another one?&#x201d; Krous suggested. &#x201c;Oh, look, your friend wants to know what a double-decker bus is!&#x201d; She bent down, gently touching the boy&#x2019;s shoulders, encouraging him to look directly at the other child and share his expertise with her. Krous had told me that she chose to teach at the Eliot because &#x201c;you feel a lot of joyfulness here,&#x201d; and the parents on the tour seemed to sense it, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> Krous seemed to accomplish the impossible task of noticing everything happening in the room at once, providing just the right question or comment to nudge the children to think a little more deeply. When a child proudly approached her with a book he had made using familiar story characters, she shared his enthusiasm and then prodded him to write down the words the characters might say. Watching children mixing and painting with watercolors, she asked them, &#x201c;What happens when you use different-sized paintbrushes?&#x201d; When she used the word &#x201c;water&#x201d; while talking about painting, she noticed that a nonverbal child used sign language to say &#x201c;drink,&#x201d; showing she heard Krous&#x2019;s words. Another boy came over to show her how he had pasted the letters of his name on cardstock. &#x201c;Wow, you have eight letters in your name!&#x201d; Krous exclaimed. &#x201c;Do you have the longest name? Go find Olivia&#x2019;s name. Find the one that starts with an <i>O</i>. Now count how many. What about Matthew?&#x201d; When she asked him how he got his correct answer of seven, he cheerfully replied, &#x201c;I counted already!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was obvious that every moment of the school day was thoughtfully planned to facilitate children&#x2019;s learning, and that appealed to Luca&#x2019;s mother, Maria Fenwick. An educational consultant and former Boston Public Schools teacher, Fenwick had done her homework. She had long known about the Eliot and been drawn to the hands-on experiential learning that is a hallmark of the school. She had heard that Griffith and her staff were knowledgeable and dedicated, and that was clear in Room 105, from the rhyming songs Krous led during morning meeting to build vocabulary and language skills (&#x201c;How are you, caribou? I&#x2019;m fine, porcupine!&#x201d;) to the way she asked children to tell her stories that would be transcribed and later acted out by the class. Fenwick was particularly impressed with the way that evidence of the students&#x2019; learning covered the walls. At children&#x2019;s eye level were detailed self-portraits they had drawn during a unit on color, birth certificates created for pretend infants during a unit on families, photographs of block architecture annotated with descriptions of how the children made them. Each child&#x2019;s contribution was unique and creative, no evidence of photocopied worksheets anywhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> Almost any parent would walk into Krous&#x2019;s classroom and want to send her child there. But few get that opportunity. The thirty-two spots at the Eliot, a nearly hundred-year-old school located in the city&#x2019;s historic North End, are among the most coveted in the district. &#x201c;When I call parents to tell them they have a spot at our school, I get to tell them, &#x2018;You have won the lottery&#x2014;literally,&#x2019;&#x201d; says Traci Griffith. Less than ten years ago, however, the Eliot was undersubscribed, ranked near the very bottom of the city&#x2019;s schools, a site of hopelessness and apathy that had been abandoned by neighborhood families. Less than a block away from the Eliot are a statue of school alumnus Paul Revere in the spot where he began his famous midnight ride, and the Old North Church, where patriots hung lanterns to give the &#x201c;one if by land, two if by sea&#x201d; signal. The change that has taken place at the Eliot has been less fiery than the war fought by the American patriots, but no less transformational. The introduction of the K1 program was not solely responsible for the transformation, but it played an important role, drumming up parent interest in the school, building early and long-lasting relationships between children and staff, and laying the crucial foundation for school success that high-quality preschool can provide.</p><h2>The Great Dinosaur Mystery and the Bible</h2><p><p>Children often have a big problem understanding how dinosaurs fit with Creation and the Bible.

However, as Sarah Flack explains in <em>The Art and Science of Grazing</em>, the pasture/livestock relationship is incredibly complex. If a farmer doesn&#x2019;t pay close attention to how the animals are grazing, the resulting poorly managed grazing system can be harmful to the health of the livestock, pasture plants, and soils. Well-managed pastures can instead create healthier animals, a diverse and resilient pasture ecosystem, and other benefits. Flack delves deeply below the surface of &#x201c;let the cows eat grass,&#x201d; demonstrating that grazing management is a sophisticated science that requires mastery of plant and animal physiology, animal behavior, and ecology. She also shows readers that applying grazing management science on a working farm is an art form that calls on grass farmers to be careful observers, excellent planners and record-keepers, skillful interpreters of their observations, and creative troubleshooters.&nbsp;<br> <br> <em>The Art and Science of Grazing</em> will allow farmers to gain a solid understanding of the key principles of grazing management so they can both design and manage successful grazing systems. The book&#x2019;s unique approach presents information first from the perspective of pasture plants, and then from the livestock perspective&#x2015;helping farmers understand both plant and animal needs before setting up a grazing system.<br> <br> This book is an essential guide for ruminant farmers who want to be able to create grazing systems that meet the needs of their livestock, pasture plants, soils, and the larger ecosystem. The book discusses all the practical details that are critical for sustained success: how to set up a new system or improve existing systems; acreage calculations; paddock layout; fence and drinking water access; lanes and other grazing infrastructure; managing livestock movement and flow; soil fertility; seeding and reseeding pastures; and more. The author includes descriptions of real grazing systems working well on dairy, beef, goat, and sheep farms in different regions of North America. The book covers pasture requirements specific to organic farming, but will be of use to both organic and non-organic farms.</p></p><p><p>Sarah Flack is the author of <em>Organic Dairy Production</em> and a nationally known consultant on grazing and organic livestock. She grew up on a Vermont family farm that used management-intensive grazing and mob stocking. She later studied Holistic Planned Grazing and pursued graduate studies on pasture management at the University of Vermont. She has written extensively about grass farming and is known for teaching workshops that take a practical approach to applying the science of grazing. Sarah has successfully helped many farmers create positive change in their pastures, soils, livestock, finances, and farm-family quality of life.</p><p><strong><em>CHOICE</em>-</strong></p> <p>"This is a great book. After reading this work, the reviewer felt as if he could almost start his own grazing system; the title provides readers with the right questions to ask. Flack (a consultant on grazing and organic livestock) is a concise and articulate author and educator. She knows the value of telling a simple story and supporting it with relevant illustrations. She has an elegant style and knows how to use the power of repetition to show how no part of grazing management is wholly independent. She has biases with respect to the best grazing management, but is evenhanded in presenting multiple alternatives to grazing issues. Her case studies are aptly chosen to illustrate how the grazing management she advocates can be both sustainable and profitable. Each chapter plays a role and successively builds on the knowledge previously gained. As a manual for introducing good land stewardship, this book admirably succeeds. <strong>Summing Up:</strong> Highly recommended.

Starting from scratch, the US Army developed a unique military fighting force, the 10th Mountain Division, drawn from the ranks of civilian skiers, mountaineers, and others with outdoor experience. The resulting mix of Ivy League students, park rangers, Olympic skiers, and European refugees formed the first specialized alpine fighting force in US history. By the time it&nbsp;deployed to Italy at the beginning of 1945, this ragtag group&nbsp;had coalesced into a tight-knit unit.

She means that we, as a nation, are influenced by television, so many of us know how to behave in front of a camera.

Noonan addresses with a strong and clear voice why public speaking is America&#39;s number one fear and how to combat this fear. Her tones seem best suited to political commentary, and that could put off listeners who need guidance in the corporate or even casual arenas.

We learn the great lessons of our era and set out to put them all to work.</p><p>But time is a trickster. Just when you think that you've learned all the rules, some hidden umpire changes the game.</p><p>Think about the Depression Kids. Those woeful years left a legacy of fear. Forever after, the generations marked by the 1930s saved compulsively. A loan made them feel sick to their stomachs. They took no risks. When the Great Prosperity swelled around them, they mistrusted it. They knew in their hearts it wouldn't last.</p><p>Now think about the Inflation Kids, raised in the 1960s and 1970s. They saw in a flash that a dollar saved was a dollar lost because inflation ate it up. A dollar borrowed was a dollar saved. You could use it to buy a car or a stereo before the price went up. They learned to love debt and couldn't change.</p><p>Then came the Bubble Kids of the 1980s and 1990s -- years when stock and bond values soared, real estate boomed, and everyone thought it was going to be easy to get rich. Even after the bust, they didn't save much, because they still trusted "the market" or "home equity" to rebuild their wealth automatically. Can they change their approach to money any better than earlier generations could?</p><p>The new turn of the wheel -- the 2008 financial bust -- is bringing us the Struggle Kids. They endured the Great Recession, with jobs hard to get, layoffs and wage-cuts common, foreclosures and bankruptcies wiping families out, investments unreliable, health care expensive, and global interconnections that no generation has grown up with before. They're saving more and spending less. What will their orthodoxies be? Can we all find a better place to stand? On the answer to those questions, everything depends.</p><p><b>A Cycle of Spending and Saving</b></p><p>Money comes and goes in your life at different times. Mostly goes, when you're young. Those are the spent years. Maybe the misspent years. But never mind. As you grow older, the urge to save creeps up on you. Here's the typical cycle of wealth:</p><p><b>Ages 20 to 30</b>. You establish credit, buy your first furniture and appliances, take out your first auto loan, learn about insurance and taxes. Maybe (here I'm dreaming) you save a little money, in the bank or in company retirement accounts. Retirement accounts are money machines for young people because you have so many years to let them grow untaxed. By the end of the decade, you cohabitate or get married, maybe have a baby, buy a house. (You save for a house the old-fashioned way: by borrowing some of the down payment from your parents.) Entrepreneurs start a business.</p><p><b>Ages 31 to 45</b>. You don't know where your money goes. Bills, bills, bills. College is a freight train headed your way. Maybe (here I'm dreaming again) you start a tuition savings account. Money still dribbles into retirement savings, but only if your company does it for you -- by taking it out of your paycheck before you get it to spend. When you're pressed, you open a home equity line of credit and borrow money against your house. If you haven't started a business, you think about it now. This is also a good time to get more education. Invest in yourself and hope for a payoff.</p><p><b>Ages 46 to 55</b>. You <i>do</i> know where your money goes: to good old State U. At the same time, you get the creepy feeling that maybe you won't live forever. You thrash around. You buy books about financial planning. You have an affair. When all else fails, you start to save.</p><p><b>Ages 56 to 65</b>. These are the fat years. You're at the top of your earning power, the kids are gone, the dogs are dead. Twenty percent of your salary can be socked away -- which is lucky because you will need extra money for your children's down payments when they buy a house (kids never really go away). Consider long-term care insurance.</p><p><b>Ages 66 to 75</b>. How golden are these years? As rich as your pension, Social Security, and the income from the money you saved. Start out by living on the first two. Let the income from savings and investments compound for a while, to build a fund for later life.</p><p><b>Ages 76 and Up</b>. Quit saving. Spend, spend, spend! Forget leaving money to your kids -- they should have put away more for themselves. Dip into principal to live as comfortably as you deserve. This is what all those years of saving were for.</p><p><b>When You Fall Off the Cycle</b></p><p>You say you can't find your place on the cycle? That's no surprise. Almost no one lives exactly to order anymore. There are a million ways of getting from birth to death, and they all work. If you fall behind financially during any decade, you'll need a plan for catching up.</p><p><b>You Have Your Children in Your 30s</b>. It seemed like a smart idea at the time: diapers tomorrow but never today. No one told you that, in your 50s, you'd be paying for college just when you were trying to save for your own retirement. (And even if they'd told you, you'd never have believed that you would ever be that old.) You might have to choose between sending your children to a low-cost college and shortchanging your own future. Maybe your children will have to pay for their education themselves. The moral, for those who can think ahead: save more in your 20s, using the discipline of tax-deferred retirement plans. These plans penalize you for drawing money out, so you're more likely to leave it in.</p><p><b>You Get Divorced and Start Over</b>. Divorce costs you assets and income, with the greater loss usually falling on the woman. She can rarely earn as much money as her exhusband takes away. For the man, a new wife and new babies might mean that college tuition bills will arrive in the same mail as the Social Security checks. Unless you're rich or remarry rich, divorce is a decision to cut your standard of living, sometimes permanently.</p><p><b>You Don't Marry</b>. You lack the safety net that a second paycheck and an inhome caregiver provide. On the other hand, there's usually no other mouth to feed. You can start saving and investing earlier than most.</p><p><b>You're Married, with No Children</b>. You've got nothing but money and plenty of it. You are one of the few who really can retire early, not just dream about it.</p><p><b>Life Deals You an Accident</b>. A crippling illness. Early widowhood. A child with anguishing medical problems. A family that has always saved can scrape through these tragedies. A family in debt to the hilt cannot.</p><p><b>You're Downsized</b>. That's today's euphemism for getting fired. The money in your retirement plan goes for current bills. Your next job pays 30 percent less, with no health insurance or retirement plan. But you can still secure your future by downscaling your life to match your income. There's honor at every monetary level of life.</p><p><b>You Get the Golden Boot</b>. A forced early retirement. Sometimes you see it coming, sometimes it blindsides you. You get a consolation prize in a lump sum payout or a higher pension for a retiree of your age. But you lose 5 to 10 years of earnings and savings. This risk is the single strongest argument for starting a retirement savings program young. At your age, a new job will be hard to come by, but you can't afford to retire for real. So you do project work, part-time work, and unexpected work such as clerking, to pad out your early-retirement check.</p><p><b>Memo to All Workers</b>: Employers don't care that you've worked hard and late, that you haven't been sick in a dozen years, or that every supervisor you've had thinks you're hot stuff. They ask only: What have you done for me lately? Is your job essential to business today? Are your skills the right ones for business tomorrow?</p><p>Few people "hold a job" anymore. Instead we have talents that we sell to employers for various projects, some longer term than others. In this kind of world, nothing is more important than continuing education and upgrading skills.</p><p><b>Who Needs What When</b></p><p>The number of financial products on the market today -- bank accounts, insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds -- I estimate conservatively at two zillion point three (2.3Z). Most of them nobody needs but buys anyway because some salesperson convinces you to. In fact, you need only a few simple things, matched to your age, your bank balance, and your responsibilities. The rest of this book tells you how to choose them. Here I offer a general framework for your thinking.</p><p><b>Young and Single</b></p><p>Admit it: you are living your life on hold. Cinderella, waiting for Prince Charming. Peter Pan, not wanting to grow up. You are serious only about your work (or finding work!). Everything else is temporary. There is nothing in your refrigerator and nothing in your bank account. "Wait until I'm married," you say. But what if you don't marry? Or you marry late? Looking back, you'll see that you lost ten good years. Your future starts now. As a young person you should:</p><p></p><blockquote><li><i>Establish credit with a low-cost bank card</i>. Practice on one card before getting two. Debt tends to rise to the highest allowable limit. If you're in college, apply for a bank card before you leave. Banks give credit faster to students than to job-seeking young adults. (They count on the parents to save their kids' credit rating by paying off their debts.)</li><li><i>Get disability insurance coverage if your employer offers it</i>. It pays you an income if you're sick or injured and can't work. How will you afford the premiums? By not buying life insurance.</li><li><i>Get health insurance if you don't have a company plan</i>. I know you're immortal, but buy a policy anyway, just in case you should be a teeny-weeny bit mortal and need an operation or a splint. No one wants a charity patient. If you can't afford a policy, maybe your parents will buy it for you. They would probably pay for the splint, so buying your health insurance is really a way of p...</li></blockquote></p><h2>Unveiling Mary Magdalene: Discover the Truth About a Not-So-Bad Girl of the Bible</h2><p><b>The veil has been lifted.<br></b><br>Discover the Gospel truth about the most myth-understood woman of the New Testament. Was Mary Magdalene a prostitute? An adulteress? The wife of Jesus? An ancient goddess? Liz Curtis Higgs, best-selling author of <i>Bad Girls of the Bible </i>and<i> Really Bad Girls of the Bible,</i> combines heartfelt contemporary fiction with extensive biblical research to bring to life the <i>real </i>Mary Magdalene of the Bible.<br><br>With her own eyes, she saw him.<br>With her own ears, she heard him.<br>With her own hands, she touched him.<br><i><br>Unveiling Mary Magdalene</i> opens with the fictional journey of Mary Margaret Delaney, a madwoman adrift in modern Chicago.&nbsp;Her moving story, closely paralleling the biblical account, is followed by a&nbsp;verse-by-verse&nbsp;study of the&nbsp;first-century Mary Magdalene and her life-changing encounters with the Christ. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Liz has done it again! What hope and promise this will bring.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><b><i>&#x2014;Kay Arthur<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;The unforgettable portrait of a courageous woman.&#x201d; <br><b><i>&#x2014;Rebecca St. James </i></b></p><p>Here&#x2019;s the truth: Mary Magdalene has been knocking at the door of my heart for ages. She got squeezed out of BAD GIRLS OF THE BIBLE when I realized I needed more time to research her complex story. Then she was dropped from the roster for REALLY BAD GIRLS OF THE BIBLE because Tamar and Bathsheba took up more than their allotted pages. (Pushy, huh?) Now I know the real reason why Mary Magdalene waited so patiently in the wings: She deserves a book all her own! <p>Come meet the genuine Mary Magdalene of the Bible&#x2013;not the scarlet-draped legend&#x2013;and follow her one-of-a-kind story of deliverance and dedication, despair and declaration. Of all the books I've written, this one is my favorite. It was previously published as MAD MARY (2001), but alas, people kept asking, "Which Mary, and who is she mad at?!" And so, a new title and a new look, but the same content, the same book. </p><p>As with my other Bad Girls books, this one opens with a contemporary, fictional take on the biblical character. Once Mary Margaret Delaney&#x2019;s story has prepared our hearts for learning, we&#x2019;ll leave her in the Windy City and go verse by verse through Mary of Magdala&#x2019;s ancient biblical tale, tossing aside modern myth-conceptions as we embrace the real Mary Magdalene.

It has intrigued some of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century, including Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman, Norbert Wiener, Brian Josephson, and Arthur Winfree.<br><br> At once elegant and riveting, <em>Sync</em> tells the story of the dawn of a new science. Steven Strogatz, a leading mathematician in the fields of chaos and complexity theory, explains how enormous systems can synchronize themselves, from the electrons in a superconductor to the pacemaker cells in our hearts. He shows that although these phenomena might seem unrelated on the surface, at a deeper level there is a connection, forged by the unifying power of mathematics.</p><p><strong>Steven Strogatz</strong> received his doctorate from Harvard University and served on the faculties of Harvard and MIT before becoming a professor of applied mathematics at Cornell Universitty in 1994. Widely recognized for his groundbreaking discoveries in chaos and complexity theory, he has received numerous awards throughout his career, including MIT's highest teaching prize and a Presidential Young Investigator Award from the White House. He lives in Ithaca, New York, with his wife, Carol, and their two daughters, Leah and Joanna.<b>Preface</b> <p>At the heart of the universe is a steady, insistent beat: the sound of cycles in sync. It pervades nature at every scale from the nucleus to the cosmos. Every night along the tidal rivers of Malaysia, thousands of fireflies congregate in the mangroves and flash in unison, without any leader or cue from the environment. Trillions of electrons march in lockstep in a superconductor, enabling electricity to flow through it with zero resistance. In the solar system, gravitational synchrony can eject huge boulders out of the asteroid belt and toward Earth; the cataclysmic impact of one such meteor is thought to have killed the dinosaurs. Even our bodies are symphonies of rhythm, kept alive by the relentless, coordinated firing of thousands of pacemaker cells in our hearts. In every case, these feats of synchrony occur spontaneously, almost as if nature has an eerie yearning for order. </p><p>And that raises a profound mystery: Scientists have long been baffled by the existence of spontaneous order in the universe. The laws of thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite, that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder, greater entropy. Yet all around us we see magnificent structures -- galaxies, cells, ecosystems, human beings -- that have somehow managed to assemble themselves. This enigma bedevils all of science today. Only in a few situations do we have a clear understanding of how order arises on its own. The first case to yield was a particular kind of order <i>in physical space</i> involving perfectly repetitive architectures. It's the kind of order that occurs whenever the temperature drops below the freezing point and trillions of water molecules spontaneously lock themselves into a rigid, symmetrical crystal of ice. Explaining order <i>in time</i>, however, has proved to be more problematic. Even the simplest possibility, where the same things happen at the same times, has turned out to be remarkably subtle. This is the order we call synchrony. </p><p>It may seem at first that there's little to explain. You can agree to meet a friend at a restaurant, and if both of you are punctual, your arrivals will be synchronized. An equally mundane kind of synchrony is triggered by a reaction to a common stimulus. Pigeons startled by a car backfiring will all take off at the same time, and their wings may even flap in sync for a while, but only because they reacted the same way to the same noise. They're not actually communicating about their flapping rhythm and don't maintain their synchrony after the first few seconds. Other kinds of transient sync can arise by chance. On a Sunday morning, the bells of two different churches may happen to ring at the same time for a while, and then drift apart. Or while sitting in your car, waiting to turn at a red light, you might notice that your blinker is flashing in perfect time with that of the car ahead of you, at least for a few beats. Such sync is pure coincidence, and hardly worth noting. </p><p>The impressive kind of sync is persistent. When two things keep happening simultaneously for an extended period of time, the synchrony is probably not an accident. Such persistent sync comes easily to us human beings, and, for some reason, it often gives us pleasure. We like to dance together, sing in a choir, play in a band. In its most refined form, persistent sync can be spectacular, as in the kickline of the Rockettes or the matched movements of synchronized swimmers. The feeling of artistry is heightened when the audience has no idea where the music is going next, or what the next dance move will be. We interpret persistent sync as a sign of intelligence, planning, and choreography. </p><p>So when sync occurs among unconscious entities like electrons or cells, it seems almost miraculous. It's surprising enough to see animals cooperating -- thousands of crickets chirping in unison on a summer night; the graceful undulating of schools of fish -- but it's even more shocking to see mobs of mindless things falling into step by themselves. These phenomena are so incredible that some commentators have been led to deny their existence, attributing them to illusions, accidents, or perceptual errors. Other observers have soared into mysticism, attributing sync to supernatural forces in the cosmos. </p><p>Until just a few years ago, the study of synchrony was a splintered affair, with biologists, physicists, mathematicians, astronomers, engineers, and sociologists laboring in their separate fields, pursuing seemingly independent lines of inquiry. Yet little by little, a science of sync has begun coalescing out of insights from these and other disciplines. This new science centers on the study of "coupled oscillators." Groups of fireflies, planets, or pacemaker cells are all collections of oscillators -- entities that cycle automatically, that repeat themselves over and over again at more or less regular time intervals. Fireflies flash; planets orbit; pacemaker cells fire. Two or more oscillators are said to be coupled if some physical or chemical process allows them to influence one another. Fireflies communicate with light. Planets tug on one another with gravity. Heart cells pass electrical currents back and forth. As these examples suggest, nature uses every available channel to allow its oscillators to talk to one another. And the result of those conversations is often synchrony, in which all the oscillators begin to move as one. </p><p>Those of us working in this emerging field are asking such questions as: How exactly do coupled oscillators synchronize themselves, and under what conditions? When is sync impossible and when is it inevitable? What other modes of organization are to be expected when sync breaks down? And what are the practical implications of all that we're trying to learn? </p><p>Copyright � 2003 Steven Strogatz</p></p><h2>The Black Tower (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #5)</h2><p>Scotland Yard Inspector Adam Dalgliesh races to solve a twisted murder in bestselling author P.D.

Feynman's insights and an essential companion to his legendary <i>Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. </b><br><br>With characteristic flair, insight, and humor, Feynman discusses topics physics students often struggle with and offers valuable tips on addressing them. Included here are three lectures on problem-solving and a lecture on inertial guidance omitted from <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. An enlightening memoir by Matthew Sands and oral history interviews with Feynman and his Caltech colleagues provide firsthand accounts of the origins of Feynman's landmark lecture series.

For this is the full story of the world's most dramatic execution, as it affected one of its least-known participants-the man who hurled his spear into Christ on the Cross.<p>Among his many successful historical novels, Louis de Wohl considered&nbsp;<i>The Spear</i>&nbsp;the magnum opus of his literary career.</p></p><p>Louis de Wohl wrote numerous historical novels for adults, including &#34;The Living Wood&#34;, which is also about St. Helena and Constantine. He earned international acclaim for The Spear, and among his other popular titles are &#34;Lay Siege to Heaven, The Restless Flame, The Joyful Beggar &#34;and &#34;The Quiet Light.&#34;</p><h2>Shankara&#39;s Crest Jewel of Discrimination</h2><p>A classic text on the path to God through knowledge. The basic teaching is that God alone is the all-pervading reality; the individual soul is none other than the universal soul. <p>According to Shankara, it is the ignorance of our real nature that causes suffering and pain. The desire for happiness is essentially a longing to awaken to who and what we truly are. </p><p>Through the path of self-knowledge, Shankara clearly teaches how to awaken from ignornce created by the mind, and abide in the peace of our true nature.</p></p><p>Shankara was under no illusions about this world. For this reason, he is able to describe so powerfully the complete transformation of the universe that takes place before the eyes of the illumined seer, when the world indeed becomes a paradise.Shankara is considered to be the leading source on the teachings of non-dualism and Vedanta.</p><h2>The Art of Being</h2><p>This classic work by psychologist and social philosopher Eric Fromm builds upon his previous popular book <i>To Have or to Be? The Art of Being</i> teaches us to avoid the tantalizing illusions of our consumer-driven world by learning to function as a whole person from a state of inner completeness or being. The transition from an identity of having to being creates a state of enlightened psychological and spiritual happiness. Fromm observes that the modern person is less a self-reflective being than a composite of data promoted by the mass media, and he encourages us to pursue true self-awareness beyond simple political, ideological, and religious clich�s. By learning to be centered in the self, the individual is less swayed by the endless pressures and dissatisfactions of the culture of consumerism.</p><p>ERICH FROMM (1900-1980) was an outstanding social scientist and author of bestsellers. He was also a practising psychoanalyst who applied his experience to the interpretation of social phenomena and reformulated Freud&#39;s basic insights into the unconcious of the individual and of society. Fromm&#39;s popular success rests principally on two later works, The Art of Loving and To Have or to Be, in which he urged readers to abandon the lure of materialism for meaningful love."Eric Fromm is both a psychologist of penetration and a writer of ability." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>The Yacoubian Building: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>August Book Sense Pick</strong></p><p>A fading aristocrat and self-proclaimed &#x2018;scientist of women.&#x2019; A purring, voluptuous siren.

Picking up where the bestselling <b>The Liars' Club</b> left off, Karr dashes down the trail of her teen years with customary sass, only to run up against the paralyzing self-doubt of a girl in bloom. Fleeing the thrills and terrors of adolescence, she clashes against authority in all its forms and hooks up with an unforgettable band of heads and bona-fide geniuses. Parts of <b>Cherry</b> will leave you gasping with laughter. Karr assembles a self from the smokiest beginnings, delivering a long-awaited sequel that is both "bawdy and wise" <b>(<b>San Francisco Chronicle</b>)</b>.</p><p>As a girl idling her way through long, toxically boring summer afternoons in Leechfield, Texas, Mary Karr dreamed up an unusual career for herself, "to write one-half poetry and one-half autobiography." She has since done both, and even when she's recounting a dirty joke, she can't help but employ a poet's precise and musical vision. Her first memoir, <i>The Liar's Club</i>, was as searing a chronicle of family life as can be imagined--tough, funny, and crackling with sorrow and wit. Against all odds, its sequel doesn't disappoint. <i>Cherry</i> finds the teenage Mary still marooned in a family whose behavior ranges from charmingly eccentric to dangerously crazy. (This, for instance, is the Karr version of a note from home: "Lecia Karr's leprosy kicked in, and I had to wrap her limbs in balm and hyssop. Please excuse her.") But here the focus has shifted to Mary herself, furiously engaged in pissing off authority at every turn: flouting the dress code, dropping acid, running from the cops, falling in love. <p> First love, you may say, heart sinking in chest: what more can possibly be said about such a subject? Actually, a great deal. To read <i>Cherry</i> is to realize how rare it is to find a teenage girl portrayed on her own terms. As a chronicle of female adolescence with all its longings, fantasies, cruelties, and fears, Karr's memoir goes darker and deeper than any book in which the protagonist doesn't end up dead. She turns a savage eye on her own hypocrisies and failings, and we like her all the more for them. We even end up fond of Leechfield, easily the toughest, smelliest, nastiest little burg ever to appear between the covers of a book--"a town too ugly not to love," her father called it in <i>The Liar's Club</i>. Growing up in such a place is necessarily about getting the hell out, but it's also about inventing a new identity with which to make your escape. That's the blessing Karr's wise friend Meredith bestows after a particularly harrowing (and harrowingly funny) acid trip: "I see big adventures for Mary. Big adventures, long roads, great oceans: same self." <i>Cherry</i> is the story of how Karr begins to acquire that self, however fumblingly--a big adventure for Mary, as it is for all of us, and one we never finish as long as we live. Perhaps that's the book's greatest pleasure of all: it hints there's more to come. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Real Suffering</h2><p>Suffering is something that affects everyone.

He lives in Colorado with his wife, Debbie. They have three children.This book is a compilation of profiles of world religions written by scholars affiliated with the International Students, Inc., an evangelical Christian organization. It is a manual designed to arm proselytizing Christians in their attempt to confront Buddhists, Moslems, Hindus, Taoists, Jews, Marxists, and other faith believers with the inconsistencies of their faiths and to ring them into Christianity. The chapter on Judaism ends with a message to weary Christians: "Be encouraged that many Jewish believers in Jesus have come to faith through the loving witness of Gentle Christians." The message for those attempting to convert a Marxist has a simpler ending: "Love them. Pray for them. Encourage them to study God's word with you." This strong theological agenda eliminates this book as an objective source for facts concerning world religions. Even facts concerning Christianity are twisted until they fit the agenda or are ignored if they don't fit this organization's beliefs. Not recommended.?Glenn Masuchika, Chaminade Univ.

As a young ship's cook in 1847, Gregory prepared the standard breakfast of balls of fried sweet dough. The sailors called them "sinkers" because although the dough fried up crisp and sweet around the edges, "their raw centers, heavy with grease, made them drop like cannonballs in the stomach." Gregory had a better idea and shaped a new batch by cutting holes in the center of each sinker and then frying them in boiling lard. The doughnut was born. Although Hanson went on to become a ship's captain and was awarded a medal for heroism for his actions at sea, his legacy is his delicious creation. This book relates some of the many colorful legends that have surrounded the origins of this sweet treat over the years. The short, humorous text delivers facts that young children will appreciate, while keeping the interest of the more mature. Kirsch has admirably complemented the story with bright, cartoonlike illustrations that evoke the history and the humor of the tale. Clever "porthole," or "doughnut hole," borders frame each page. Whimsically, the artist has placed doughnuts throughout, from the endpapers, which include several varieties, to the back cover, which features an octopus holding a doughnut on each arm.

From those conversations stemmed this enlightened, affectionate book -- a mine of wonderful, surprising observations and information about editing, writing and literature, music and sound, the I-Ching, dreams, art and history.<br> <br> <i>The Conversations</i> is filled with stories about how some of the most important movies of the last thirty years were made and about the people who brought them to the screen. It traces the artistic growth of Murch, as well as his friends and contemporaries -- including directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Fred Zinneman and Anthony Minghella -- from the creation of the independent, anti-Hollywood Zoetrope by a handful of brilliant, bearded young men to the recent triumph of <i>Apocalypse Now Redux</i>.<br> <br> Among the films Murch has worked on are <i>American Graffiti</i>, <i>The Conversation</i>, the remake of <i>A Touch of Evil</i>, <i>Julia</i>, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, <i>The Godfather</i> (all three), <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, and <i>The English Patient</i>.<br> <br> <i>&#x201c;Walter Murch is a true oddity in Hollywood. A genuine intellectual and renaissance man who appears wise and private at the centre of various temporary storms to do with film making and his whole generation of filmmakers.

JOHN</b> (1919-1993) was a nurse, missionary and author. She earned a nursing degree at St. Thomas� Hospital in London in 1946. In the early 1950�s she moved to Tangier, Morocco where she served as a missionary nurse for 27 years. Throughout her life, she travelled extensively in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, as the settings of her novels reflect. In 1977, she returned to England, where she cared for elderly relatives and ministered from her home to youths, single parents, and the elderly. Patricia authored numerous books, including <i>Treasures of the Snow, The Tanglewoods� Secret, The Secret at Pheasant Cottage</i>, and <i>Star of Light</i>.</p><h2>God Speaks</h2><p>God Speaks is Meher Baba's most complete statement of the process of Creation and its purpose. This recent reprinting maintains the contents of the 1973 revised edition while presenting the material in a new style. A contemporary format makes the work attractive and easier to read for today's audiences. <p>God Speaks incorporates all of life into a spiritual saga. The only protagonist is God, and his story encompasses all individual biographies. It is God himself who becomes the three basic processes for the growth and transformation of consciousness: evolution, reincarnation and involution (the spiritual path of return to Himself). </p><p>The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness. </p><p>Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question. </p><p>The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in waterconversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air. </p><p>When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness. </p><p>So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people. </p><p>But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience. </p><p>Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward." </p><p>Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying "There are as many ways to God as there are souls...." </p><p>Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness. </p><p>The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness." </p><p>The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul. </p><p>Yet the saga is not necessarily over. Meher Baba indicates that even among God-realized souls responsibilities within Creation may differ. Most play no further active part in Creation. But a rare few make the journey back to human consciousness. Of these, five become Perfect Masters, blending divine consciousness with awareness of all beings in evolution, reincarnation and involution. These five administer the affairs of the universe. And they use their "infinite knowledge, power and bliss for the progressive emancipation of all in the field of illusion." </p><p>Meher Baba differentiates these Perfect Masters, who are always on earth, from the Avatar, who is the "that highest status of God, where God directly becomes man and lives on earth as God-man." He further comments that the "Avatar is always One and the same, the eternal, indivisible, infinite One who manifests Himself in the form of man as the Avatar, as the Messiah, as the Prophet, as the Buddha, as the Ancient Onethe Highest of the High." </p><p>A little over a year before the first publication of God Speaks, Meher Baba officially declared himself to be that Avatara claim that amplifies the meaning of the title. To the one who accepts Meher Baba's position, God's plan is revealed vividly through these pages.</p></p><p>Only a God-realized being has the knowledge, the depth and acuity of insight to author a book such as God Speaks on the purpose of Creation and the goal of life. Meher Baba was that rare one among perfect ones who appears whenever a world crisis is at its height and whose role is to set the world on a new direction in a new age. From February 25, 1894, until January 31, 1969, the Saviour of mankind again walked this earth. The Messiah, the Christ, the Avatar, the Buddha, the Rasool of God was again among us in human form as Meher Baba. This statement cannot be intellectually proved, nor is it made to establish a claim. The greatness and significance of Meher Baba can only be measured by the stretching of the inner self of those who are attracted by the impact of his life and teachings. <p>Throughout his lifetime, Meher Baba's headquarters were in western India, often near Poona or Ahmednagar. Although access and contact were difficult by Western standards (especially with the permanent residence of later years at Meherazad), this was not isolation. Long periods of seclusion alternated with extensive world travels. His contacts with notables and with the unknown were extensive. In a crowd, his dynamic nature drew all eyes toward him. His charm and appeal to all who came near him were universal. For his devotees, he changed every facet of their existence. They would rearrange their lives so that they could be with him on those rare occasions when he held darshan or sahavas. His silence, which he observed voluntarily since 1925, did not impair communication. "In the past, I have given you enough words," he said, "the time has now come to live them." Up until late 1954 he used a board with letters of the English alphabet mounted on it, to which he pointed. That is how he dictated this book. After 1954 he used hand gestures, where were read out by disciples. </p><p>Meher Baba did not come to establish a new religion. "There are enough of these," he said. He came to awaken us. The task for the individual is to live his religion in practice, by working on himself and by serving othersnot to convert or change others to match his own views. Throughout his life, Avatar Meher Baba was the living example of his motto "Mastery in Servitude." This is emblazoned on the tomb where his body now lies buried atop Meherabad Hill.</p>No other work has yet been published which takes the reader so deeply into the fundamental mechanics of life and the universe. God Speaks is a minutely detailed description of the journey of the soul from the time of its "creation" until it has completed its function in the evolution and involution of consciousness, and has returned to the Over-Soul from which it originated. <p>The flowering of each stage in the developmental pattern is described from several standpoints; and the characteristics and difficulties of certain key steps along the way are considered in detail. In reading God Speaks one has the sense of an unlimited breadth of viewpoint in which the teachings of all the great world religions are literally brought together "like beads on one string." The special knowledges of each are incorporated into a comprehensive description of the goal of Creation, and certain basic misunderstandings of the teachings of the Messengers of the ages are deftly corrected, so that a consistent, fundamental pattern of the origins and destiny of man emerges. </p><p>Students of philosophy and religion will find much material which is entirely new or which had previously been advanced only in very fragmentary form. With precision and lucidity Meher Baba clarifies and defines formerly diffuse concepts. Regarding evolution and consciousness, he says, "It is well to remember always that the beginning is a beginning in consciousness, the evolution is an evolution in consciousness, the end, if there be an end, is an end in consciousness." </p><p>On concluding the volume, one is left with the conviction that, regardless of the mechanism by which it may have been accomplished, truly the voice of God has been heard.</p></p><h2>Genesis Finding Our Roots</h2><p>This book provides a unique look at Genesis 1-11, integrating history with art, literature and other disciplines.

Its narrative of the persecution of Christians in seventeenth-century Japan raises uncomfortable questions about God and the ambiguity of faith in the midst of suffering and hostility. Endo's <em>Silence</em> took internationally renowned visual artist Makoto Fujimura on a pilgrimage of grappling with the nature of art, the significance of pain and his own cultural heritage. His artistic faith journey overlaps with Endo's as he uncovers deep layers of meaning in Japanese history and literature, expressed in art both past and present. He finds connections to how faith is lived in contemporary contexts of trauma and glimpses of how the gospel is conveyed in Christ-hidden cultures. In this world of pain and suffering, God often seems silent. Fujimura's reflections show that light is yet present in darkness, and that silence speaks with hidden beauty and truth.</p><p>Internationally renowned artist Makoto Fujimura serves as the director of Fuller Seminary's Brehm Center for Worship, Theology, and the Arts. He is also the founder of the International Arts Movement. His books include <em>Refractions</em> and <em>Culture Care</em>."Only Mako Fujimura could have written this book. It sheds light on a wealth of topics&#x2015;a classic novel, Japanese culture, Martin Scorsese's filmmaking, the fine arts, theology, the enigmas of East and West&#x2015;and leaves the reader with a startlingly new encounter with Christ." (Philip Yancey)<br><br>"Fujimura . . . unearths universal implications about faith, suffering, and art in this focused literary study of one novel, Shusaku Endo's <em>Silence</em>. . . . Fujimura analyzes Japan?s fumi-e culture, calling it 'a culture of lament,' and asserts that 'faith can include our failures, even multiple failures.' Stories of historical figures on which Endo based <em>Silence</em>, scriptural analysis, and a wide range of literary and artistic references from both Japanese and Western culture (including Martin Scorsese?s 2016 film adaptation of <em>Silence</em>) add rich, refracted layers to this carefully crafted, masterful book." (Publishers Weekly STARRED REVIEW, March 11, 2016)<br><br>"Makoto Fujimura is a remarkable artist and writer, and his engagement with the writings of the great Shusaku Endo&#x2015;and <em>Silence</em> in particular&#x2015;is deep and impassioned, as you will discover on every page of this book. By way of response to a great artist, Fujimura has created a quietly eloquent meditation on art and faith, and where they converge." (Martin Scorsese, director of Gangs of New York, The Wolf of Wall Street, and Silence)<br><br>"My friend Mako Fujimura is one of the most thoughtful, sensitive and eloquent artists of this generation. Like his otherworldly and luminous paintings, his book <em>Silence and Beauty</em> is at once glorious and profound, an exquisite exploration of truth and beauty, silence and suffering. Give yourself and others the immeasurable gift of this gentle, inspiring treasure." (Eric Metaxas, New York Times bestselling author of Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy)<br><br>"Makoto Fujimura's <em>Silence and Beauty</em> (IVP, 2016) artfully probes Shusaku Endo's famous novel <em>Silence</em>, and in doing so shows how God's truth bores through silence and darkness." (Marvin Olasky, WORLD, April 16, 2016)<br><br>"Fujimura's book is a brilliant blend of investigation and reflection. The reader learns about the compelling history of Christianity in Japan and its strangely enduring influence there, while at the same time being led into a profound meditation on the relation of Christian faith to contemporary culture. A truly impressive achievement." (Gordon Graham, Henry Luce III Professor of Philosophy and the Arts, Princeton Theological Seminary, author of The Re-enchantment of the World)<br><br>"How can we live in a world where we encounter suffering every day? Where is the voice of God when we doubt his goodness? It takes a very specific perspective to write beautiful prose about these questions, but in this book, Mako does just that&#x2015;exploring the themes raised by Endo's novel and their continuing resonance across our difficult, anxious times. <em>Silence and Beauty</em> is a gift for us as we try to be the fragrance of Christ in a suffering world." (Alissa Wilkinson, chief film critic, Christianity Today, assistant professor of English and humanities, The King's College)<br><br>"Fujimura's <em>Silence and Beauty</em> is a truly remarkable spiritual, theological and intellectual autobiography for our time. It will be of interest to a broad readership, not least of all those who still hear the disorienting and potentially transformational call to intercultural mission in the way of Jesus. Fujimura's musings on the Christ-hidden culture of Japan, his own story and contemporary culture are revelatory, and his layering of the Ground Zero theme functions like a Rembrandt primer out of which a sublime beauty and grace emerges." (Thomas John Hastings, research fellow, Kagawa Archives and Resource Center, former professor of practical theology, Tokyo Union Theological Seminary)<br><br>"When I read Shusaku Endo's <em>Silence</em> for the first time, I vowed that I would refuse to ever read anything written about it. I wanted to preserve the profound sense of mystery and beauty that the novel evoked in me. I am so happy now that I broke that vow by reading this wonderful book by Makoto Fujimura. Mako not only enhances and deepens the sense of mystery, but&#x2015;as he has done so consistently in his visual works of art&#x2015;he adds significantly to the beauty!" (Richard Mouw, president emeritus, professor of faith and public life, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Mako Fujimura offers us a moving and illuminating series of reflections on one of the most powerful novels ever written. He helps us to understand how Endo's tale of martyrdom lives in the tensions between East and West, faith and doubt, trust and betrayal. Above all, Fujimura enables us to sense that grace can live&#x2015;and inspire new life&#x2015;even in the midst of suffering."

The story has been told over and over by liars and it must be retold. Do not struggle when the hook of a word pulls you into the air of truth and you cannot breathe.</p> <p>For a little while, I ask this of you.</p> <p>Come with me.</p> <p>Once Upon a Time</p> <p>&#x201c;<b>Y</b>ou&#x2019;ve no choice. Look back.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The man looked over his shoulder and saw the lights of another motorcycle&#x2014;two&#x2014;no&#x2014;three motorcycles following them. He couldn&#x2019;t go faster on the dirt road. The ruts were frozen and the machine would tip into a ditch. The dark forest imprisoned the road. He could smell snow coming.</p> <p>The children in the sidecar stared into the night, eyes slitted against the wind. The girl&#x2019;s hair wrapped around her head like a scarf and was the only covering that protected her thin throat. The boy was rolled low into the metal egg, his curly head dark in the moonlight, so thin he took almost no space at all.</p> <p>The woman squeezed the man&#x2019;s sides until he grunted.</p> <p>It was unfair. He adapted. He became like everyone else. College in France. Work as an engineer. New knowledge for new times and new people. Rejecting the sidelocks of his father. Leaving the study of dead laws and old men swaying in the temple. His friends had been Christian Poles, and none of them had been religious either.</p> <p>But the world of intellectual talk and scientific study exploded. He fled from western Poland not in an airplane, defying the old laws of gravity, but crawling along in a peasant&#x2019;s cart pulled by a spavined horse bought with all the silver spoons his wife owned.</p> <p>Her silver had protected them from being in the city when the Nazis arrived, but it did not protect them from the bombs. He buried his wife beside the road after the strafing, when she lay with her beautiful torso facing the sky, dress torn, nipples like dead eyes, unblinking.</p> <p>A quick learner, he survived the Russians by being a mechanic for them. He survived the Bialystok ghetto by being a mechanic for the Nazis. He had remarried this woman who now clutched his sides until he couldn&#x2019;t breathe. He had gotten all of them out of the ghetto before the August deportations, hiding the children in tires strapped to the back of a truck, cutting their stepmother&#x2019;s hair and giving her men&#x2019;s clothes, passing through the barbed-wire fences as mechanics and hiding in a grease pit. Knowing that the trains were loading the other Jews. Hearing the screams and shots all night. Hearing them when he was awake. Hearing them in his dreams when he slept. He would not look over his shoulder again. The pursuing Nazis would be closer and he couldn&#x2019;t bear much more.</p> <p>&#x201c;Your children will be dead if they catch us.&#x201d; The woman clung tighter. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll shoot us beside the road.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He howled it, the shouted word giving him back for a moment his life that was lost in the whispering years of submission and hiding. &#x201c;Someone could take pity on them. The girl is eleven, old enough to be useful. They may have luck.&#x201d;</p> <p>The girl in the sidecar looked back, her bony shoulder rising, blue eyes almost white in the moonlight. Three lights. It was almost over. She wrapped her arm tighter around her seven-year-old brother. She saw his throat move and knew what he was doing. She had taught him how.</p> <p>He had saved his spit for over an hour. She had told him to think of biting into a lemon to make the spit flow, but he couldn&#x2019;t remember lemons. He thought of vinegar. His spit spurted and he had extra juice at the end of the swallow. A mouthful of spit swallowed slowly was almost like drinking soup. Hot soup with potatoes mashed in it. He felt his stomach contract and willed it to stop aching.</p> <p>&#x201c;We have to hide the motorcycle and run into the forest.&#x201d; The woman would not shut up.</p> <p>&#x201c;With the children,&#x201d; the father shouted.</p> <p>The boy listened. The Stepmother would get her way. She wasn&#x2019;t their real mother.</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll bring dogs. The children will slow us. Leave the children, and we&#x2019;ll all have a chance.&#x201d;</p> <p>The father hated her with such a surge of his blood that he almost stopped the motorcycle so he could choke her. Beat her. He clung to the anger as long as he could because it squeezed the truth out, but the feeling seeped away and he concentrated on the road. He needed a curve, a hill, something to block the view so he could put the children down.</p> <p>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t deep enough,&#x201d; he said of the first curve. When he didn&#x2019;t slow for the third, she gripped his sides again and howled like a dog.</p> <p>The father braked on the fourth curve and leapt off. He grabbed the girl and wrenched her from the sidecar. The boy staggered when he was set on the road.</p> <p>&#x201c;Go,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Go into the woods. Run.&#x201d;</p> <p>The woman sat with her head down, but she called out to them. &#x201c;Hide until the other motorcycles are past. Then find someone. Find a farmer who will feed you.&#x201d;</p> <p>The girl shook her head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll report us. If they don&#x2019;t, the Nazis will kill them.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her stepmother looked back. She had to end it.</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look Jewish. You&#x2019;re blond. Your brother&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped and stared behind at the machines coming toward them. What was, was. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let him take his pants down in front of anyone. They&#x2019;ll see he&#x2019;s circumcised. Do you hear me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Our names?&#x201d; The girl clung to the sidecar.</p> <p>&#x201c;Never say them. You don&#x2019;t have Jewish names anymore.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who are we?&#x201d; The boy smiled. It was interesting. He wouldn&#x2019;t be himself.</p> <p>&#x201c;Any name. Any name that&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d; the stepmother paused and she couldn&#x2019;t think of Polish names. Her mind was blank. She knew it was hunger. Six hundred calories a day for two years&#x2014;on the good days, on the days when there was something left to sell. Sometimes she went blank.</p> <p>The boy took his sister&#x2019;s hand and moved toward the woods. &#x201c;Who are we?&#x201d; he called back.</p> <p>The Stepmother moaned and slapped her face viciously. The man got on the motorcycle and they moved off slowly so the wheels wouldn&#x2019;t catch in the ruts.</p> <p>Slamming her fist against her head, their Stepmother shook loose an old memory.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hansel and Gretel,&#x201d; she screamed over her shoulder at the children who were now almost hidden in the trees. &#x201c;You are Hansel and Gretel. Remember.&#x201d;</p> <p>The man couldn&#x2019;t look back. He gunned the engine and moved away from that place. The two adults had become the lure that would lead the hunters away from the children. The gas would last for another ten miles. Their motorcycle could stay ahead with the weight of the children gone. The Nazis mustn&#x2019;t know that anyone had been left behind.</p> <p>Hansel and Gretel</p> <p><b>T</b>he children stood near the trees and looked after their father and stepmother until the three motorcycles following droned louder.</p> <p>&#x201c;Quick.&#x201d; The girl helped her brother climb over a log and push through the piles of crackling leaves.</p> <p>They moved back into the darkness between the trees. The boy stared up and saw only a few stars. Clouds obscured the moon, and as the two children staggered through the deep layers of leaves, stiff-legged from being folded into the sidecar, they heard an owl call nearly over their heads. The boy almost cried out, but remembered the need to be silent, and bit his lip so hard it left a half-moon line of red when he unfastened his teeth.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lie down.&#x201d; His sister pushed him into the leaves and lay beside him.</p> <p>Their voices would not have been heard over the roar of the motorcycles that came slowly but steadily down the rutted road. One in front. Two behind in perfect formation. Precision even at midnight on a dirt road while chasing subhumans in eastern Poland.</p> <p>The boy lifted his head above the leaves and watched. He stared admiringly at the clean uniforms, the smooth metal bowl of helmet. The three motorcycles swept past, and the child marked down in his mind the way the Nazis sat perfectly straight and weren&#x2019;t afraid of being seen.</p> <p>The noise of the engines grew fainter until there was complete silence. The girl felt panic rising. The silence was unlike the constant moaning and screams in the ghetto. Too many people in such little space. Always someone dying or losing their last rag of dignity and howling for food or fighting or weeping. It had never been silent for so much as a second.</p> <p>She felt the tears run down her cheeks, and her brother watched her with interest.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re crying?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t see us. I was quiet.&#x201d;</p> <p>She nodded. &#x201c;You were good&#x2014;&#x201d; She paused. The new name. It took a moment. &#x201c;Hansel.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Gretel.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;m Gretel.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Gretel is a girl&#x2019;s name.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;m Hansel.&#x201d; He smiled. He was not himself anymore. He was not the little Jew who hid in the grease pit. He wondered if he could change his stomach to a stomach full of food. He tried to imagine it but couldn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t lie here. They could come back. They could have dogs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait a minute, Gretel.&#x201d;</p> <p>She didn&#x2019;t flinch when she heard her new name, but her lips quivered for a second. She felt herself wanting to relax so she could cry again, but there wasn&#x2019;t time. &#x201c;Come on.&#x201d;</p> <p>He followed her back into deeper darkness, walking with one bony fist smaller than a windfall apple pushed deep into his gut to stop the pain. The brush was thinning, and the enormous height of the trees rose over their heads in a canopy which allowed only moss and low plants to grow underneath.</p> <p>They had gone only a few steps when he stopped, holding her back like an anchor. She turned and waited. She knew his nature. It was impossible to move him until he was ready.</p> <p>He was making a great decision. He had some in his pocket, but it would mean breaking the most sacred law. You never touched the last piece of bread until everything had been done. The swallowing of spit. The fist in the gut. Forcing yourself to feel the stomach pain as if it belonged to someone else standing beside you. Father had taught him how to do these things.</p> <p>Only when the pain gave up could you touch the last piece of bread. Gretel said it was the law. You had to eat it slowly, not gobble it. It was how they did it. He didn&#x2019;t know why.</p> <p>He took the piece of bread out and measured it with his eyes. His father had stolen it from a pile that had been forgotten in the burning and killing. Like all the ghetto bread, there was a dark mark where the metal rods that pressed into the bread while it baked left lines. There had to be lines on the bread so it could be divided evenly.</p> <p>Both children leaned toward the bread until their noses almost touched the hard lump. They stared at it with the gaze of connoisseurs. It was slightly larger than the piece that Hansel usually managed to save.</p> <p>He looked at Gretel appraisingly. She might forbid it, but it was his right. No one could take it from you. Even if they were sick or starving or hungrier than you. The Stepmother had taught them. Your bread was your bread.</p> <p>He pinched off a tiny piece and deliberately let his fingers open so the bread fell to the leaves under their feet.</p> <p>Gretel&#x2019;s eyes widened. The hunger tore through her, and her hand twitched but she did not grab the bread from Hansel. He picked off another piece and threw it back toward the road.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Her mouth grew wetter as she thought of going back, finding the breadcrumb, holding it in her mouth.</p> <p>&#x201c;If we leave bread, they can find us. Later.&#x201d; He began walking into the dark and every ten steps he dropped another crumb.</p> <p>&#x201c;The leaves will cover it up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Stepmother can find a crumb on the street, in the middle of bodies thrown out in the morning. She&#x2019;ll smell it.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gretel nodded. The Stepmother always found cr...</p></p><h2>Fly High, Fly Low (50th Anniversary ed.)</h2><p><b>A Caldecott Honor book from the highly acclaimed author and illustrator of Corduroy!</b><br><br>Sid the pigeon is very choosy about finding just the right home in the magnificent city of san Francisco. And find it he does, in the loop of a huge b in an electric sign high up on a skyscraper. Sid's view of San Francisco is without equal. So Sid asks the lovely dove Midge to share his home. But one morning, while Midge is taking her turn sitting on two eggs, disaster strikes. A truck comes and workers take down the letters on the skyscraper one by one.&nbsp;<br><br>Winner of a Caldecott Honor, <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i> is a heartwarming story of two birds making a home--and then making another one--in one of America's great cities.</p><p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low.</p><h2>Champions of the Force (Star Wars: The Jedi Academy Trilogy, Vol. 3)</h2><p>Suspended helplessly between life and death, Luke Skywalker lies in state at the Jedi academy.

Today it is much more than that; it&#x2019;s a central plaza, a cultural center, a walkway, and a green retreat in a bustling city that is free for all to enjoy. But above all else, it is a beautiful, dynamic garden with plantings designed by Piet Oudolf, one of the world&#x2019;s most extraordinary garden designers.&nbsp;<em>Gardens of the High Line</em>, by Piet Oudolf and Rick Darke, offers an in-depth view into the planting designs, plant palette, and maintenance of this landmark achievement. It reveals a four-season garden that is filled with native and exotic plants, drought-tol�erant perennials, and grasses that thrive and spread. It also offers inspiration and advice to home gardeners and garden designers looking to recreate its iconic, naturalistic style.&nbsp;Featuring stunning photographs by Rick Darke and an introduction&nbsp;by Robert Hammond, the founder of the Friends of the High Line, this large-trim, photo-driven book is a must-have for anyone who appreciates&nbsp;the nature of&nbsp;design.</p><p>We are both pleased to be collaborating with our friend and colleague graphic designer Lorraine Ferguson and Friends of the High Line to produce a book exclusively devoted to the High Line&#39;s gardens.Piet Oudolf is among the world's most innovative garden designers and a leading exponent of naturalistic planting, a style that takes inspiration from nature but employs artistic skill in creating planting schemes.

In the century-and-a-half since Charles Baudelaire, Emma Lazarus, Oscar Wilde and Ivan Turgenev spread the notion of a new kind of poetry, this "genre with an oxymoron for a name" has attracted many of our most beloved writers. Yet, even now, this peculiarly rich and expansive form is still misunderstood and overlooked. Here, Jeremy Noel-Tod reconstructs the history of the prose poem for us by selecting the essential pieces of writing, covering a greater chronological sweep and international range than any previous anthology of its kind. Noel-Tod even calls it "an alternative history of modern poetry." In <i>The Penguin Book of the Prose Poem</i>, Patricia Lockwood and Claudia Rankine rub shoulders with Margaret Atwood and Adrienne Rich; Allen Ginsberg and Gertrude Stein appear with Lu Xun and Jorge Luis; Czeslaw Milosz sits just pages from Eileen Myles.</p></p><p><b>Jeremy Noel-Tod</b> is a lecturer in the School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. His literary criticism has been widely published, in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, the <i>Literary Review</i>, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, <i>Prospect</i>, the <i>New Statesman</i>, the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>London Review of Books</i>, and he has been the poetry critic for the <i>Sunday Times</i> since 2013.<i> </i>His books as an editor include the revised edition of the <i>Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry</i> (2013) and the <i>Complete Poems</i> of R.

Your family&#x2019;s lives?</strong></p><p>To many Christians in the Middle East today, a &#x201c;momentary, light affliction&#x201d; means enduring only torture instead of martyrdom. The depth of oppression Jesus followers suffer is unimaginable to most Western Christians. Yet, it is an everyday reality for those who choose faith over survival in Syria, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, and other countries hostile to the Gospel of Christ. In&nbsp;<em>Killing Christians,&nbsp;</em>Tom Doyle takes readers to the secret meetings, the torture rooms, the grim prisons, and even the executions that are the &#x201c;calling&#x201d; of countless Muslims-turned-Christians.</p><p>Each survivor longs to share with brothers and sisters &#x201c;on the outside&#x201d; what Christ has taught them.&nbsp;<em>Killing Christians&nbsp;</em>is their message to readers who still enjoy freedom to practice their faith. None would wish their pain and suffering on those who do not have to brave such misery, but the richness gained through their remarkable trials are delivered&#x2014;often in their own words&#x2014;through this book.

Beside her was JinJing, a sweet woman, unaware that the man she worked for was an infamous criminal or that the woman beside her was no more Chinese than the man on the moon. Bellisia's hair was long and straight, a waterfall of silk reaching to her waist. She was short, delicate-looking, with small feet and hands. She spoke flawlessly in the dialect JinJing spoke, laughing and gossiping companionably in the restroom during their short break.<br><br> She kept her heart rate absolutely steady, the beat never rising in spite of the fact that she knew just by the heightened security and the tenseness of the guards that what she'd been looking for this past week was finally here. It was a good thing too. Time was running out fast. Like most of the technicians in the laboratory, she didn't wear a watch, but she was very aware of the days and hours ticking by.<br><br> JinJing waved to her and hurried out as the chime sounded, the call back to work. Anyone caught walking the halls was instantly let go. Or at least they disappeared. Rumor had it that wherever they were taken was not pleasant. The Cheng Company paid well. Bernard Lee Cheng had many businesses and employed a good number of people, but he was a very exacting boss.<br><br> Bellisia couldn't wait any longer. She couldn't be caught in the restroom either. Very carefully she removed the long wig and lifelike skin of her mask and rolled them into her white lab coat. She slipped off the laboratory uniform, revealing the skintight one-piece bodysuit she wore under it-one that reflected the background around her. Her shoes were crepe-soled and easy to move fast in. She removed them and shoved them in one of the pockets. Her pale blond hair was braided in a tight weave. She was as ready as she'd ever be. She slipped out, back into the narrow hallway the moment she knew it was empty. Acute hearing ensured she knew exactly where most of the technicians were on the floor. She knew the precise location of every camera and just how to avoid them.<br><br> Once in the hall, she climbed up the wall to the ceiling, blending in with the dingy, off-white color that looked like it had seen better days. As she moved from the hallway of the laboratory to the offices the wall color changed to a muted blue, fresh and crisp. She changed color until she was perfectly blending in and slowed her pace. Movement drew the eye, and there were far more people in the offices. Most of them were in small, open cubicles, but as she continued through to the next large bank of offices, the walls changed to a muted green in the one large office that mattered to her.<br><br> She could see the woman seated, facing away from her, looking at the man behind the desk. Bernard Lee Cheng. She was very tempted to kill him, take the opportunity of being so close and just get the job done. It would rid the world of a very evil man, but it wasn't her mission, no matter how much she wished it were. The woman, Senator Violet Smythe-Freeman-now just Smythe-was her mission, specifically to see if the senator was selling out her country and fellow GhostWalkers, the teams of soldiers few even knew existed.<br><br> There was no way into the office, but that didn't matter. She moved slowly across the ceiling, hiding in plain sight. Even if one of the men or women on the floor happened to look up they would have a difficult time spotting her as long as she was careful to move like a sloth, inching her way to her destination. She positioned herself outside the office over the door. Muting the sounds around her, she concentrated on the voices coming from inside the office.<br><br> Cheng faced her. Even if she couldn't hear his every word because he'd soundproofed his office, she could read lips. He wanted the GhostWalker program. Files. Everything-including soldiers to take apart. Her stomach clenched. Violet's voice was pitched low. She had the ability to persuade people to do what she wanted with her voice, but Cheng seemed immune.<br><br> She wanted money for her campaign. Maurice Stuart had named her his running mate for the presidential election. If elected, she planned to have Stuart assassinated so that she would become president. Cheng would have an ally in the White House. It was a simple enough business deal. The origins of dark money never had to be exposed. No one would know.<br><br> Violet was beautiful and intelligent. She was poisonous. A sociopath. She was also enhanced, one of the original girls Dr. Whitney had found in orphanages and experimented on so that he could enhance his soldiers without harming them. She used her looks and her voice to get the things she wanted. More than anything, she wanted power.<br><br> Cheng nodded his head and leaned forward, his eyes sharp, his face a mask. He repeated the price. Files. GhostWalkers.<br><br> Bellisia remained still as Violet sold out her country and fellow soldiers. She told him where to find a team and how to get to them. She also told him there were copies of the files he wanted in several places, but most were too difficult to get to. The one place he had the best chance was in Louisiana, at the Stennis Center.<br><br> Cheng responded adamantly, insisting she get the files for him. She was just as adamant that she couldn't. He asked her why she was so against the GhostWalker program.<br><br> Bellisia tried to get closer, as if that would help her hear better. She wanted to know as well. Violet was one of them. One of the original orphans Peter Whitney had used for his own purposes-a "sister," not by blood but certainly in every other way. She'd undergone the same experiments with enhancing psychic abilities. With genetics, changing DNA. There was no doubt that Whitney was a genius, but he was also certifiably insane.<br><br> Violet's murmured response horrified Bellisia. The woman was a GhostWalker snob. Superior soldiers were fine. DNA of animals was fine. Enhancement met with her approval, but not when it came to the latest experiments coming to light-the use of vipers and spiders. That was going too far and cheapened the rest of them. She wanted anyone with that kind of DNA wiped out.<br><br> There was a moment of silence as if Cheng was turning her sudden burst of venomous hatred over and over in his mind, just as Bellisia was. Bellisia could have warned Violet that she was skating close to danger. Violet was a GhostWalker. Few had that information, but with that one outburst, she'd made a shrewd, extremely intelligent man wonder about her. He had a GhostWalker right there in his laboratory.<br><br> Violet, seemingly unaware of the danger, or because of it, swiftly moved on, laying out her demands once again. The two went back to haggling. In the end, Violet began to rise, and Cheng lifted a hand to stop her. She sank down gracefully, and the deal was made. Bellisia listened to another twenty minutes of conversation while the two hashed out what each would do for the other.<br><br> Bellisia calculated the odds of escaping if she killed the senator as the traitor emerged from Cheng's office. They weren't good. Even so, she still entertained the idea. The level of the woman's treachery was beyond imagination. She despised Violet.<br><br> A stir in the office drew her attention. Guards marched in and directed those in the smaller offices out. She glanced into the hallway and saw that the entire floor was being cleared. Her heart accelerated before she could stop it. She took a slow breath and steadied her pulse just as the siren went off, calling everyone, from the labs to the offices, into the large dorm areas.<br><br> Lockdown. She couldn't get to the restroom to retrieve her uniform, lab coat and wig before the soldiers searched, nor did she have enough time remaining before the virus injected into her began to kill her. She also couldn't remain in one of Cheng's endless lockdowns. He was paranoid enough that he had kept workers on the premises for over a week more than once. She'd be dead without the antidote by that time. Cheng would be even tighter with his security once the clothes and wig were discovered.<br><br> She began the slow process necessary to make her way across the ceiling to the hall. She couldn't go down to the main floor. Soldiers were pouring in and every floor would be flooded by now. She had to go up to the only sanctuary she might be able to get to. There were tanks of water housed on the roof that fed the sprinkler systems. That was her only way to stay safe from the searches Cheng would conduct once her clothes were found. That meant she had to take the elevator.<br><br> Cursing mentally in every language she was fluent in-and that was quite a few-she hovered just above the elevator doors. The soldiers would go into the elevator and that meant she had to be very close to them. The men were already on alert and gathering in front of the elevator. The slightest mistake would cost her. Although she could blend into her environment, it took a few seconds for her skin and hair to change. Her clothing would mirror her surroundings, so she would have the look of the elevator over her body but her head and hands and feet would be exposed for that couple of seconds.<br><br> Heart pounding, she slowly edged over to the very top of the elevator. Should she try to start blending into that color now, or wait until she was inside with a dozen guards and guns? She had choices, but the wrong one would end her life. Changing colors to mirror her background was more like the octopus than the chameleon, but it still took a few precious moments. She began changing, concentrating on her hands and feet first until she appeared part of the doors. <br><br> A ping signaled that she only had seconds to get inside and up the wall to the ceiling of the elevator. She waited until soldiers stepped into the elevator and slipped inside with them, clinging to the wall over their heads. The door nearly closed on her foot before she could pull it in. The men crowded in, and there was little space. She felt as if she couldn't breathe. The car didn't have high ceilings, so they were mashed together and the taller ones nearly brushed against her body. Twice, the hair of the man closest to her-and it was just her bad luck that he was tall-actually did brush against her face, tickling her skin.<br><br> She rode floor to floor as men got off to sweep each, making certain that all personnel did as the siren demanded and went immediately to the dormitory where they would be searched.<br><br> The last of the soldiers went to the roof. She knew this would be her biggest danger point. She had to exit the elevator right behind the last soldier. It was imperative that all of them were looking outward and not back toward the closing doors. She was a mimic, a chameleon, and no one would be able to see her, but once again it would take precious seconds to complete the change in a new environment.<br><br> She crawled down to the floor and eased out behind the last man, her gaze sweeping the roof to find the water tanks. There were six banks of them, each feeding the sprinklers on several floors. She stayed very still, right up against the wall until her skin and hair adjusted fully to the new background. Only then did she begin her slow crawl across the roof, making for the nearest tank while the soldiers spread out and swept the large space.<br><br> Up so high the wind was a menace, blowing hard and continuously at the men. They stumbled as it hit them in gusts. She stayed low to the ground, almost on her belly. She stopped once when one of the soldiers cursed in a mixture of Mandarin and Shanghainese. He cursed the weather, not Cheng. No one would dare curse Cheng, afraid it would get back to him.<br><br> Cheng considered himself a businessman. He'd inherited his empire and his intellect from his Chinese father and his good looks and charm from his American movie star mother. Both parents had opened doors for him, in China as well as the United States. He had expanded those doors to nearly every country in the world. He'd doubled his father's empire, making him one of the wealthiest men on the planet, but he'd done so by providing to terrorists, rebels and governments classified information, weapons and anything else they needed. He sold secrets to the highest bidder, and no one ever touched him.<br><br> Bellisia didn't understand what it was that drove people to do the terrible things they did. Greed. Power. She knew she didn't live the way others did, but she didn't see that the outside world was any better than her world. Maybe worse. Hers was one of discipline and service. It wasn't always comfortable and she couldn't trust very many people, but then outside her world, the majority didn't seem to have it much better.<br><br> The cursing soldier stopped just before he tripped over her. She actually felt the brush of the leather of his boot. Bellisia eased her body away from him. Holding her breath. Keeping her movements infinitely slow. She inched her way across the roof, the movements so controlled her muscles cramped in protest. It hurt to move that slowly. All the while her heart pounded and she had to work to keep her breathing steady and calm.<br><br> She was right under their noses. All they had to do was look down and see her, if they could penetrate her disguise. She watched them carefully, looking out of the corners of her eyes, listening for them as well, but all the while measuring the distance to the water tanks. It seemed to take forever until she reached the base of the nearest one. Forever.<br><br> She reached a hand up and slid her fingers forward using the setae on the tips of her fingers to stick. Setae-single microscopic hairs split into hundreds of tiny bristles-were so tiny they were impossible to see, so tiny Dr. Whitney hadn't realized she actually had them, in spite of his enhancements. Pushing the setae onto the surface and dragging them forward allowed her to stick to the surface easily. Each seta could hold enormous amounts of weight, so having them on the pads of her fingers and toes allowed her to climb or hang upside down on a ceiling easily. The larger the creature, the smaller the setae, and no seta had ever been recorded that was small enough to hold a human being-until Dr. Whitney had managed unwittingly to create one.</p><h2>Christopher&#39;s Garden</h2><p><p>Christopher often plays on his own in his garden -- until one day, he discovers a whole new world!

Now 27, she is the unmarried mother of three and is raising her kids in one of Philadelphia's poorest neighborhoods. Would she and her children be better off if she had waited to have them and had married their father first? Why do so many poor American youth like Millie continue to have children before they can afford to take care of them? <br><br>Over a span of five years, sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas talked in-depth with 162 low-income single moms like Millie to learn how they think about marriage and family. <i>Promises I Can Keep </i>offers an intimate look at what marriage and motherhood mean to these women and provides the most extensive on-the-ground study to date of why they put children before marriage despite the daunting challenges they know lie ahead.</p><p>"This is the most important study ever written on motherhood and marriage among low-income urban women. Edin and Kefalas's timely, engaging, and well-written book is a careful ethnographic study that paints an indelible portrait of family life in poor communities and, in the process, provides incredible insights on the explosion of mother-only families within these communities."&#x2015;William Julius Wilson, author of <i>The Bridge over the Racial Divide</i><br><br>"This book provides the most insightful and comprehensive account I have read of the reasons why many low-income women postpone marriage but don't postpone childbearing.

Despite Bowen theory being based on research begun more than seventy years ago, the value of viewing human beings as profoundly emotionally-driven creatures and human families functioning as emotional units is more relevant than ever. This book, written by one of his closest collaborators, updates his still-radical theory with the latest approaches to understanding emotional development.</p><p>Reduced to its most fundamental level, Bowen theory explains how people begin a relationship very close emotionally but become more distant over time. The ideas also help explain why good people do bad things, and bad people do good things, and how family life strengthens some members while weakening others. Gaining knowledge about previously unseen specifics of family interactions reveals a hidden life of families. The hidden life explains how the best of intentions can fail to produce the desired result, thus providing a blueprint for change.&nbsp;</p><p>Part I of the book explains the core ideas in the theory. Part II describes the process of differentiation of self, which is the most important application of Bowen theory. People sometimes think of theories as "ivory tower" productions: interesting, but not necessarily practical. Differentiation of self is anything but; it has a well-tested real-world application. Part II includes four long case presentations of families in the public eye. They help illustrate how Bowen theory can help explain how families&#x2015;three of which appear fairly normal and one which does not&#x2015;unwittingly produce an offspring that chronically manifests some time of severely aberrant behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the book proposes a new "unidisease" concept&#x2015;the idea that a wide range of diseases have a number of physiological processes in common. In an Epilogue, Kerr applies Bowen theory to his family to illustrate how changes in a family relationship system over time can better explain the clinical course of a chronic illness than the diagnosis itself.&nbsp;</p><p>With close to four thousand hours of therapy conducted with about thirty-five hundred families over decades, Michael Kerr is an expert guide to the ins and outs of this most influential way of approaching clinical work with families.</p></p><p>Michael E. Kerr, MD, succeeded Murray Bowen as director of the Georgetown Family Center. He is coauthor with Bowen of Family Evaluation (Norton) and lives in Islesboro, Maine.&#x201c;As with Bateson's fireside chats, Bowen's coaching of the first generation of family therapists resonated beyond his day, and Kerr is revealing what that meant to a generation that may not have heard of them. Welcome back.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Metapsychology Online Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book is nothing less than a 21st-century masterpiece of Bowen theory and therapy. Only Michael Kerr could have written this update and expansion of the classic Bowen model. A striking bonus is Kerr's insightful and courageous sharing of his own family of origin journey. Bowen would be proud.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>William J. Doherty, PhD, Professor of Family Social Science at the University of Minnesota, co-author of <em>Helping Couples on the Brink of Divorce</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In his new text,&nbsp;<em>Bowen Theory&#x2019;s Secrets</em>,&nbsp;Michael Kerr does a masterful job of presenting his latest understanding and refinement of Bowen theory. Dr. Kerr applies its principles to clinical narratives, personal systems work and current psychological and sociological situations. Anyone with more than a passing interest in the work of Kerr and Bowen must have this book for study and enlightenment. It will inspire the on-going systems creativity of the next generation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Philip J. Geurin, MD, Founding Director of the Center for Family Learning, Rye Brook, NY</strong><br><br>&#x201c;When clinicians in the psychiatric ward such as Murray Bowen and Michael Kerr worry about the theoretical underpinnings of their craft, consider it legitimate to contemplate animal societies and trees in the forest, and are capable of reaching out to toolkits such as systems theory, there is hope yet for the emotionally troubled&nbsp;<em>Homo sapiens</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Raghavendra Gadagkar, author <em>Survival Strategies</em>, Founder and President of the Indian Society of Evolutionary Biologists</strong><br><br>&#x201c;How does one move from thinking that locates problems in the individual to a view of the family as an emotional system that governs the development of strengths and symptoms in its members? Dr. Kerr present clear, compelling evidence that supports the systems theory of family functioning developed by Murray Bowen. Invaluable to students of Bowen theory and accessible to people who have never heard of the theory, this book deserves a wide reading.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Randall Frost, Director of Training and Research, Living Systems, Vancouver, Canada</strong></p><h2>Fearless Girls, Wise Women &amp; Beloved Sisters: Heroines in Folktales from Around the World</h2><p><p><strong>One hundred great folk tales and fairy tales from all over the world about strong, smart, brave heroines.</strong></p><p>Dismayed by the predominance of male protagonists in her daughters' books, Kathleen Ragan set out to collect the stories of our forgotten heroines. Gathered from around the world, from regions as diverse as sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe, from North and South American Indian cultures and New World settlers, from Asia and the Middle East, these 100 folktales celebrate strong female heroines.</p><p><em>Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters</em> is for all women who are searching to define who they are, to redefine the world and shape their collective sensibility. It is for men who want to know more about what it means to be a woman. It is for our daughters and our sons, so that they can learn to value all kinds of courage, courage in battle and the courage of love. It is for all of us to help build a more just vision of woman.</p></p><p>Kathleen Ragan is the author of Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters and Outfoxing Fear. She has lived in or traveled to fifty countries and currently lives in Australia.Troubled by the scarcity of female protagonists of any kind in children's books, let alone strong, smart, and resourceful heroines, Ragan transformed her search for good stories to read to her young daughter into a full-scale research project, reviewing some 30,000 folk and fairy tales from all around the world. The 100 she selected to create this jewel of an anthology feature "courageous mothers, clever young girls, and warrior women," heroines that save lives and bring peace to their communities not through brute strength, although endurance is a frequent feat, but through creativity, intelligence, eloquence, wisdom, kindness, perseverance, and loyalty. Ragan is to be commended for her diligence and good taste: she has found captivating stories about wonderfully shrewd and fearless heroines from all across Europe, including Iceland, Scotland, Greece, and Yugoslavia, as well as Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, and the Pacific. Ragan's concise yet discerning commentary follows each tale, making this affirming and long overdue collection as edifying as it is entertaining. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Orchardist: A Novel</h2><p><p>At once intimate and epic, <em>The Orchardist</em> is historical fiction at its best, in the grand literary tradition of William Faulkner, Marilynne Robinson, Michael Ondaatje, Annie Proulx, and Toni Morrison.</p><p>In her stunningly original and haunting debut novel, Amanda Coplin evokes a powerful sense of place, mixing tenderness and violence as she spins an engrossing tale of a solitary orchardist who provides shelter to two runaway teenage girls in the untamed American West, and the dramatic consequences of his actions.&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2012</strong>: Set against the rugged beauty of Washington State at the turn of the twentieth century, Amanda Coplin&#x2019;s debut novel, <i> The Orchardist</i>, introduces readers to William Talmadge and his lovingly cultivated orchards of apples and apricots. Coplin&#x2019;s characters are deeply rooted in the mystery of the American West, and she brings them together, like the grafting of Talmadge&#x2019;s trees, to form a unique family bound not by blood but by the shared experience of tragedy, the land, and ultimately fate.--<i>Seira Wilson</i><p>A Best Book of the Year</p><p><em>Washington Post</em> � <em>Seattle Times</em> � <em>The Oregonian</em> � National Public Radio � Amazon � <em>Kirkus Reviews</em> � <em>Publishers Weekly</em> � <em>The Daily Beast</em></p><p>An Indie Next Pick</p><p>Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Award Winner</p><p>At the turn of the twentieth century, in a rural stretch of the Pacific Northwest, a reclusive orchardist, William Talmadge, tends to apples and apricots as if they were loved ones. A gentle man, he's found solace in the sweetness of the fruit he grows and the quiet, beating heart of the land he cultivates. One day, two teenage girls appear and steal his fruit at the market; they later return to the outskirts of his orchard to see the man who gave them no chase.</p><p>Feral, scared, and very pregnant, the girls take up on Talmadge's land and indulge in his deep reservoir of compassion. Just as the girls begin to trust him, men arrive in the orchard with guns, and the shattering tragedy that follows will set Talmadge on an irrevocable course not only to save and protect them but also to reconcile the ghosts of his own troubled past.</p><p>Transcribing America as it once was before railways and roads connected its corners, Amanda Coplin weaves a tapestry of solitary souls who come together in the wake of unspeakable cruelty and misfortune. She writes with breathtaking precision and empathy, and in <em>The Orchardist</em> she crafts an astonishing debut novel about a man who disrupts the lonely harmony of an ordered life when he opens his heart and lets the world in.</p></p><h2>The Education Of A Gardener (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Russell Page, one of the legendary gardeners and landscapers of the twentieth century, designed gardens great and small for clients throughout the world.

Russell Page was born in 1906 and studied art at the Slade School in London before a love of plants drew him to garden design. In his career he designed gardens all over the world, from Leeds Castle in Kent to the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Garden at the Pepsi Cola Headquarters in New York, as well as in France, his home for many years. The Education of a Gardener is a fascinating portrait of a master of his craft and has proved an inspirational book for many gardeners since its first publication in 1962.

Grant was routinely grouped with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in the &#x201c;Trinity of Great American Leaders.&#x201d; But the battlefield commander&#x2013;turned&#x2013;commander-in-chief fell out of favor in the twentieth century. In <i>American Ulysses,</i> Ronald C. White argues that we need to once more revise our estimates of him in the twenty-first.<br><br> Based on seven years of research with primary documents&#x2014;some of them never examined by previous Grant scholars&#x2014;this is destined to become <i>the </i>Grant biography of our time. White, a biographer exceptionally skilled at writing momentous history from the inside out, shows Grant to be a generous, curious, introspective man and leader&#x2014;a willing delegator with a natural gift for managing the rampaging egos of his fellow officers. His wife, Julia Dent Grant, long marginalized in the historic record, emerges in her own right as a spirited and influential partner.<br><br> Grant was not only a brilliant general but also a passionate defender of equal rights in post-Civil War America. After winning election to the White House in 1868, he used the power of the federal government to battle the Ku Klux Klan. He was the first president to state that the government&#x2019;s policy toward American Indians was immoral, and the first ex-president to embark on a world tour, and he cemented his reputation for courage by racing against death to complete his <i>Personal Memoirs</i>. Published by Mark Twain, it is widely considered to be the greatest autobiography by an American leader, but its place in Grant&#x2019;s life story has never been fully explored&#x2014;until now.<br><br> One of those rare books that successfully recast our impression of an iconic historical figure, <i>American Ulysses</i> gives us a finely honed, three-dimensional portrait of Grant the man&#x2014;husband, father, leader, writer&#x2014;that should set the standard by which all future biographies of him will be measured.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>American Ulysses</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Ronald C. White] portrays a deeply introspective man of ideals, a man of measured thought and careful action who found himself in the crosshairs of American history at its most&nbsp;crucial moment.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;White delineates Grant&#x2019;s virtues better than any author before. . . .&nbsp;By the end, readers will see how fortunate the nation was that Grant went into the world&#x2014;to save the Union, to lead it and, on his deathbed, to write one of the finest memoirs in all of American letters.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Ronald White has restored Ulysses S. Grant to his proper place in history with a biography whose breadth and tone suit the man perfectly. Like Grant himself, this book will have staying power.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Magisterial . . . Grant&#x2019;s esteem in the eyes of historians has increased significantly in the last generation. . . . [<i>American Ulysses</i>] is the newest heavyweight champion in this movement.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe</i>&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;Superb . . . illuminating, inspiring and deeply moving.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;In this sympathetic, rigorously sourced biography, White . . . conveys the essence of Grant the man and Grant the warrior.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Newsday</i></b></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2016:</strong> So who is buried in Grant&#x2019;s tomb, anyway? That&#x2019;s an old and insipid joke, of course, but considering what we think we know about the 18th President of the United States, a question worth asking might be hiding in there. With <em>American Ulysses: A Life of Ulysses S. Grant</em>, Ronald C. White endeavors over 800 pages (over 100 them being notes referencing primary and secondary sources) to shed light on one of our most influential yet enigmatic figures. This isn&#x2019;t a revisionist biography; Grant already got that treatment in the early 20th century, when he transformed from a respected Civil War general and public servant into a craven opportunist and failed president, drunk and penniless at his death (just try imagining a destitute former POTUS in this era). White, author of the award-winning bestseller, <em>A. Lincoln: A Biography</em>, first redresses criticisms of his martial prowess&#x2014;primarily that he exploited a huge numbers advantage by needlessly sacrificing troops in exchange for victory&#x2014;with detailed accounts, maps, and illustrations of his conflicts, limning a battlefield acumen previously diminished through <em>ad hominem</em> barbs. White resuscitates Grant&#x2019;s career as a public servant through his presidency and beyond&#x2014;he was a defender of equal rights and an enemy of the Ku Klux Klan--by placing in the context of the complex postbellum landscape, where the war may have been won but the country was hardly whole. Serious, exhaustive, and likely definitive, <em>American Ulysses</em> is a tricky meld of comprehensive research and readable narrative, worthy of the pantheon of monumental presidential biographies. <em>&#x2014;Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Ronald C. White </b>is the author of three bestselling books on Abraham Lincoln, including most recently <i>A. Lincoln</i>. White earned his Ph.D. at Princeton and has lectured on Lincoln at hundreds of universities and other organizations, and at Gettysburg and the White House. He is a Fellow at the Huntington Library and a Senior Fellow of the Trinity Forum of Washington, D.C. He lives with his wife, Cynthia, in La Ca�ada, California.</p><h2>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</h2><p>Twenty to thirty million Americans suffer from some form of diagnosable depression, and their ranks are growing. Psychologist Michael D. Yapko explains that in order to find relief, more than the current episode of depression must be examined. In <i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression,</i> he presents skills that enable readers to understand and ultimately avert depression's recurring cycles. Focusing on future prevention as well as initial treatment, the book includes over one hundred structured activities to help sufferers learn the skills necessary to become and remain depression-free.<br><br><i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i> begins by translating the clinical literature on psychotherapy and antidepressant medication into language that can be used to enhance an understanding of depression, and to personalize individual cures. Yapko uses a conversational, anecdotal tone that encourages readers to take an active approach to helping themselves. Special sections entitled "Learn by Doing" and "Shifting Perspectives" help develop the skills necessary to manage difficult experiences. Readers learn how to solve problems effectively, anticipate the likely consequences of their actions, think and act in a direct, goal-oriented fashion, balance different areas of their lives, and use self-knowledge to stay out of harmful situations.<br><br>More realistic and helpful than other depression-management books on the market, <i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i> defines what causes depression and, best of all, clarifies what can be done about it. With this knowledge in hand, readers can control their depression, rather than having depression control them.</p><p>"If depression has you in its grip, if your spirits need lifting, if tomorrow holds no promise of a better day, don't waste another minute: there's an antidote to feeling lousy and it's this book, <i>Breaking the Patterns of Depression</i>. Michael Yapko will help you unravel the mystery of depression and, more important, he will show you what you can do today to feel better immediately."<br>--Michele Weiner Davis, author of <i>Change Your Life and Everyone in it</i> and<i> Divorce Busting</i><p>"Dr. Yapko has brought this book to all of us who battle the enemy of joy and peace--depression. And it is a wonderful guide. In it, he will teach you, as he has taught me, how to understand depression and how to defeat it. He will teach you how to look at yourself, the world, and the future in a new way. He will teach you that you can have a peaceful and meaningful life, and he will teach you how to do that."<br>--Dr. Lynn D. Johnson, Ph.D., director of the Brief Therapy Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, and author of <i>Psychotherapy in the Age of Accountability</i></p>Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. is the author of seven previous books on brief, directive psychotherapy. He is a clinical psychologist in private practice in Solana Beach, California, and is known nationally and internationally for his work on treating depression with active, brief therapy methods.

The 22 Major Arcana represent Jungian archetypes of the collective unconscious. The figures are visually presented with archways and circular mandalas, which aid in meditation. The court cards depict family roles: father, mother, daughter and son. The deck is a companion to the Jungian Tarot Trilogy by Robert Wang.</p><p>Unavailable for almost a decade, Marcus Aurelius Press is pleased to announce the reissue of this important work by art historian and author, Dr. Robert Wang. <p>The Jungian Tarot Deck, first published in 1988, is intended to be a visual introduction to Jungian philosophy. The key is the archetypal image encountered through creative visualization or, as Jung called it, "active imagination." </p><p>It is a process which may, theoretically, lead to discovery of a true Inner Self. Such creative visualization is at the heart of all mystical and religious systems, from those of the ancient world, to the spiritual exercises of Ignatius Loyola, to Hermeticism and Rosicrucianism, to Alchemy, and to the remarkably creative occult exercises of the nineteenth century. </p><p>One of the main purposes of this work is to demonstrate parallels between Jungian philosophy and Hermetic Kabbalah, a system which has been essential to Western mysticism since the Italian Renaissance which Wang explored in depth in Qabbalistic Tarot. </p><p>Wang considers Jung's ideas about regressions from the personal into the collective to be commensurate with the Kabbalistic method of working backwards from the lowest level of the Tree of Life (the material condition), through the upper levels which symbolize not only the enlightened Self, but a condition of nonbeing which transcends all consciousness, personal or collective.</p>It is my hope that viewing the tarot images in psychological terms may serve to amplify our understanding of a whole class of literature previously considered "mystical." <p>As an art historian my amateur incursion into comparative religion is very tentative and my sources are general. I should also admit that as a historian I have a specific bias. History is, to me, something secure against which religious, mythological, and psychological ideologies must be measured, and it bothers me to find so many discussions of the history of tarot predicated upon irresponsible speculation when the historical tracks of the cards are so clear. </p><p>I have no doubt that the tarot originated in fourteenth-century Italy. Of course interpretation of the tarot in serious psychological terms would have seemed laughable, if not absolutely bizarre to its originators, who developed the cards as a game. </p><p>It was not until the late nineteenth century that tarot was systematically related to Astrology, to Kabbalah, and to Alchemy. And it was the twentieth century which added an overlay of modern psychological theory</p></p><h2>Brave Girl: Clara and the Shirtwaist Makers&#39; Strike of 1909</h2><p><p><strong>The&nbsp;true story of&nbsp;the young immigrant who led the largest strike of women workers in U.S. history.</strong></p><p>This picture book biography about Ukrainian immigrant Clara Lemlich tackles topics like activism and the U.S. garment industry.

The trilogy tells the story of a single Nigerian community over three generations from first colonial contact to urban migration and the breakdown of traditional cultures. He is also the author of&nbsp;<i>Anthills of the Savannah</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Man of the People</i>,&nbsp;<i>Girls at War</i>&nbsp;<i>and Other Stories</i>,&nbsp;<i>Home and Exile</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hopes and Impediments</i>,&nbsp;<i>Collected Poems</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Education of a British-Protected Child</i>,&nbsp;<i>Chike and the River</i>, and&nbsp;<i>There Was a Country</i>. He was the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University and, for more than fifteen years, was the Charles P. Stevenson Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College. Achebe was the recipient of the Nigerian National Merit Award, Nigeria&#x2019;s highest award for intellectual achievement. In 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement.<b>Praise for Chinua Achebe</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A magical writer&#x2014;one of the greatest of the twentieth century.&#x201d; &#x2014;Margaret Atwood<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;African literature is incomplete and unthinkable without the works of Chinua Achebe.&#x201d; &#x2014;Toni Morrison&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Chinua Achebe is gloriously gifted with the magic of an ebullient, generous, great talent.&#x201d; &#x2014;Nadine Gordimer<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Achebe&#x2019;s influence should go on and on . . . teaching and reminding that all humankind is one.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Nation</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;The father of African literature in the English language and undoubtedly one of the most important writers of the second half of the twentieth century.&#x201d; &#x2014;Caryl Phillips,&nbsp;<i>The Observer</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;We are indebted to Achebe for reminding us that art has social and moral dimension&#x2014;a truth often obscured.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;He is one of the few writers of our time who has touched us with a code of values that will never be ironic.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Ondaatje<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;For so many readers around the world, it is Chinua Achebe who opened up the magic casements of African fiction.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kwame Anthony Appiah<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;[Achebe] is one of world literature&#x2019;s great humane voices.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Achebe is one of the most distinguished artists to emerge from the West African cultural renaissance of the post-war world.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Sunday Times&nbsp;</i>(London)<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;[Achebe is] a powerful voice for cultural decolonization.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Village Voice</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Chinua Achebe has shown that a mind that observes clearly but feels deeply enough to afford laughter may be more wise than all the politicians and journalists.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Time</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;The power and majesty of Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s work has, literally, opened the world to generations of readers.

We should all see ourselves&nbsp;from a stranger&#x2019;s perspective at least once in our lives.&nbsp;There&#x2019;s a Jedi walking toward me, all brown robes and&nbsp;earnest piety; no braid, so despite his youth he&#x2019;s not a&nbsp;Padawan any longer. He&#x2019;ll be commanding troops. At the&nbsp;very least, he&#x2019;ll be on active service on his own. The war&nbsp;makes us veterans before our time.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to grab him by the shoulders and ask if he thinks&nbsp;this is a just war, a war fought honorably, but he&#x2019;ll panic if a&nbsp;Mandalorian in full armor accosts him&#x2013;especially one he&#x2019;ll&nbsp;sense is a Force-user like himself. Nobody else is taking&nbsp;much notice of me. Mandalorians on Coruscant are just foreigners,&nbsp;bounty hunters, one more bunch of economic migrants&nbsp;out of the many thousands of species who flock to the&nbsp;galaxy&#x2019;s capital.&nbsp;<br><br>Ah, the Jedi&#x2019;s looking around the crowd. He can sense me.&nbsp;I&#x2019;m lost in the crowd of shoppers and sightseers. It&#x2019;s very&nbsp;strange&#x2013;obscene, even&#x2013;to see everyone going about their&nbsp;business on Coruscant as if we&#x2019;re not in the second year&nbsp;of an ugly war. And for them, of course, they&#x2019;re not.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s someone else&#x2019;s war in every sense&#x2013;fought on other&nbsp;worlds, fought by other beings, fought by men who aren&#x2019;t&nbsp;Coruscant citizens. Clone troopers aren&#x2019;t <i>anyone&#x2019;s </i>citizens.&nbsp;They have no legal rights. They&#x2019;re objects. Chattel. Military&nbsp;assets.&nbsp;<br><br>Nobody should stand back and let that happen, least of all&nbsp;a Jedi.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m just a few meters from the Jedi now. He&#x2019;s so serious,&nbsp;so <i>committed.</i>Yes, that <i>was </i>me, just months ago.&nbsp;<br><br>A passerby glances his way and I sense her unease.&nbsp;When I walked around the city in my robes, I thought&nbsp;that others saw me as someone there to help them. Now I&nbsp;know different; they probably saw someone they didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;trust, with powers they didn&#x2019;t understand, someone they&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t elect but who shaped their lives behind the scenes&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp;<br><br>If they&#x2019;d known how much I could shape their thoughts,&nbsp;too, they&#x2019;d have fled from me.&nbsp;<br><br>The Jedi passes close by, but I still don&#x2019;t recognize him.&nbsp;He stares into the T-slit of my helmet as if I&#x2019;ve grabbed him.&nbsp;I can feel his confusion as I walk on by&#x2013;no, not just confusion:&nbsp;<i>fear. </i>A Force-using Mandalorian has to be on his list of&nbsp;worst nightmares.<br><br>&nbsp;There was a time when it was on mine, too. Funny, that.&nbsp;Then I sense him turn. I feel him working his way back&nbsp;through the crowd toward me, burning with questions. Before&nbsp;he reaches out to tap my shoulder&#x2013;and I have to give&nbsp;him credit for even trying&#x2013;I turn to face him.&nbsp;<br><br>He flinches.

To a Jedi, yes, it is. I used to be Bardan&nbsp;Jusik.

My Jedi Masters didn&#x2019;t raise me to live my life&nbsp;by halves.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Not any longer,&#x201d; I say at last.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You walked out on us in the middle of a war&#x2013;a war we&nbsp;<i>have </i>to fight.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s puzzled, resentful&#x2013;scared. &#x201c;How could&nbsp;you betray us like that?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>I wonder who he means by <i>we: </i>Jedi, or clones?&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I left because it&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d; I shouldn&#x2019;t have to tell him&nbsp;that. &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re using a slave army to do it. Because&nbsp;there&#x2019;s no point fighting one kind of evil if you replace it with&nbsp;your own brand.&#x201d; Get specific. Get personal. Don&#x2019;t give him&nbsp;a chance to look away from his conscience. &#x201c;<i>You, </i>personally.&nbsp;<i>You </i>make that choice each morning.

They happened so long ago; we can probably barely remember, let alone relate to, the little person we once were. But one of the most powerful explanations for why we may, as adults, be struggling, is that we were denied the opportunity to fully be ourselves in our earliest years. Perhaps we were over-disciplined and cowed, not allowed to be wilful or difficult &#x2013; and so learned to tell white lies and people-please. Or perhaps our caregivers were preoccupied or fragile and so we had to assume the role of parent, burying our true needs and desires deep underground.<br>When we thoroughly examine our upbringings, the larger implications for our adult selves are clear to see. Once we understand the roots from which our flaws stem, we can set about correcting the harmful behaviours we mistakenly believe to be innate. This book is a guide to better understanding our younger selves in order to shape who we wish to be in the future. It explores to what extent we can pin our actions in the present to our experiences in the past, and how we might then break free from the learned patterns of our childhoods.</p><p><p><strong>The School of Life</strong> is a global organization helping people lead more fulfilled lives.

Hay, the New York Times best-selling author of You Can Heal Your Life</p><h2>Tao Te Ching</h2><p>In what may be the most faithful translation of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, the translators have captured the terse, enigmatic beauty of the original masterpiece without embellishing it with personal interpretation or bogging it down with explanatory notes. By stepping out of the way and letting the original text speak for itself, they deliver a powerfully direct experience of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> that is a joy to come back to again and again. <br><br>And for the first time in any translation of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, now you can interact with the text to experience for yourself the nuanced art of translating. In each of the eighty-one chapters, one significant line has been highlighted and alongside it are the original Chinese characters with their transliteration. You can then turn to the glossary and translate this line on your own, thereby deepening your understanding of the original text and of the myriad ways it can be translated into English. <br><br> Complementing the text are twenty-three striking ink paintings brushed by Stephen Addiss and an introduction by the esteemed Asia scholar Burton Watson.</p><p>With this edition of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, an unlikely team of a Japanese art expert and a Greek translator pull off a uniquely powerful version of the text. If one thing marks the language of the original <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, it is linguistic spareness. Stephen Addiss and Stanley Lombardo are the first to succeed in duplicating the language in English, and although their search for just the right word occasionally goes far afield, they are mostly successful. The effect can be quite liberating as the full ambiguity of meaning comes through and you are afforded the freedom to interpret in a variety of ways. The translators also enhance the atmosphere of the book with Addiss's expressive calligraphy and the two lines in the original Chinese that are retained in each chapter. Addiss and Lombardo's rendering of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> gets you right down into the primary source, and from there you're free to wander where you will.The TAO-TE-CHING, the ancient Taoist text written by philospher Lao-Tzu in the sixth century B.C., has inspired millions of people from all different backgrounds. This beautiful edition contains Chinese characters alongside the English text and is illustrated with black and white drawings. Commentary from the translators helps to illuminate the ideas discussed in the text so that modern-day readers can fully appreciate the meaning.</p><h2>Christian Life New Testament With Master Outlines And Study Notes</h2><p><p>A New Testament Bible to help you grow in the Spirit and access biblical truth for life&#x2019;s questions&#x2014;on the go!

Inspiring and entertaining non-fiction." - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<br><br><b>A Robert F. Sibert Honor Book<br><br>Winner of the Schneider Family Book Award<br></b><br><b><b>An ALA-ALSC Notable Children's Book<br></b></b><br><b>Winner of the NCTE Orbis Pictus Award for Outstanding Nonfiction for Children</b><br><br>As a child in the late 1800s, Horace Pippin loved to draw: <i>He loved the feel of the charcoal as it slid across the floor. He loved looking at something in the room and making it come alive again in front of him.</i> He drew pictures for his sisters, his classmates, his co-workers. Even during W.W.I, Horace filled his notebooks with drawings from the trenches . . . until he was shot. Upon his return home, Horace couldn't lift his right arm, and couldn't make any art. Slowly, with lots of practice, he regained use of his arm, until once again, he was able to paint--and paint, and paint! Soon, people&#x2014;including the famous painter N. C. Wyeth&#x2014;started noticing Horace's art, and before long, his paintings were displayed in galleries and museums across the country.<br><br>Jen Bryant and Melissa Sweet team up once again to share this inspiring story of a self-taught painter from humble beginnings who despite many obstacles, was ultimately able to do what he loved, and be recognized for who he was: an artist.</p><p>JEN BRYANT has published poetry, biographies, picture books, and fiction for young readers. Her last picture-book biography collaboration with Melissa Sweet, <i>A River of Words: The Story of William Carlos Williams,</i> was a Caldecott Honor Book. Jen lives with her family in southeastern Pennsylvania.<br><br>MELISSA SWEET is the Caldecott Honor artist of <i>A River of Words</i> by Jen Bryant, <i>The Sleepy Little Alphabet</i> by Judy Sierra, and <i>Mrs. Harkness and the Panda</i> by Alicia Potter, among others. She is also the author-illustrator of <i>Balloons Over Broadway,</i> which was awarded a Robert F. Sibert Medal.*Starred Review* Born in Pennsylvania in 1888, Horace Pippin loved to draw and paint as a child. When he was in eighth grade, his father left the family. Horace quit school and worked to support them. Later wounded as a soldier in WWI, he never regained full use of his right arm. Back home, Pippin began painting again, using his left arm to guide his right. Painting subjects drawn mainly from observation, memory, family stories, and the Bible, this self-taught African American artist was eventually discovered by the art community. Major museums display his works, and their locations are indicated on the U.S. map on the back endpapers, along with small reproductions of six paintings. In a well-structured narrative with recurring themes and a highly accessible style, Bryant writes short sentences full of memorable details, from Pippin&#x2019;s first box of colored pencils to the scavenged house paints he used to paint his wartime memories. Combining drawings and printed elements with watercolor and gouache paints, Sweet&#x2019;s mixed-media illustrations have a refreshing, down-home style and a brilliance all their own. The artwork incorporates large-print quotes, giving Pippin a voice here as well. Outstanding.

What do you do when you&#x2019;re feeling a little bit chicken? </p><p><b>Kate Dicamillo:</b> When I think of Louise, the words that come to mind are insouciant and unflappable. I suppose that when all is said and done, she is brave. But she's also kind of, um, *clueless.* As for me, when I am feeling afraid, I squawk and flap my wings and run around in circles and then I go ahead and try to do the thing that I'm pretty sure I can't do. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> I know pirates don't keep very good records, but have you found any historical evidence of chickens adventuring with pirates? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> Yes, it's true, pirates don't keep great records. But there are several diaries of chickens that have survived through the ages and they paint a quite colorful (and detailed (and sometimes horrifiying)) picture of the many adventures that chickens have had with pirates. I refererred to these diaries when I was doing my research. They were written in chicken scratch; it was slow going. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> If Louise, Despereaux, and Mercy Watson went on an adventure together, what do you think would happen? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> Wow, there's a picture . . . let's see. I can envision Louise standing on Mercy's back and Despereaux perched on Louise's head. *Anything* could happen, I suppose. And would. But I'm sure that whatever happened, it would involve toast, hot air balloons, cluelessness and Despereaux ultimately saving the day. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> This is your first collaboration with Harry Bliss. Did you have his style in mind when you wrote the story, or did you join up with him afterward? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> When I wrote Louise, I didn't have a particular illustrator in mind. But the chicken (the whole world!) that Harry has brought to life in this book has delighted and humbled me. He's a genius. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> You've written award-winning books for kids of every age. Do you tell a different kind of story for each age, or do you think all kids find the same elements appealing? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> I don't think about what age the story is for or who or why.

Unlike their human counterparts, who must alter the environment to accommodate physical limitations, animals are adaptable to an amazing range of conditions. </p> <p> Examining everything from food sources in the extremely barren winter land-scape to the chemical composition that allows certain creatures to survive, Heinrich's Winter World awakens the largely undiscovered mysteries by which nature sustains herself through winter's harsh, cruel exigencies. </p></p><p><p>The author of numerous bestselling and award-winning books, Bernd Heinrich is a professor of biology at the University of Vermont. He divides his time between Vermont and the forests of western Maine.</p>The author explores the adaptations of animals to extreme cold, explaining the important differences between torpor and hibernation. While the work is reminiscent of a series of science lectures, its moderate doses of chemistry, physics, biology, and botany will engage general readers. Heinrich&#39;s stories of taking students on wintry expeditions into the field make him sound like a wonderful hands-on teacher. Narrator Mel Foster reads with little emotion and a nearly mechanical tone. His renditions of the many genus and species names don&#39;t roll off his tongue with any fluency, giving him little resemblance to a life scientist. Since the author writes in the first person, Foster does not come through well as his surrogate.

Inspired by friends telling stories on a porch, The Moth was born in small-town Georgia, garnered a cult following in New York City, and then rose to national acclaim with the wildly popular podcast and Peabody Award-winning weekly public radio show <i>The Moth Radio Hour</i>.<br><br>Stories include: writer Malcolm Gladwell's wedding toast gone horribly awry; legendary rapper Darryl "DMC" McDaniels' obsession with a Sarah McLachlan song; poker champion Annie Duke's two-million-dollar hand; and A. E. Hotchner's death-defying stint in a bullring . . . with his friend Ernest Hemingway. Read about the panic of former Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart when he misses Air Force One after a hard night of drinking in Moscow, and Dr. George Lombardi's fight to save Mother Teresa's life.<br><br>This will be a beloved read for existing Moth enthusiasts, fans of the featured storytellers, and all who savor well-told, hilarious, and heartbreaking stories.</p><p>The Moth is an acclaimed not-for-profit organization dedicated to the art and craft of storytelling. It is a celebration of both the raconteur, who breathes fire into true tales of ordinary life, and the storytelling novice, who has lived through something extraordinary and yearns to share it. At the center of each performance is, of course, the story and The Moth's directors work with each storyteller to find, shape and present it.

After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.The Law of Success has helped hundreds of thousands of people to move through obstacles and invite all-around success fully into their lives.

It is the life Matt's always wanted; convinced he's lighter than air, he imagines himself as buoyant as the hydrium gas that powers his ship. One night he meets a dying balloonist who speaks of beautiful creatures drifting through the skies. It is only after Matt meets the balloonist's granddaughter that he realizes that the man's ravings may, in fact, have been true, and that the creatures are completely real and utterly mysterious. </p><p>In a swashbuckling adventure reminiscent of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson, Kenneth Oppel, author of the best-selling <em>Silverwing</em> trilogy, creates an imagined world in which the air is populated by transcontinental voyagers, pirates, and beings never before dreamed of by the humans who sail the skies.</p></p><p><p><strong>KENNETH OPPEL </strong>wrote his first novel at age fourteen and hasn&#x2019;t looked back.

Hero/narrator Matt (David Kelly), a cabin boy on a lighter-than-air liner in the book's Jules Vernesian world, finds adventure and romance among pirates and mysterious flying creatures on an uncharted island. Kelly's voice is irresistibly likable and engaging, though he does overact slightly. His narration frequently continues the tone of preceding speeches, especially questions. Some scenes call out for sound effects, and there are none. But these are quibbles. The original music is excellent; the story, if occasionally predictable, is well told and its world charming.

Turn on the TV. Incompetent leadership is everywhere, and there's no denying that most of these leaders are men.</b></p><p>In this timely and provocative book, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic asks two powerful questions: Why is it so easy for incompetent men to become leaders? And why is it so hard for competent people--especially competent women--to advance?</p><p>Marshaling decades of rigorous research, Chamorro-Premuzic points out that although men make up a majority of leaders, they underperform when compared with female leaders. In fact, most organizations equate leadership potential with a handful of destructive personality traits, like overconfidence and narcissism. In other words, these traits may help someone get selected for a leadership role, but they backfire once the person has the job.</p><p>When competent women--and men who don't fit the stereotype--are unfairly overlooked, we all suffer the consequences. The result is a deeply flawed system that rewards arrogance rather than humility, and loudness rather than wisdom.</p><p>There is a better way. With clarity and verve, Chamorro-Premuzic shows us what it really takes to lead and how new systems and processes can help us put the right people in charge.</p></p><p><p><b>Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</b> is the Chief Talent Scientist at ManpowerGroup, a professor of business psychology at University College London and at Columbia University, and an associate at Harvard's Entrepreneurial Finance Lab.</p><p>Author social media/website info: drtomascp.com, @drtcp</p><p><b>Named a <i>Financial Times</i> Business Book of the Month</b></p><p><b>Named one of "14 business books everyone will be reading in 2019" -- <i>Business Insider</i></b></p><p>Advance Praise for <b><i> Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders?

Provocative. Shocking.</b> <br> Call them what you will...but don't call them open and shut. <br> Did Lizzie Borden murder her own father and stepmother? Was Jack the Ripper actually the Duke of Clarence? Who killed JonBenet Ramsey? America's foremost expert on criminal profiling and twenty-five-year FBI veteran John Douglas, along with author and filmmaker Mark Olshaker, explores those tantalizing questions and more in this mesmerizing work of detection. With uniquely gripping analysis, the authors reexamine and reinterpret the accepted facts, evidence, and victimology of the most notorious murder cases in the history of crime, including the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, the Zodiac Killer, and the Whitechapel murders. Utilizing techniques developed by Douglas himself, they give detailed profiles and reveal chief suspects in pursuit of what really happened in each case. <i>The Cases That Haunt Us</i> not only offers convincing and controversial conclusions, it deconstructs the evidence and widely held beliefs surrounding each case and rebuilds them -- with fascinating, surprising, and haunting results.</p><p>Confident in his opinions and systematic in his examination of high-profile whodunits, FBI veteran John Douglas proves his worth once again as one of the world's best psychological detectives. You may think you've read all there is about Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, and the Lindbergh kidnapping, but Douglas has a few surprise conclusions in his modern analysis of these gripping crimes. By applying criminal personality profiling techniques he developed while stalking more current killers, Douglas provides a fresh, sage outlook on some disturbing history. He also sheds new light on San Francisco's Zodiac Killer, the Black Dahlia murder, Bambi Bembenek, the Boston Strangler, and the continuing mystery of who killed 6-year-old JonBen�t Ramsey. Douglas sometimes reveals his chief suspect; other times he simply narrows down who the killer is not. In the JonBen�t mystery (in which Douglas was hired by the Ramseys to find the killer), he presents a convincing case for why he believes the girl's parents are not guilty of murder. Douglas is founder of the FBI's Serial Killer Profiling Unit. His method of solving a crime by entering the mind of the killer inspired Thomas Harris's book <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. In this dissection of our most sensational crimes, Douglas proves that reality can be more horrifying than fiction. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Slaying Dragons: A Practical Guide to Spiritual Warfare</h2><p><b>The real fight is the one you can't see.</b><br><br> The supernatural realm is very real, and it directly impacts our day-to-day lives.

An unseasonably hot, dry summer has turned the state of Maine into a tinderbox, and Grace and her husband, Gene, have fallen out of love and barely speak. Five months pregnant and caring for two toddlers, Grace has resigned herself to a life of loneliness and domestic chores. One night she awakes to find that wildfires are racing down the coast, closer and closer to her house.&nbsp; Forced to pull her children into the ocean to escape the flames, Grace watches helplessly as everything she knows burns to the ground.&nbsp; By morning, her life is forever changed: she is homeless, penniless, awaiting news of her husband's fate, and left to face an uncertain future in a town that no longer exists. With courage and stoicism, Grace overcomes devastating loss and, through the smoke, is able to glimpse the opportunity to rewrite her own story.</p><p><b>Anita Shreve</b>&nbsp;was the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author of seventeen novels that have been translated into thirty-six languages. She lived with her husband in New Hampshire.Hot breath on Grace&#x2019;s face. Claire is screaming, and Grace is on her feet. As she lifts her daughter, a wall of fire fills the window. Perhaps a quarter of a mile back, if even that. Where&#x2019;s Gene? Didn&#x2019;t he come home? She picks Tom up from his crib and feels a wet diaper. No time to change him.<br> &nbsp;<br> She scurries down the stairs carrying both children. She deposits them in the carriage in the hallway and pushes it onto the screened porch. Claire begins to cough in the smoky air. &#x201c;Sweetie,&#x201d; Grace croons, &#x201c;have you saved us all?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She stuffs blankets, diapers, baby food, and water into the carriage behind the children. She loops the kids&#x2019; clothes around the upper bits of metal and ties them in knots. She&#x2019;ll have to leave the mementos.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because she can&#x2019;t push the now too-heavy carriage over the lip of the porch, she reverses it in order to drag it down the step. Claire is crying, and so is Tom, but Grace has no time to soothe them.<br> &nbsp;<br> As she maneuvers the vehicle to the edge of the grass, a bomb goes off, the explosion one Grace can feel right through her feet and legs. The children are silent, as if awed by the sound.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A fuel tank in a house on Seventh Street,&#x201d; she hears one man shout to another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sparks and embers swirl around Grace. There&#x2019;s chaos in the streets. She hears cars moving, women screaming. Balls of flame seem to leap from treetop to treetop, giving the fire a frightening momentum. A tree catches fire at the top, and the fire races down the trunk and into a house below. Another bomb. The fire turns tree after tree into tall torches.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fields resemble hot coals. For as far as she can see, there&#x2019;s an unbroken line of fire. Cars are traveling, but where can they go?<br> &nbsp;<br> An ember lands on the hood of the carriage. Grace swipes it off and begins to run. Heat and common sense push her to the seawall. A deer leaps across the street with her, chased by the freight train bearing down on all of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> She takes the children from the carriage and sets them on a blanket on the sand. On another blanket, she lays out what few provisions she has brought. Abandoning the carriage, she begins to drag both blankets away from the fire and closer to the water. When the sand feels wet underfoot, she stops.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Smoke adds to the confusion. She spots, and then doesn&#x2019;t, Rosie dragging a canoe.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rosie!&#x201d; Grace calls.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Grace, where are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right at the water. There you are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace helps her friend drag the canoe beside the two blankets. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Gene and Tim?&#x201d; Rosie wails.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Grace says, shaken.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where are all the people going?&#x201d; Rosie asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To the schoolhouse, I heard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy. The schoolhouse will burn, if it hasn&#x2019;t already.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace kneels on the blanket to change Tom&#x2019;s diaper. His sleeper is dry enough to stay on. Grace can feel heat on her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Rosie cries.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Hinkel house just went. It&#x2019;s only one street back from us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace has no words. When she glances up, the fire burning on the ground resembles hot jewels among the rocks and pebbles.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rosie, take what you can from the canoe and put it near the water&#x2019;s edge. Then push the canoe out to sea.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s wood. If an ember falls inside, it will bring the fire right to us. Wet your hair and the kids&#x2019; hair.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rosie follows Grace&#x2019;s instructions. She&#x2019;s glad that Rosie won&#x2019;t see her own house go up. Already, roof shingles are burning.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do my kids, too,&#x201d; Grace yells to buy more time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The splendid maple next to Grace&#x2019;s own house turns orange in an instant, as if someone had switched on a light. The tree collapses. Grace can&#x2019;t see her screened porch, but she knows the fire will consume that next and lead straight into the house. She left the photographs, the papers, the layette, the antique tools.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rosie&#x2019;s house explodes, the fire having found the fuel tank in the basement. Rosie snaps her head up.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rosie, don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Grace commands, and there must be something in her voice that makes her friend obey, because Rosie turns to the water and puts her face in her hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace imagines the fire eating its way through her own home. The kitchen with the wringer washer, the hallway where the carriage is kept, the living room in which Grace made the slipcovers and drapes (an image of the fire climbing the drapes like a squirrel momentarily freezes her), upstairs to the children&#x2019;s beds, her own marriage bed. All their belongings, gone. Everything she and Gene have worked to have, gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rosie, listen. Go down to the water&#x2019;s edge so that only your feet are in the water. Lay down facing the sand&#x2014;make an air pocket&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll bring you Ian and Eddie. Put a child under each arm and hold them close. Make air pockets for them, too. I&#x2019;m going to soak your blanket and drape it over you. I&#x2019;m going to cover your heads. Don&#x2019;t look up and don&#x2019;t reach out a hand or let your hair out from under the blanket.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rosie is silent.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay?&#x201d; Grace shouts.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Rosie says.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace races into the sea to wet the blanket. Men in jackets and caps carry children toward the water, as if in a great and horrible sacrificial act. The women, with provisions, follow. She lays the blanket over Rosie and her children just as she said she would. Then she sets her own children in the sand and wets another blanket. Tugging the dripping wool, she fetches Tom and lies down facing up, pulling the blanket to her face and anchoring it with her feet. She beckons for Claire to come to her. When she has the children securely beside her, she lets go for a second and flips onto her stomach, making three air pockets. She rolls the children over so that they are all facedown in the sand. Holding her hair back with one hand, she drapes the blanket up and over their heads. She checks around Claire and Tom to make sure nothing is sticking outside the covering.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She hears screams&#x2014;not of pain, but of horror, and she guesses that the waterfront houses are about to go. People who have not managed to get out of town are trapped like rats running for the sea. She prays an animal will not step on her or, worse, try to burrow inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> The heat on their heads and backs is just this side of bearable. The blanket won&#x2019;t stay wet for long.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rosie!&#x201d; Grace shouts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace can hear nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rosie!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Still here!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Squiggle back into the water till it&#x2019;s up to your thighs, just short of the kids&#x2019; feet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do it, please.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace follows her own instructions and is in water nearly to her waist. She wishes she had thought to make a cave for her stomach. She creates new air pockets for herself and the children.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t look up. Rosie, did you hear me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you look up?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grace takes shallow breaths, afraid she might inhale sand. She wonders if she and her children will die like this, the fire advancing to the dune grass at the seawall and then igniting Grace&#x2019;s blanket. Would it be too late by the time she felt the pain, or would she have a few seconds to get Tom and Claire into the water up to their shoulders? She might have to dunk herself and the kids if the fire gets that close. Does sand burn?<br> &nbsp;<br> She can do nothing but wait until the fire exhausts itself. The seawater must be in the mid-sixties, and she has begun to shiver under the blanket. She has on only her cotton nightgown. The children are hardly more dressed than she. She can&#x2019;t tell if the shivering is simply because of the cold, or if it stems from fear. Heat leaves the body quickly when one is lying on the ground, though the top of her feels as if it might sear at any minute. She would rather suffer the cold until the fire is well and truly out. How long will that take?<br> &nbsp;<br> Around her, she hears timbers crashing, grass crackling. How many people are on the beach now? She doesn&#x2019;t dare look. She wishes she could calm herself, but it&#x2019;s impossible with the shivering. She has only one task now, to save her children.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Rosie&#x2019;s children and Rosie.<br> &nbsp;<br> The shaking becomes so severe, the children seem to catch it. Nature&#x2019;s way of keeping them warm inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When she can no longer resist peeking, the moon is red. Burned trees fall to the ground amid showers of sparks. The entire town, for as far as Grace can see, is ablaze. Nothing moves but the fire&#x2014;hungry, angry, relentless.<br> &nbsp;<br> This must be what hell is like, she thinks as she lowers the blanket. <br><br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpted from&nbsp;THE STARS ARE FIRE by Anita Shreve.

Yet, as an ancient civilization, the region had both an historical and cultural coherence. This shared past is at the heart of this ambitious book, which traces the story of East Asia from the dawn of history to the twenty-first century. The second edition has been imaginatively revised and expanded to place emphasis on cross-cultural interactions and connections, both within East Asia and beyond, with new material on Vietnam and modern pop culture. The second edition also features a Chinese character list, additional maps and new illustrations.</p><p>This imaginatively revised new edition, which traces the story of East Asia from the dawn of history to the twenty-first century, features new material on Vietnam and modern pop culture, an emphasis on cross-cultural connections, and a Chinese character list.

True, he&#x2019;s not around to take out the trash, but he&#x2019;s great to bitch at while I&#x2019;m doing it myself, and he&#x2019;s generally excellent company, invisibility notwithstanding. And as someone to blame he&#x2019;s unparalleled, because he isn&#x2019;t there to contradict me, on account of being cremated. I talk to him a lot, though our conversations have devolved from metaphysical explorations of the meaning of death to generic married conversations about what to have for dinner, or who&#x2019;s on the hook for the lost tax returns.</p><p>When he died in a car accident, fifty feet from our front door, I seriously considered dying too, too. Not because my heart was broken, though that was true, but because my mind was completely boggled by the logistical challenges of living without him. However, it&#x2019;s just as well I didn&#x2019;t, because he would have been waiting for me in heaven, and man, would he have been pissed. He&#x2019;d have made eternity feel like forever, I can promise you that.</p><p>I was driving along, letting my brain spiral aimlessly, when my phone rang. It was my sister, Rachel.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Lil, are you on your way to get the kids?&#x201d; Just the sound of her voice made me smile.</p><p>&#x201c;I am. Your knowledge of my daily schedule is embarrassing for both of us.&#x201d; I flicked on the indicator, slowed a little for the light, and made a turn. All with the phone illegally wedged under my ear. Sometimes I astound even myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you pick something up for me on your way back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I coming to your house?&#x201d; Maybe I&#x2019;d forgotten. It wasn&#x2019;t impossible.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you might have been. How do I know? Anyway, I haven&#x2019;t seen the kids for a couple of days, and you know how they pine.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. &#x201c;I can honestly say they haven&#x2019;t mentioned you once.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed back at me. &#x201c;You know, one day you&#x2019;ll accept they love me more than you, and your denial of it isn&#x2019;t helping any of us move forward.&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled into the carpool line, doing the silent eyebrow raise and smile of greeting through the windshield at the teacher on duty. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ll admit they&#x2019;re fond of you. What is it you need, anyway? Something fundamental, like milk, or something more typical, like lubricant and a Duraflame?&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly a small palm smacked the window, making me jump and leaving a smear. Its owner, Annabel, peered in and narrowed her eyes. Her younger sister Clare stood behind her, gazing spacily around. Behind both of them, the teacher smiled tightly, telegraphing long-suffering patience with an undercurrent of threat if I didn&#x2019;t get my ass in gear. I hurriedly hit the door-open button. I&#x2019;d hate for her to drag out the death ray on my account.</p><p>My sister was answering me. &#x201c;I need a pound of bacon, some Parmesan cheese, spaghetti, eggs, a loaf of bread, and a bottle of red wine. And butter, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you back.&#x201d; I straightened my head, dropping the phone on the floor. &#x201c;Do you need help or can you get her in, Bel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got it.&#x201d;</p><p>Annabel was only seven but had the gravitas of a forty-year-old career diplomat. She&#x2019;d been born that way, calmly mastering breast-feeding, crawling, eating solids, and whatever else I threw at her. She regarded the world resignedly, as if we were exactly as we&#x2019;d been described in the brochure: a little underwhelming, but what can you do? She buckled Clare in, struggling with the straps.</p><p>&#x201c;Too tight?&#x201d;</p><p>Clare shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Too loose?&#x201d;</p><p>Clare shook her head, her large brown eyes fastened trustingly on her older sister. Annabel nodded at her, turning to climb into her own seat, fastening her own harness with the self-assurance of a test pilot on his fiftieth run, rather than someone with no front teeth and a Dora barrette in her hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Good to go,&#x201d; she informed me.</p><p>&#x201c;Clare?&#x201d; I wanted to make sure the little one hadn&#x2019;t lost the power of speech since breakfast. Presumably, I&#x2019;d have gotten a call from the teacher, but with all these budget cuts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Good to go, cheerio.&#x201d; OK, smallest planet heard from.</p><p>I scrabbled around on the floor for my phone and called Rachel back. I put it on speaker this time and yelled at it as it lay in my lap. After all, now I had the kids in the car. Safety first, people. Rachel picked up before it even rang on my end. She&#x2019;s a very busy woman.</p><p>I watched for a gap in the traffic as I yelled at the phone. &#x201c;Hey, why didn&#x2019;t you say bring me the fixings for pasta carbonara? And why can&#x2019;t you stop on your way home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I like to give you little riddles to solve, little challenges that keep you on your toes. Otherwise, your brain will atrophy, and then who will help the kids with their homework?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you cooking for us, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I certainly can. I&#x2019;d be happy to. Why are you shouting at me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not shouting at you, the Bluetooth&#x2019;s broken. But I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re making dinner.&#x201d; I took a left.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going to the store?&#x201d; asked Annabel. I knew she found the store irritating but was balancing that against the possibility of sudden candy.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;One other thing,&#x201d; added my sister. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to tell me how to make it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then are we going to Aunty Rachel&#x2019;s?&#x201d; asked Clare.</p><p>I nodded and then shook my head. My sister was doing her Jedi-mind-trick &#x201c;These aren&#x2019;t the droids you&#x2019;re looking for&#x201d; thing. &#x201c;Wait, Rach, let me ask you this: If I&#x2019;m buying the groceries and making the dinner, why aren&#x2019;t you coming to my house?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s a much better idea. Thanks! I&#x2019;ll see you later on.&#x201d; She started to hang up.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; I interrupted. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re coming over, you can pick up the groceries. I&#x2019;ve got the kids, remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah. OK.&#x201d; She hung up.</p><p>I looked at Clare in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;No, honey, Aunty Rachel is coming to our place.&#x201d;</p><p>Both kids looked happy to hear it. They really did like her better than me. And why not? She could turn a request for a favor into an invitation to dinner and make you feel good about it.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>Preparing Your Garden</p><p>As soon as&nbsp;your soil is soft enough to work, turn it over with a fork and leave it alone for several days.</p><p>Cover the soil with a 1-inch-thick layer of compost.

Actually, I spend my days slumped in an office chair, destroying my posture and working on a computer. There is sunshine, of course, this being Southern California.</p><p>I love doing traditional illustration, the pencil and paint stuff, and I wish I had more time to do it, but when I left college, the job I found was illustrating school textbooks. I took the job expecting it to be a good starting place, but it turned out to be a great big comfy chair of a job, with a good salary, benefits, free coffee, and all the second-grade textbooks I could ever want. Eighty-two percent of American school children use Poplar Press products, and have done so for nearly a century. I love it. I learn all kinds of interesting stuff, and I draw and create things kids look at and, presumably, doodle little hats and mustaches on. Once, Annabel brought home one of my textbooks&#x2014;Kids in History, Fourth Edition&#x2014;and I saw that dozens of kids had used it, each of them adding new details to my historical figures I never would have imagined. Who knew Martin Van Buren was so well hung?</p><p>There are four of us in the creative department, plus a full-time writer, three fact-checkers, and a general assistant who&#x2019;s been there forever and who actually runs the whole place. She looked up as I walked through the door that morning, and pursed her lips.</p><p>&#x201c;Checking sent back your whale penis, Lilian.&#x201d;</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. &#x201c;Rose, how long have you been waiting to say that?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t flicker. &#x201c;I got in at seven, so a couple of hours, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>I kept walking. &#x201c;Tell them they&#x2019;ll have their penis back in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>She coughed. &#x201c;I already told them they could have it back later.&#x201d;</p><p>I stopped and turned. &#x201c;Why did you do that?&#x201d;</p><p>She was looking at the magazine she&#x2019;d hidden beneath her desk. &#x201c;Because then I could say, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll have your penis back at the end of the day, but it will be hard.&#x2019; &#x201c;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see how that would be difficult to pass up.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged. &#x201c;In the maelstrom of tedium that is my day, I grab what rays of sunshine I can.&#x201d;</p><p>My office mate Sasha looked up as I walked in. &#x201c;Hey, did Rose tell you about the penis?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she did. Did you still need me to help you with your biology book?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The development of the chicken egg? It can wait.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;OK, thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Sasha shrugged. &#x201c;The chicken should probably come first anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Let me be clear: The creative department of Poplar Press is not usually a comedy mecca. Often it is very dull, especially if we&#x2019;re updating a chemistry text or something. But it does have its moments, and there is the coffee.</p><p>I sat down, opened up the whale-penis file, and stared at it. It&#x2019;s not a whole file of whale penises (penii?); it&#x2019;s just one relatively small illustration in a veterinary-medicine textbook, and I&#x2019;d been a little suspicious of why it was even included. Yes, it was important to be thorough, but how many vets were going to need to operate on a whale penis? It&#x2019;s not like the last time you took your parakeet to the vet you couldn&#x2019;t get into the waiting room on account of the impotent whale sitting nervously on several hard chairs. Or a young whale couple, holding hands and looking enviously at the baby animals in cardboard boxes all around them, occasionally shooting each other supportive glances and clearing their throats. I checked my e-mail: The fact-checkers had sent it back simply because one of the labels was misspelled. How did they even catch that? I picked up the phone and punched in a number.</p><p>&#x201c;Fact-checking, Al here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Al, it&#x2019;s Lili.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Lili, sorry about your penis.&#x201d;</p><p>I shifted in my chair. &#x201c;Jesus, what is it with everyone this morning? You&#x2019;re all beside yourselves about the penis.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As it were.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So here&#x2019;s my question, Al. Are you sure there&#x2019;s a mistake? My input from the editor agrees with what I have, so what do you have there, an encyclopedia of penises? PenisCheck 2000?&#x201d;</p><p>I could hear him grinning. &#x201c;I cannot divulge the sources of the fact-checking department, you know that. I&#x2019;d have to kill you, and then we&#x2019;d lose our best illustrator.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to Sasha. &#x201c;Your boyfriend just said I&#x2019;m the best illustrator.&#x201d;</p><p>We could both hear Al yelping. Sasha shrugged without turning around.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell him now I&#x2019;ve seen Moby&#x2019;s gear, I&#x2019;ve lost all interest in him anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Al, she&#x2019;s leaving you for a cetacean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Again? That whore. No, but seriously, our guy at the aquarium caught the typo, and we checked with the editor, and his original content was wrong. No big deal, just checking the facts. We see a fact, we check it. It&#x2019;s our job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, well, OK, then. I didn&#x2019;t know you had a tame-whale guy on call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Again, I cannot reveal my sources, but how else do you think two scruffy guys with liberal-arts degrees proof all this stuff, if not for a fat, fat Rolodex of smart people with very narrow fields of focus?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You make a good point, Al.&#x201d; I hung up, fixed the word, and re-sent the document to Rose. In the cover note, I wrote she could stick the penis in fact-checking&#x2019;s in-box, which I knew she would appreciate.</p><p>My phone rang. Rose. &#x201c;Upstairs wants to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>I frowned. &#x201c;Am I getting fired?&#x201d;</p><p>She clicked her tongue. &#x201c;No clue. Why don&#x2019;t you gather your balls in your right hand and go upstairs and find out for yourself?&#x201d; Rumor has it Rose was the mistress of the first Mr. Poplar, and was installed in the art department, as it was originally called, to hide her from his wife. Seeing as that would make her around 80, and she is not that, I doubt it, but clearly she has embarrassing info on somebody. Otherwise, they would have fired her long ago. She has people skills like lions have gazelle skills. I sighed and headed upstairs to face Roberta King, my general manager.</p><p>Roberta King was probably around my age, but we had as much in common as a roller skate and a race car. (This isn&#x2019;t the best analogy for either of us but was something my dad always said and it springs to mind. He died last year, but I am keeping him alive by stealing his best material.) Roberta and I had met maybe half a dozen times, at work activities that sought to build community through trust falls and other excruciating experiences, and all I could remember about her was that she had looked as uncomfortable as I had felt.</p><p>I was wearing my working-mother-at-work ensemble, consisting of a long skirt over boots (with two different socks underneath, but the skirt covered them), a long-sleeve T-shirt that I had slept in, and a V-necked and somewhat stretched sweater from Target. Roberta was wearing a suit. She smelled of flowers. I smelled of waffles.</p><p>However, she was smiling at me as if we were old friends, which of course meant I was about to get fired.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Roberta. Rose said you wanted to see me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, hi, Lili, come on in. Take a seat.&#x201d; She pushed her chair back from her desk and crossed her legs, indicating that this was a casual, girl-to-girl type of thing. I sat at an angle, like you do, and crossed my legs, too.</p><p>&#x201c;How are the kids?&#x201d; Ooh, a personal question.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re good, thanks. You know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Shit, I had trailed off. Why was this difficult? I was a woman, she was a woman, we both worked in publishing, ovulated, perspired, ate ice cream and felt guilty about it, read People at the checkout, wondered what people thought of us. We should be able to be relaxed.</p><p>&#x201c;Two little girls, right?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;And one dead husband?&#x201d; OK, she didn&#x2019;t say that. I just added it in my head. People often ask, when they don&#x2019;t know you, &#x201c;Oh, and where&#x2019;s your husband?&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;And what does your husband do?&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s very hard not to reply, &#x201c;In heaven, hopefully.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Oh, he mostly just rots.&#x201d; But anyway, she didn&#x2019;t mention him, which meant she remembered he was dead and was being polite and thoughtful. Bitch.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Lili. As you know, things are a little tight in publishing right now. Education budgets are getting cut all over the country, and that&#x2019;s having a direct impact on our business, of course. Poplar&#x2019;s trying to stay ahead by branching out a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. She paused, frowning a little. I blushed....</p></p><h2>Worlds Collide (Exclusive Edition) (The Land of Stories Series #6) Release Date (July 11 2017)</h2><p>This special edition includes &#34;Mother Goose Interviews Chris Colfer,&#34; a never-before-seen original piece written by Chris Colfer exclusively for his biggest fans.

Is something bothering you?&#x201d; Amalia&#x2019;s grandmother removed the boiling honey from the stovetop to let it cool. Then she wiped her forehead with a tissue and looked at her granddaughter. The light from the setting sun entered the small window over the sink with a soft glow. The geraniums on the windowsill added a subtle hint of pink. &#x201c;You are too quiet, hijita. Tell me what&#x2019;s bothering you,&#x201d; her grandmother insisted. &#x201c;It is obvious that something is wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Abuelita, de verdad. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amalia tried to sound convincing, but her grandmother continued, &#x201c;Is it because Martha did not come with you today? Is she all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Going to her grandmother&#x2019;s home on Friday afternoon was something Amalia had been doing since she was little. For the last two years, since they started fourth grade, her friend Martha accompanied her most Fridays. Every week Amalia looked forward to the time she spent at her grandmother&#x2019;s house. But today was different.<br> <br>Amalia paused before answering, &#x201c;She is not coming back anymore, Abuelita. �Nunca m�s!&#x201d; Despite Amalia&#x2019;s efforts to control her feelings, her voice cracked and her brown eyes watered.<br> <br>&#x201c;�Qu� pasa, hijita? What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Amalia&#x2019;s grandmother asked softly, gently hugging her and waiting for an explanation.<br> <br>Amalia shook her head, as she frequently did when she was upset, and her long black hair swept her shoulders. &#x201c;Martha is going away. Her family is moving west, to some weird place in California. So far away from Chicago! Today she had to go straight home to start packing. It&#x2019;s not fair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That must be difficult.&#x201d; Her grandmother&#x2019;s voice was filled with understanding, and Amalia let out a great sigh.<br> <br>For a while there was silence. The sunlight faded in the kitchen, and as the boiled honey cooled into a dark, thick mass, its sweet aroma filled the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall we knead the melcocha, then?&#x201d; Amalia&#x2019;s grandmother asked as she lifted the old brass pot onto the kitchen table and poured the sticky melcocha into a bowl. The thick white porcelain bowl, with a few chips that spoke of its long use, had a wide yellow rim. Once, the bowl had made Amalia think that it looked like a small sun on the kitchen table. Today she was too upset to see anything but the heavy bowl.<br> <br>They washed their hands thoroughly in the sink and dried them. Her grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen towels each had a day of the week embroidered in a different color. Since today was Friday, the cross-stitched embroidery spelled viernes in azul marino, deep blue. Abuelita had taught Amalia the days of the week and the names of the colors in Spanish using these towels. Although her grandmother never seemed to be teaching, Amalia was frequently surprised when she realized how many things she had learned from Abuelita.<br> <br>After drying their hands, they slathered them with soft butter, which prevented the taffy from sticking to their fingers or burning their skin. Then, with a large wooden spoon, Abuelita scooped some taffy from the bowl and poured it onto their hands.<br> <br>As they pulled and kneaded, the taffy became softer and lighter. They placed little rolls of amber-colored taffy on pieces of waxed paper. Amalia had helped her grandmother pull the melcocha many times, but she never ceased to marvel at how the sweet taffy changed color just from being pulled, kneaded, and pulled again. It transformed from a deep dark brown into a light blond color, just like Martha&#x2019;s hair. Thinking about Martha made Amalia frown.<br> <br>Her grandmother might have seen her expression but made no comment about it. Rather, she said, &#x201c;Wash your hands well, Amalita. Let&#x2019;s sit for a moment while the taffy cools down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before washing her hands, Amalia licked her fingers. Nothing tasted as good as &#x201c;cleaning up&#x201d; after cooking. The butter and taffy mixed together made a sweet caramel on her fingers, which was every bit as good as the raw cookie dough they &#x201c;cleaned up&#x201d; when she and Martha made cookies at Martha&#x2019;s house.<br> <br>Once Amalia had washed and dried her hands, she followed her grandmother to the living room. They both sat on the floral sofa, which brightened the room as if a piece of the garden had been brought inside the house. Abuelita&#x2019;s fondness for the colors of nature could be seen in each room of her house.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know how hard it is when someone you love goes away. One moment you are angry, then you become sad, and then it seems so unbelievable you almost erase it. Then, when you realize it is true, the anger and the sadness come back all over again, sometimes even more painfully than before. I have gone through that many times.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amalia listened closely, trying to guess who her grandmother was talking about. Was she thinking of her two sons who lived far away or her daughter who always promised to visit from Mexico City but never did? Or was she referring to her husband, Amalia&#x2019;s grandfather, who had died when Amalia was so young that she could not remember him?<br> <br>&#x201c;But one finds ways, Amalia, to keep them close,&#x201d; her grandmother added. And then, smiling as if having just gotten a new idea, she said, &#x201c;Ven. Come with me.&#x201d; She then got up and motioned Amalia to follow her to the dining room.<br> <br>Amalia just wanted to end the conversation. It was bad enough that Martha had told her that she had a surprise and it had turned out to be that Martha was moving to California very soon. Martha&#x2019;s leaving sounded so definite and permanent that she hated even the thought of it. Talking about it only made Amalia feel worse. She wished she did not need to wait for her father to pick her up and could just walk home. Maybe then she could call Martha and hear her say that it all had been a great mistake and they were not moving after all. And it would all disappear like bad dreams do in the morning.</p><h2>A Girl and Five Brave Horses</h2><p>2011 Reprint edition of 1961. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Sonora Carver was an American entertainer, most notable as one of the first female horse divers. Carver answered an ad placed by &#34;Doc&#34; William Frank Carver in 1923 for a diving girl and soon earned a place in circus history. Her job was to mount a running horse as it reached the top of a forty-foot (sometimes sixty-foot) tower and sail down along the animal&#39;s back as it plunged into a deep pool of water directly below. Sonora was a sensation and soon became the lead diving girl for Doc Carver&#39;s act as they traveled the country. In 1931, Sonora was blinded, a retinal detachment, due to hitting the water off-balance with her eyes open.while diving her horse, Red Lips, on New Jersey&#39;s Steel Pier, the act&#39;s permanent home since 1929. After her accident Sonora continued to dive horses until 1942.</p><p></p>
